00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 all good guys are back with 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.390
 on my channel with a new video today 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 I finally came back with a video of 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.590
 hansel warfare where for the first time 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.940
 I bring you full gameplay 1 and play a 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.250
 my opinion very very nice to see 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.040
 as it is a game 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.600
 indeed not just a few clips of 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.309
 team deathmatch that he has 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.059
 played on the map outside even one 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.030
 of my favorites 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.800
 using this balbin center the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.559
 game precisely that you are seeing yes 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.420
 it's a 34 solo play on 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.100
 deathmatch where I think I have 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.470
 reached the soulless and then died 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.040
 in a stupid way I don't know but it's over 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.970
 game still type 19 and therefore yes 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 I think it's the game enough 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.070
 appreciable to see because it is a lot 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.690
 left I didn't ask for an area 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.909
 as always in merchandise I leave 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.290
 everywhere and I tried to bring it 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.450
 at the end the nuclear result 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.010
 unfortunately the game but it's over 19 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.720
 I have done even better 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.940
 arrived after the brutal however like 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.650
 in fact you have already obviously understood not 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
 I managed to finish in 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 dna to bomber nor nuclear 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.619
 this because because in these first 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.619
 days I could see that anyone 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.990
 uploaded a dna bomb a url up 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.020
 youtube 90 percent or even of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.090
 most are made in groups of 56 sometimes 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.399
 but two is always in a group that you understand 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.340
 already a companion who viteral wav is one 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.119
 this is very useful instead 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.399
 game 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.560
 I was playing alone as well as the 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.780
 rest of the other three days of play 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.240
 I played more than to make gameplay I have 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.710
 played to level like all the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.310
 mortals in fact looking up 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.810
 youtube 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.729
 I was surprised seeing the people that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 already at level 1 they were already in a group 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.119
 maybe to try to make bank for 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 try doing some gameplay because a 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 my opinion inconceivable I would say how 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.340
 First of all I learn the game well 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.320
 I'm good at the spots and then when 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.429
 I'm finally complete start at 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.649
 bring fills of high thickness 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.600
 however I believe that you can already on Tuesday 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.880
 appreciate some dna or otherwise 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.190
 some nuclear because tonight after having 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.050
 turned off after turning off after doing 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.580
 this match I have other outputs 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.500
 nice nice games where I still do 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.390
 I approached the maximum results of 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.940
 this game so yes I would say of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.489
 prepare yourself for a return from Tuesday 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.750
 of Deathmatch 'and it's someone 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.190
 the question will also remain the same 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.660
 deathmatch like in the other kodo ti 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.860
 will move and maybe even do 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.630
 against but I will stay on deathmatch 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.520
 because in any case the way in which 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.170
 I grew the way for which 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.940
 many of you know me and so I have 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.380
 decided to take it forward like this 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.000
 look at some campers 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.740
 I decided to carry this out 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.090
 on deathmatch 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.590
 I will try to make the best gameplay of 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.320
 such precisely on this modality as 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 more and more accustomed and therefore I hope nothing 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.420
 just you can be happy with 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.920
 this is my choice 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.390
 now maybe we go a bit 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.610
 analyze the game a little more thoroughly 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.320
 not only from the point of view of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.130
 map so but maybe even a little 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.600
 advice 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.070
 I would start by saying that the weapon I have 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.530
 used is perhaps the strongest of 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.730
 this game at least as far as it can 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.740
 having found these early days 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.750
 it is indeed a ball 27 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.820
 equipped with a football silencer 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.950
 adjustable handle and kick 3 because 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.270
 sorry 3 accessories that anyway 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.040
 they are indispensable on this rifle 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.020
 assault this assault rifle 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.570
 just surprised me a lot as the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.950
 I had the first day of play 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.990
 used yes but I didn't like it 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.480
 quite as if suddenly 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.030
 had changed it has become a weapon that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.890
 I immediately started to love to love 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.100
 so guys now start the streep 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.080
 for the soulless that will then go 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.670
 almost to be nuclear fever that 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.320
 anyway when you have around 20 yes 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.720
 can already consider nuclear fail e 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.580
 I must say though that I can do one 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.170
 small criticism this game is the 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.640
 criticism that I want to make relative 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.930
 the street of assault in fact I do not 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.400
 they liked it for nothing 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.200
 as you will understand I am talking 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.240
 obviously deri with well second year 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.540
 it was a nice triple I think they will know 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.980
 of the rewards that is the paladin that 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.140
 however the highest reward is not me 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.040
 liked a lot because I think later 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 having made 12 13 kg to get to 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.660
 reward 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.670
 one expects more than just one 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.430
 talk medium every 20 seconds must 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:15.350
 recharge and that lasts 30 seconds then 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.060
 here I would have preferred a series of 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.820
 rewards a little more bad proof well 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.380
 we are satisfied and I will try to 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.360
 do as I've always done on deathmatch 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.460
 i will play not lethal without stripes and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.230
 we will see what I can get out of it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.820
 anyway now guys i think this one 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.890
 part of the game you have to look at it 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.150
 because really very very compelling it does 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.310
 what I think is a triple now of 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.720
 bombing and then look at it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.020
 because anyway it will really amuse you 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.900
 pretty winning nice to look at 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.370
 then guys what else to tell you this map 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.710
 horizon I recommend you take it 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.720
 especially on the bottom and not on the top 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.100
 like many other maps because you can 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.540
 see very closed with a lot 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.740
 playable even in enclosed spaces from 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.810
 your little tactical advice that 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.790
 however it can always serve and how 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.220
 just see the game despite 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.500
 perhaps in the mode obviously with the former 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.150
 because now despite me initially 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.150
 was fond of the one with the 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.670
 old streaks without ex with the old ones 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.200
 ways to play then I started 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.270
 appreciate this particularly ho 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.370
 started playing this tung guys 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.570
 as you can see which is the paladin e thin 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.300
 I will do very few 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.690
 because the biolab map is here 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.510
 really quite closed and make a 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.310
 gameplay here with the shovel to try 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.110
 doing something with the paladin pal years is 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.400
 really very, very complicated and there 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.590
 I tried the same thing those three 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.020
 four kisses that still have me 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.700
 helped yes but not much in the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.980
 reaching the core 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.480
 maybe if I had one more tapes 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.310
 strong if there had been tapes that ad 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.810
 example praise will be half beetle evening is 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.030
 come out to materialize more easily 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.990
 that result but unfortunately it was not 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.070
 so 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.540
 here guys now the video is 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.270
 coming to an end and I really hope that 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.190
 you enjoyed it anyway because I believe 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.470
 is the last video without performance in the 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.720
 sense without nuclear power without DNA because from 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.360
 Monday or Tuesday I will start 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.280
 really load you top gameplay on this one 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.720
 modalities however boys which added 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920
 the term i hope you enjoyed if 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.090
 so invitation let me like a
