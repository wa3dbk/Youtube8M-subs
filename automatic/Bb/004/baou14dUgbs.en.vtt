00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
stepped you see we can't hear anything

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.029 
stepped you see we can't hear anything
we<00:01:41.910> don't<00:01:42.060> hear<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.360> single<00:01:42.780> step<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.830> is

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
we don't hear a single step this is

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.270 
we don't hear a single step this is
because<00:01:45.619> when<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.979> jump<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.939> hear<00:01:48.270> you're

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
because when you jump you hear you're

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
because when you jump you hear you're
you're<00:01:50.280> starting<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.970> starting<00:01:51.540> footstep<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
you're starting to starting footstep but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980 
you're starting to starting footstep but
you<00:01:53.070> can't<00:01:53.340> hear<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.580> from<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> enemy<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you can't hear it from the enemy the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
you can't hear it from the enemy the
reason<00:01:55.320> why<00:01:55.470> it's<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.830> silent<00:01:56.040> jump<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.670> because

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
reason why it's a silent jump is because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.990 
reason why it's a silent jump is because
he's<00:01:57.330> landing<00:01:57.780> higher<00:01:58.220> than<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> ground

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
he's landing higher than on the ground

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.260 
he's landing higher than on the ground
so<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:01.020> making<00:02:01.409> any<00:02:01.680> noise<00:02:02.060> alright<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so it's not making any noise alright so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
so it's not making any noise alright so
that's<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.689> considered<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.350> well<00:02:04.590> whenever

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520
