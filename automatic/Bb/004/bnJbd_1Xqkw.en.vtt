00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
cell phones killing us this is a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.470 
cell phones killing us this is a
question<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.930> one<00:00:07.200> y'all<00:00:07.410> asked<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.480> you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
question that one y'all asked and you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.850 
question that one y'all asked and you
know<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.599> think<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> question<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.410> relation

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
know I think the question is in relation

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.560 
know I think the question is in relation
to<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.250> amount<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.580> radiation<00:00:11.940> small<00:00:12.360> amount

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
to the amount of radiation small amount

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.270 
to the amount of radiation small amount
of<00:00:12.660> radiation<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.049> may<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.500> emanating<00:00:13.860> or<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of radiation that may be emanating or is

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.740 
of radiation that may be emanating or is

our DNA as human beings but you know did
it<00:00:31.289> cause<00:00:31.410> cancer<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.700> question<00:00:33.270> whether

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it cause cancer there's question whether

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
or not they actually do cause cancer in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
you got to be paying attention to what's
here<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:34.049> videos<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:35.100> suck

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
here in my videos would probably suck

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.999 
here in my videos would probably suck
even<00:01:35.549> more<00:01:35.700> than<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.530> was

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
even more than they do now if I was

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.690 
even more than they do now if I was
doing<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.369> yeah<00:01:39.119> um<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.049> think<00:01:40.860> cell<00:01:41.460> phones

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
doing this yeah um I think cell phones

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.300 
doing this yeah um I think cell phones
are<00:01:42.320> killing<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.670> mm-hmm<00:01:48.920> they're<00:01:49.920> killing<00:01:50.220> us

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
are killing it mm-hmm they're killing us

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
are killing it mm-hmm they're killing us
just<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:51.960> most

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
just not in the way that I think most

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
just not in the way that I think most
people<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.770> they're<00:01:53.100> killing<00:01:53.460> us<00:01:53.490> but

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
people think they're killing us but

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.490 
people think they're killing us but
that's<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.360> leave<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> argument

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that's not to leave out the argument

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.319 
that's not to leave out the argument
once<00:01:55.649> again<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.469> wireless<00:01:59.329> stuff

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
once again that all this wireless stuff
