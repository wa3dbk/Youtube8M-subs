 Welcome to the video tutorial mode of 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.570
 magnetecs bones today we will see how to do 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.670
 an organizer for the desk with 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.990
 recycled boats the materials that 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.539
 we're going to need 100 mana 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.519
 glue zeal scissors and ones 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.439
 pieces of wrapping paper in closeup 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.380
 place we are going to roll up the boat with the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 Paper gift 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 a little bit of glue 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.460
 when we reached the end we would return 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.420
 to make sure we can put a little 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.420
 of zeal 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.370
 and we will repeat the process with all 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.860
 boats that we are going to use in our 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.080
 case they are going to be 6 we already have all the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.500
 lined boats as you see we have chosen 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 two colors the purple and the pink and one 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.990
 Once we have them we are going to assemble , we are going 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.160
 to mount them as a ladder in the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.970
 from below 3 2 and 1 we will start by putting together 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.970
 these 2 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.170
 we will take a little tail we will put 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.789
 in the extremes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.150
 and what we will do 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.879
 now we will put together another one and we will do what 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.879
 same 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.930
 and this will be the first floor we have put 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.950
 the next one that we will put between 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.989
 these two 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.989
 we put again tail 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.880
 and what's going 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.870
 and now we will put the keel here 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.530
 finally let's put the one on top of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.080
 this form 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.080
 we will queue at the bottom 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.349
 we press a little 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.740
 once we have all the boats mounted 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.690
