what is on my veena below a CPM buddy
here<00:00:15.059> bring<00:00:15.480> her<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> throw<00:00:15.870> now<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.379> your

here bring her to throw now to make your
battery<00:00:16.710> life<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> good<00:00:17.430> piece<00:00:17.670> for

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
battery life on a good piece for

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.580 
battery life on a good piece for
controller<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.600> little<00:00:19.020> bit<00:00:19.109> longer<00:00:19.289> at

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
controller that's a little bit longer at

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
controller that's a little bit longer at
least<00:00:19.619> 30<00:00:20.070> minutes<00:00:20.250> 40<00:00:21.150> minutes<00:00:21.180> 40<00:00:21.990> minutes

least 30 minutes 40 minutes 40 minutes
estimated<00:00:22.800> time<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.220> would<00:00:24.119> normally<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.840> know

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
estimated time I would normally you know

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
estimated time I would normally you know
before<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> even<00:00:25.619> figure<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> little

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
before I even figure out this little

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.779 
before I even figure out this little
theory<00:00:27.260> was<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> little<00:00:28.680> helpful<00:00:29.369> tip<00:00:29.580> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
theory was a little helpful tip that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
theory was a little helpful tip that
could<00:00:30.090> make<00:00:30.660> mind<00:00:30.900> control<00:00:31.260> last<00:00:31.410> longer

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
could make mind control last longer

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.709 
could make mind control last longer
I<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.399> always<00:00:32.520> favor<00:00:32.820> elaboration<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.510> Call

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
I would always favor elaboration on Call

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.540 
I would always favor elaboration on Call
of<00:00:33.750> Duty<00:00:34.079> where<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> beat<00:00:34.680> any<00:00:35.100> other<00:00:35.370> game

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of Duty where the beat any other game

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
of Duty where the beat any other game
and<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.180> always<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.510> vibration<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and I always have vibration on and I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
and I always have vibration on and I
always<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.670> complain<00:00:39.210> about<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
always you know complain about the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
always you know complain about the
battery<00:00:39.899> life<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:41.010> know<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.219> doesn't<00:00:41.399> last

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
battery life it you know it doesn't last

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
battery life it you know it doesn't last
that<00:00:41.730> long<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.329> only<00:00:42.420> lasted<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.079> hours

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that long and only lasted for two hours

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.229 
that long and only lasted for two hours
I<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:45.000> always

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I was gonna get up I'm always

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
I was gonna get up I'm always
comfortable<00:00:45.480> when<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:45.960> sitting<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.920> just

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
comfortable when I'm sitting and it just

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180 
comfortable when I'm sitting and it just
I<00:00:47.550> wanted<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> make<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.539> last<00:00:48.629> longer<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.190> just

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I wanted to make it last longer so just

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.229 
I wanted to make it last longer so just
giving<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.789> quick<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.210> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
giving you a little quick just where I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.680 
giving you a little quick just where I
had<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.930> head<00:00:52.320> over<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> settings<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
had this so head over to settings and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
had this so head over to settings and
head<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.960> devices<00:00:55.850> and<00:00:56.850> over

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
head over to devices and over

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
head over to devices and over
controllers<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.640> hand<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.910> over

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
controllers and then then hand it over

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.750 
controllers and then then hand it over
then<00:01:00.539> uncheck<00:01:01.020> vibration<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> why<00:01:02.280> every

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
then uncheck vibration this is why every

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640 
then uncheck vibration this is why every
time<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:03.149> controller<00:01:03.510> rumbles<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.260> takes

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
time your controller rumbles it takes

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
time your controller rumbles it takes
one<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> juice<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> brightness

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
one or the juice so does the brightness

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.730 
one or the juice so does the brightness
of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> light<00:01:06.540> bar<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of the light bar so if you have that on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
of the light bar so if you have that on
brightness<00:01:08.369> FL<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.180> super<00:01:09.420> bright<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.960> too

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
brightness FL it's super bright like too

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
brightness FL it's super bright like too
bright<00:01:11.159> light<00:01:11.369> shine<00:01:12.000> bright<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> diamond

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
bright light shine bright like a diamond

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
bright light shine bright like a diamond
I<00:01:13.020> guess<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> could<00:01:13.439> say<00:01:14.090> lords<00:01:15.090> dim<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I guess you could say lords dim like

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.240 
I guess you could say lords dim like
always<00:01:15.960> lower<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.590> dim<00:01:16.970> these<00:01:17.970> two<00:01:18.299> would

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
always lower to dim these two would

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
always lower to dim these two would
these<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> main<00:01:21.479> thing<00:01:21.509> why

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
these two are like the main thing why

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.820 
these two are like the main thing why
the<00:01:22.020> battery<00:01:22.439> life<00:01:22.650> always<00:01:23.659> runs<00:01:24.659> out<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.259> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the battery life always runs out some so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.179 
the battery life always runs out some so
fast<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:27.049> part<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> charge<00:01:29.040> your

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
fast like part you know you charge your

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.679 
fast like part you know you charge your
phone<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.790> safer<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.450> 30<00:01:30.630> minutes

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
phone it's just safer a good 30 minutes

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.569 
phone it's just safer a good 30 minutes
then<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.350> start<00:01:31.590> playing<00:01:31.710> games<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.189> one

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
then you start playing games like one

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.609 
then you start playing games like one

life would you know die eventually

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.340 
because you be using too many apps and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
run so much that it has to you know die
out<00:01:46.530> sometime<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.210> same

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
out sometime so that's like the same

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.590 
out sometime so that's like the same
cost<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> controller<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.700> unchecking

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
cost as a controller so just unchecking

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
cost as a controller so just unchecking
the<00:01:51.810> enable<00:01:52.020> vibrations<00:01:52.920> thought<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the enable vibrations thought about that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
the enable vibrations thought about that
but<00:01:53.970> yet<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.799> used<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
but yet you're gonna have to get used to
