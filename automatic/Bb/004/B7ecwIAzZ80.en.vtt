00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.200
 I 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 what a black wave and then I do not bring them 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.100
 of revision another package texture more and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.779
 good is another ported by obed or a 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.640
 carrier that we already know about textures and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.140
 well it has a weird name as free 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 ding 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 art so the truth is the name is fine 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.680
 weird I will not be in the description 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 of the video directly from the forum so that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 download it using the blog 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.300
 launcher in its latest version the blog 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 launcher but they already find it and I 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.570
 has data so you can look it up in 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.770
 my store is december left the links 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.500
 in the description the whole description 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.840
 and I liked how it changes the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.630
 golden color of the buttons very nice 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.640
 I do not know why they almost do not use this type 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.170
 of configurations in the portage of 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.250
 texture that is also very good 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.560
 all this not for the house always we 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.980
 carry to the bottom and the items but you do not 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.190
 modify the system so it's very simple and 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.310
 It looks very nice combines more than anything 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.790
 well I do not want to leave 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.040
 let's go to the world of textures 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 and well that's how we're going to appreciate 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 between the blocks put are the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.030
 blocks of mine or the blocks that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.830
 we found in the caves 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.630
 the different types of sand things 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 that we plant or the seeds that we already 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.670
 carrots grew in this case 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.020
 the potatoes the beets how are they called 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:36.230
 wheat watermelon melon blocks 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.650
 of stones the earth blocks 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.470
 this is his 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.260
 colored sand or clay I think 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 that clay is wood if you see the 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.410
 wood 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.840
 here we have what would be ice some 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.060
 already diverse materials the varga la 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.950
 Sponge and berries forgive the sponge 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.210
 There is a silver fish pinche in which 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.700
 come always go by passing all the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.430
 click map but good we have the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.610
 Little flowers do not have a shader 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.290
 nothing is simple is 16 by 16 here we have 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.320
 everything would be colored wool 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.990
 with their respective mats and here 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.510
 we have what would be the paintings that 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.150
 they have but with that of the lord of the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 rings' 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.640
 I hit you with a fucking friend here 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.010
 is your box after a box every time 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.439
 that a picture must be the ship that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 it looks like gold and there's a 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.060
 silver fisiatra 12 so that you vargas 6 el 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.630
 click fish and here are the faces 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.460
 of penis that would be the pinches 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.170
 never never without anything else to be there in 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.540
 the earth back 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.130
 speak seriously fiscal build here 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.690
 there are the logos that look like bastards 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.970
 I like how about the logos are 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.920
 gasoline or gas the sheep and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.080
 a sheep league neither the league nor ganigan and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.790
 the little pigs are the little pigs with the face 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.040
 what the fuck the vaquitas with face 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.170
 what of the chickens that I think not 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.720
 what they did because they look normal 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.820
 the bald and bald villagers look alike 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.590
 my history teacher also click 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.410
 bald my former teacher lost no longer 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.290
 I have a teacher and here is what you are 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.720
 cows cows avoid clippers 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.860
 in child-age flights his mother I think 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.200
 that were the spiders here are the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.580
 normal spiders and cave spiders that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.710
 they look great so green has it 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.510
 delighted here are the pickman that 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.460
 they have the skeleton face it stops 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.320
 because in the skeleton wall and here not 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.270
 the zombies like symbols I think it 's 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.310
 the zombies fought with the clippers 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.050
 and they were in their artist mother we 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.130
 say and win or level goni or anÃ­bal 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.110
 that look a little more purple 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.060
 here should be the silver ones 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.290
 fish that are always lost and here 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.620
 It should be a fucking 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.659
 it's line is not the green thing the smoke 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.269
 as some say and good guys is what 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.010
 that would be all for this texture all 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.890
 what it brings and we're going to finally enter 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.150
 to play a magicians from the beginning is what 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.920
 that one of the things that we liked 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.859
 the start of very nice calls a lot the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.180
 attention let's go to survival 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.159
 let's see what the new world looks like in 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.299
 survival and that's how you're going to see your 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.099
 world if you go to play with this texture 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.099
 it looks very nice the green is this green 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.060
 I really like the order and the 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.769
 animals stand out in spite of the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.599
 of the colors despite all the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.459
 animals are highlighted they are seen there 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.930
 textures that sometimes you're walking in 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.759
 the grass and you do not see the animals until 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.130
 that you do not approach and it does not observe them 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.910
 very well by far the sun looks very 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.000
 beautiful 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.289
 so fucking motorcycle so good guys 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.849
 I hope you liked the texture 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.039
 will be in the description of the video together 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.720
 with everything and then nothing thanks to see 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.910
 continue to carry good carnal textures 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.590
 always strong at 16 x 16 is something very 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.590
