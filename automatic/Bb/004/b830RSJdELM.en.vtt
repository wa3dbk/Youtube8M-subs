00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
running around a bit and I think he was

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.510 
running around a bit and I think he was
excited<00:05:45.050> even<00:05:45.500> though<00:05:45.680> he<00:05:45.860> probably<00:05:46.009> doesn't

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
excited even though he probably doesn't

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.999 
excited even though he probably doesn't
even<00:05:46.639> know<00:05:47.199> understand<00:05:48.199> what<00:05:48.349> I'm<00:05:48.469> saying<00:05:48.740> I

know<00:05:49.219> what<00:05:49.370> I<00:05:49.400> mean<00:05:49.719> but<00:05:50.719> I<00:05:51.020> think<00:05:52.009> he<00:05:52.129> knows

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
know what I mean but I think he knows

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.040

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.189 
that I love my Taylor Swift and that
