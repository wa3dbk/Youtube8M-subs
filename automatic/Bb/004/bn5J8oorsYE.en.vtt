00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
simmer she's just feeling to see how

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.220 
simmer she's just feeling to see how
tender<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.920> UH<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:32.480> beans<00:01:32.720> are<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.020> see<00:01:33.170> if

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
tender the UH the beans are to see if

they're<00:01:33.380> cooked<00:01:33.620> all<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.890> way<00:01:33.920> yet<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:34.880> you

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
they're cooked all the way yet so you

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.200

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
can do this with QT beans pinto beans

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.630 
can do this with QT beans pinto beans

them with black beans white beans or

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.350 
them with black beans white beans or
split<00:01:44.450> peas<00:01:44.660> if<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:45.200> buy<00:01:45.460> let<00:01:46.460> me<00:01:46.550> show<00:01:46.700> you<00:01:46.760> if

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
split peas if you buy let me show you if

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.970 
split peas if you buy let me show you if
you<00:01:47.570> buy<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:49.810> green<00:01:51.310> beans<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.710> beans

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
you buy the green beans do that beans

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.200 
you buy the green beans do that beans
the<00:01:55.220> peas

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the peas

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.560 
the peas
these<00:01:56.870> split<00:01:57.770> teams<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.150> make<00:01:59.299> them<00:01:59.450> with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
these split teams you can make them with

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.870 
these split teams you can make them with
these<00:01:59.750> as<00:01:59.990> well<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.250> would<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> same

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
these as well so you would do the same

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.060 
these as well so you would do the same
same<00:02:02.330> method<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.590> let<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
same method you let it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.940 
same method you let it
so<00:02:04.900> these<00:02:05.900> probably<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.380> want<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.590> have<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so these probably you want to have to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.859 
so these probably you want to have to
you<00:02:07.640> would<00:02:07.700> have<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.970> self<00:02:08.209> these<00:02:08.390> as<00:02:08.630> long

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
you would have to self these as long

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.210 
you would have to self these as long
because<00:02:09.200> they<00:02:09.319> don't<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.740> shell<00:02:10.069> on

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
because they don't have that shell on

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.420 
because they don't have that shell on
there<00:02:10.399> they're<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.729> as<00:02:10.850> tough<00:02:11.150> as<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.660> um

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
there they're not as tough as the um

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.650 
there they're not as tough as the um
that's<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.670> other<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.030> beans<00:02:17.330> no

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
that's the other all of the beans no

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.630 
that's the other all of the beans no
matter<00:02:17.810> what<00:02:18.580> yes<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:21.190> only<00:02:22.190> one<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.520> she

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
matter what yes this only one that she

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.860

had<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> silk<00:02:23.030> overnight<00:02:23.360> because<00:02:23.600> they're<00:02:23.720> so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
had a silk overnight because they're so
