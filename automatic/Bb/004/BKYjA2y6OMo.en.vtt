00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.980
Once upon a time

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.920
You were once known as Irong-Irong

I give pride to your name

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.580
I'll take pride of what has been done

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.160
Of your ancestors and your children

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.380
Helping each other on the move for progress

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.200
Hala Bira Iloilo!

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.280
Onwards to change

Hala Bira Iloilo!

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.060

Hala Bira Iloilo!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840
We're proud of your name

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.720

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.780
As time passes by

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.660
You're known for so many things

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.040
Your Dinagyang and your Kasadyahan
