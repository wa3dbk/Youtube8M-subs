 you can do in the mixer the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.680
 minister on the same hand who does not have 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 problem is that I'll put the açaí I 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 buy that frozen pulp you know 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.500
 so you say freeze she needs 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.360
 microwave even though it does not 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 it can be frozen and it will not spoil 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.409
 slaughtered with guarana but if you find 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 that's okay 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.970
 the condensed milk that I'm going to leave 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.210
 everything is even better a little bit 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210
 milk and sour cream 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.450
 everything in here is just us 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.530
 hit very well 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.060
 after all I'm going to add 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.350
 unflavored gelatin 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.690
 I follow the manufacturer's instructions 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.430
 that I bought then you follow too 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.869
 You risk not having an error but if you 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.460
 have questions or leave a link in the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 video description of how to teach 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.080
 hydrate smoothly and now only 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.560
 people hit everything again to be well 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 this gelatin 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.659
 good after everything well beaten it's just you 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.130
 It is very well your hunger even she 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.450
 were different because we did not want to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.970
 that exploded in no big way 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.130
 these people move everything to shape and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.740
 wait patiently for three hours and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.869
 then just enjoy it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.439
 how could I have been ready and now 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.439
 we taste 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.340
 It gets super soft if you like the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.230
 health taste can be very strong 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 I recommend you take the milk trade 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.670
 for açaí that will get much stronger 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.200
 taste but also everything will depend on the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 That's when you buy mine. It was good. 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.520
 weakened by being beaten with guarana and 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 A great recipe for the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.670
 summer 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:41.660
 to start as Paul is like a laugh 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.650
 male mean comes from witch I do not know 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:52.720
