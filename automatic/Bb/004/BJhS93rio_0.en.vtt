that this works is you want to take a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.279 
that this works is you want to take a
brush<00:00:41.360> that<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.540> intend<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.110> using<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:45.289> take

brush that you intend on using and take
the<00:00:46.610> substrate<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> work<00:00:49.170> with

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the substrate that you want to work with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.410 
the substrate that you want to work with
and<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.930> apply<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> product<00:00:53.840> using<00:00:56.420> using

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
it on and and get started with it this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.260 
it on and and get started with it this
way<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:07.140> way<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.560> strippers<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
way the way that strippers work is that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
way the way that strippers work is that
it's<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.930> bolete<00:01:10.350> beneath<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's going to go bolete beneath the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's going to go bolete beneath the
surface<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> break<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
surface and it's going to break the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
surface and it's going to break the
chemical<00:01:13.020> bond<00:01:13.530> between<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.760> coating<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
chemical bond between the coating and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.920 
chemical bond between the coating and
the<00:01:15.869> substrate<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.700> aid<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the substrate and to aid that one of the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
the substrate and to aid that one of the
things<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> help<00:01:20.100> speed

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
things that you can do to help speed

razor to the surface you're working on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.780 
razor to the surface you're working on
but<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.619> don't<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> go<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.340> heavy<00:01:41.549> with

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but you don't want to go very heavy with

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
but you don't want to go very heavy with
it<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.390> score<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> surface<00:01:43.200> what

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it but just to score the surface what

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
it but just to score the surface what
that<00:01:43.619> will<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.009> speed<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.880> process<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that will do is speed up the process of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.300 
that will do is speed up the process of
the<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.729> stripper<00:01:48.740> being<00:01:49.740> able<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.009> work

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the of the stripper being able to work
