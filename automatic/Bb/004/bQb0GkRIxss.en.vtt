00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.880
 it hurt us 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.610
 what hurt us but comes from a culture things don't change sex 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 hard filth cannot go because unfortunately the cult 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.570
 people to everything that comes from outside 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 a characteristic feature of Italian 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.149
 Unfortunately 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.939
 I say unfortunately but it is one of those with a difficult hereditary character 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.670
 defeat 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.329

 criteria of those who decide do not discount 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:04.309
 there will never be.

 a thousand possibilities of expression but no one is committed by mistake 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.889
 this hurts because everyone

 personal on the tractor 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.659
 to become everyone else's clone 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:36.599
 it's a bit like when friends go and hear young boys behind one 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.589

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.499
 music takes advantage of it 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.750
 these young people, another problem that lacks personality like claudio 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.199
 you say 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.840
 not everyone wants to be the bosses someone is not a fall from the sky in 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.300
 shape with the models 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.120
 since a very sad model is missing. 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.439
 there is only one model to imitate 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.969
 Moreover 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.199

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.939
 that ar has a real manual skill 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.710

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.449
 to try your hand right 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.479
 then when. 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.520
 then you can't complain that he had cardboard boxes now 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.080
 so 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.089
 what should work now 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:18.379
 that is rekindling the critical sense of people to say this beautiful poste.it 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.289
 this is wrong this is correct but to say it with your own brain 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.289
 not because the famous writer famously says it
