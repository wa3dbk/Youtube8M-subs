00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
really going to test these laws because

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.959 
really going to test these laws because
some<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> state<00:00:53.219> laws<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
some of the state laws do make it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.630 
some of the state laws do make it
illegal<00:00:54.629> federally<00:00:55.170> maybe<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> case<00:00:56.460> but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
illegal federally maybe not the case but

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
illegal federally maybe not the case but
the<00:00:56.760> argument<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> I've<00:00:57.420> heard<00:00:57.660> from<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the argument that I've heard from the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
the argument that I've heard from the
industry<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> maybe<00:00:58.890> I'm<00:00:59.010> sure<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> would

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
industry and maybe I'm sure you would

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
industry and maybe I'm sure you would
probably<00:01:00.300> subscribe<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> may<00:01:01.500> be

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
probably subscribe to this it may be

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
probably subscribe to this it may be
articulated<00:01:02.250> better<00:01:02.370> than<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
articulated better than I can but if a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
articulated better than I can but if a
game<00:01:04.019> involves<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> skill<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.220> words<00:01:05.400> if

differently is that true in your mind
well<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.610> certainly<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> very<00:01:18.270> pertinent

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
well that's certainly a very pertinent

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
well that's certainly a very pertinent
argument<00:01:19.259> mostly<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.159> lot<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> state

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
argument mostly because a lot of state

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
argument mostly because a lot of state
law<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.720> gambling<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:23.100> that
