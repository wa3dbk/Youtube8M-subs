00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
figure for weekly where it'll look like

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940

Dolph<00:04:09.360> Ziggler<00:04:09.660> won<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> world<00:04:10.079> title<00:04:10.200> then

Dolph Ziggler won the world title then

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.190 
Dolph Ziggler won the world title then
it'll<00:04:11.130> look<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.489> Ryback<00:04:11.790> won<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.269> title<00:04:12.630> but

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
it'll look like Ryback won the title but

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.310 
it'll look like Ryback won the title but
then<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.620> turns<00:04:13.980> out<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.239> one<00:04:15.239> Dolph<00:04:15.959> Ziggler

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
then it turns out that one Dolph Ziggler

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.529 
then it turns out that one Dolph Ziggler
wasn't<00:04:16.650> allowed<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:16.919> cash<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.880> WWE

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
Ryback didn't beat Ziggler because

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
Ryback didn't beat Ziggler because
technically<00:04:23.789> he<00:04:24.000> wasn't<00:04:24.300> champion<00:04:24.690> and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
technically he wasn't champion and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.740 
technically he wasn't champion and
that's<00:04:25.289> your<00:04:25.440> only<00:04:25.590> way<00:04:25.830> out<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:27.300> problem

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that's your only way out the problem

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
that's your only way out the problem
you<00:04:28.290> killed<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.680> Hell<00:04:28.830> in<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:29.010> Cell<00:04:30.620> but<00:04:31.620> that's

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
you killed a Hell in a Cell but that's

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.900 
you killed a Hell in a Cell but that's
what<00:04:31.860> happens<00:04:32.310> when<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.550> have<00:04:32.640> gimmick

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
what happens when you have gimmick

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.400 
what happens when you have gimmick
pay-per-views<00:04:33.540> for<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> sake<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.140> having

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
pay-per-views for the sake of having

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.040 
pay-per-views for the sake of having
gimmick<00:04:34.920> pay-per-views<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.060> like<00:04:36.810> lance

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
gimmick pay-per-views I like lance

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.840 
gimmick pay-per-views I like lance
storms<00:04:37.380> idea<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.980> think<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:38.550> what<00:04:38.730> they

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
storms idea I think that's what they

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.180 
storms idea I think that's what they
should<00:04:39.090> do<00:04:39.240> will<00:04:39.930> they<00:04:40.050> do<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.680> don't<00:04:41.070> know

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
should do will they do that I don't know

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.580 
should do will they do that I don't know
they<00:04:41.580> may<00:04:41.730> very<00:04:42.000> well<00:04:42.150> hotshot<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.840> title<00:04:43.170> to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
they may very well hotshot the title to

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.920 
they may very well hotshot the title to
Ryback<00:04:44.010> but<00:04:44.640> if<00:04:44.730> he<00:04:44.850> wins<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.180> title<00:04:45.360> he

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
Ryback but if he wins the title he

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.420 
Ryback but if he wins the title he
better<00:04:45.960> not<00:04:46.290> lose<00:04:46.500> at<00:04:46.680> any<00:04:46.800> time<00:04:47.040> soon<00:04:47.310> because

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
better not lose at any time soon because

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.040 
better not lose at any time soon because
that<00:04:47.640> could<00:04:47.760> seriously<00:04:48.060> hurt<00:04:48.480> his<00:04:48.660> momentum

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
that could seriously hurt his momentum

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.070 
that could seriously hurt his momentum
actually<00:04:49.890> he<00:04:50.190> shouldn't<00:04:50.550> lose<00:04:50.670> period<00:04:51.540> dot

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
actually he shouldn't lose period dot

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.480 
actually he shouldn't lose period dot
and<00:04:52.670> in<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.790> co-main<00:04:53.970> we<00:04:54.750> have<00:04:54.960> big<00:04:55.650> show<00:04:55.890> vs

and in the co-main we have big show vs
sheamus<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:57.090> probably<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:58.080> worst<00:04:58.380> book<00:04:58.740> feud

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
sheamus and probably the worst book feud

sheamus and probably the worst book feud
in<00:04:59.280> recent<00:04:59.670> memory<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:01.140> what<00:05:01.350> i<00:05:01.380> mean<00:05:01.440> by<00:05:01.650> that

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
and their matches have been good so I

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.450

expect<00:05:45.660> Randy<00:05:46.020> Orton<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.500> kill<00:05:47.070> Del<00:05:47.250> Rio

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
expect Randy Orton to kill Del Rio

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.010 
expect Randy Orton to kill Del Rio
because<00:05:47.790> of<00:05:47.910> course<00:05:48.120> he<00:05:48.270> has<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.479> lose<00:05:48.600> every

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
because of course he has to lose every

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.260 
because of course he has to lose every
big<00:05:49.200> match<00:05:49.410> but<00:05:50.070> it<00:05:50.310> should<00:05:50.669> be<00:05:50.820> quite

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
big match but it should be quite

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.390
