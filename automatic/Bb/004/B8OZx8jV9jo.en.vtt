00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
packets and flavors and so I used to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660 
packets and flavors and so I used to
really<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.710> picking<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> making

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
really like picking one out and making

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.700 
really like picking one out and making
it<00:00:29.910> myself<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:30.929> difficult<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it myself because really difficult and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.260 
it myself because really difficult and
involves<00:00:32.130> pouring<00:00:32.340> powder<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> cup<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
involves pouring powder in a cup of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.729 
involves pouring powder in a cup of
water<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> microwave<00:00:34.200> look

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
water and put it in the microwave look

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.490 
water and put it in the microwave look
but<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> also<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:37.020> simple

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but this is this is also really simple

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.869 
but this is this is also really simple
and<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.010> doing<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.730> see

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and I'm just doing this so you can see

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
and I'm just doing this so you can see
how<00:00:39.030> easy<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.809> make<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.110> own<00:00:40.230> homemade

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
how easy it is to make your own homemade

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.530 
how easy it is to make your own homemade
hot<00:00:40.829> chocolate<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
hot chocolate you don't have to get the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
hot chocolate you don't have to get the
packets<00:00:42.930> anymore<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
packets anymore and because this is so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
packets anymore and because this is so
simple<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.329> probably<00:00:45.600> make<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.200> with

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
simple and you can probably make it with

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.590 
simple and you can probably make it with
things<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> already<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.579> hand<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
things that you already have on hand so

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.170 
things that you already have on hand so
let's<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.649> started<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.430> doing<00:00:50.940> are

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
let's get started what I'm doing are

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020 
let's get started what I'm doing are
starting<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> 2<00:00:52.320> cups<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> milk<00:00:53.030> you

starting out with is 2 cups of milk you
could<00:00:54.239> use<00:00:54.480> almond<00:00:54.930> milk<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.170> could<00:00:55.440> use

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
could use almond milk you could use

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.119 
could use almond milk you could use
nonfat<00:00:56.250> milk<00:00:56.960> full<00:00:57.960> fat<00:00:58.020> milk<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> really

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
nonfat milk full fat milk if you really

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
nonfat milk full fat milk if you really
want<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.609> rich<00:01:00.710> whatever<00:01:01.710> you've<00:01:01.980> got

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

want it to be rich whatever you've got
on<00:01:02.250> hand<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.180> I'm<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> turn<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
on hand so I'm going to turn this on to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.429 
on hand so I'm going to turn this on to
about<00:01:05.790> medium-high<00:01:06.479> heat<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
about medium-high heat and then just

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.620 
about medium-high heat and then just
like<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> bubble<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.850> around

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
like this to start to bubble up around

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.820 
like this to start to bubble up around
the<00:01:09.720> edges<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.290> I'll<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.799> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.550 
the edges and I'll show you what that
looks<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.280> when<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> gets<00:01:11.760> there

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
looks like when it gets there

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.929 
looks like when it gets there
okay<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.220> how<00:01:14.460> these<00:01:14.790> little

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
okay you can see how these little

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.540 
okay you can see how these little
bubbles<00:01:15.420> are<00:01:15.600> starting<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.049> form<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> milk

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
bubbles are starting to form in the milk

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.730 
bubbles are starting to form in the milk
getting<00:01:17.940> foam<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.440> ahead

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
getting foam so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.510 
getting foam so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:19.950> turn<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> heat<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.790> low<00:01:22.460> all<00:01:23.460> right

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and turn the heat down to low all right

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.390 
and turn the heat down to low all right
so<00:01:23.940> now<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.120> my<00:01:24.480> milk<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.350> warm<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:26.160> going<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
so now that my milk is warm I'm going to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
so now that my milk is warm I'm going to
go<00:01:26.520> ahead<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> add<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.180> cocoa<00:01:27.330> powder<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
go ahead and add in my cocoa powder and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.370 
go ahead and add in my cocoa powder and
I'm<00:01:28.650> using<00:01:28.830> unsweetened<00:01:29.460> cocoa<00:01:29.940> powder<00:01:30.380> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
I'm using unsweetened cocoa powder this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
I'm using unsweetened cocoa powder this
is<00:01:31.440> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.800> make<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.460> chocolatey

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
is going to make it really chocolatey

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.750 
is going to make it really chocolatey
without<00:01:33.510> adding<00:01:34.550> actually<00:01:35.550> more<00:01:35.880> sugar<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
without adding actually more sugar so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.940 
without adding actually more sugar so
get<00:01:38.760> this<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.480> and<00:01:39.660> when<00:01:40.380> heated<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.830> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get this in here and when heated at the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.470 
get this in here and when heated at the
chocolate<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.550> that<00:01:41.580> this<00:01:41.880> cocoa<00:01:42.270> powder

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
chocolate so that this cocoa powder

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.930 
chocolate so that this cocoa powder
could<00:01:42.780> actually<00:01:43.170> dissolve<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.370> all<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
could actually dissolve and all the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.220 
could actually dissolve and all the
other<00:01:45.090> ingredients<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
other ingredients can really just

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.740 
other ingredients can really just
dissolve<00:01:46.590> into<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.250> milk<00:01:47.580> but<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.270> didn't<00:01:48.600> heat

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
dissolve into a milk but we didn't heat
