to<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.340> initial<00:01:41.579> beep<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.299> again<00:01:43.200> we're

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to do an initial beep up again we're

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
to do an initial beep up again we're
going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> take<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> safety<00:01:44.250> step<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.759> make

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to take a safety step back make

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.450 
going to take a safety step back make
sure<00:01:45.140> if<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> does<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.740> off<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.100> need<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
sure if it does take off you need to be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
sure if it does take off you need to be
ready<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> fly<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.090> which<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:49.079> here

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
ready to fly it which I can do from here

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
ready to fly it which I can do from here
so<00:01:51.110> so<00:01:52.310> basically<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:54.240> point

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so so basically to get it to this point

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
so so basically to get it to this point
we're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.079> ahead<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.399> get<00:01:56.399> some

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
we're going to go ahead and get some

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.800 
we're going to go ahead and get some
flashing<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.469> DJ<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.299> little<00:02:00.299> unit

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
flashing here from this DJ I little unit

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
flashing here from this DJ I little unit
inside<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.649> I'm<00:02:02.100> flashing<00:02:02.460> red<00:02:02.909> right

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
inside of here so I'm flashing red right

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
inside of here so I'm flashing red right
now<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.810> GPS<00:02:04.350> unit<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
now and this is a GPS unit what that

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.600 
now and this is a GPS unit what that
means<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.579> don't<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.090> GPS<00:02:06.659> signal<00:02:07.250> if<00:02:08.250> we

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
means is I don't have a GPS signal if we

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.270 
means is I don't have a GPS signal if we
do<00:02:08.819> get<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> green<00:02:09.599> light<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.440> turns<00:02:10.800> solid

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
do get a green light and it turns solid

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880 
do get a green light and it turns solid
green<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.849> means<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.270> have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.870> GPS<00:02:13.440> signal

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
green it means that we have a GPS signal

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.369 
green it means that we have a GPS signal
we<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.280> all<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.790> GPS<00:02:15.300> or<00:02:15.599> all<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
we have all the GPS or all the

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.010 
we have all the GPS or all the
satellites<00:02:16.920> lined<00:02:17.610> up<00:02:17.879> so<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.720> flashing

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
satellites lined up so it's flashing

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.190 
satellites lined up so it's flashing
green<00:02:19.500> right<00:02:19.920> there<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.879> my<00:02:20.940> building<00:02:21.720> we

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
green right there in my building we

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.930 
green right there in my building we
might<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:22.709> one<00:02:22.980> signal<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> mean<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
might get one signal I mean this is a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.059 
might get one signal I mean this is a
metal<00:02:24.360> building<00:02:24.510> we're<00:02:24.870> inside<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.709> not

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
metal building we're inside so it's not

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.300 
metal building we're inside so it's not
going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> GPS<00:02:27.090> signal<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:27.599> here<00:02:28.310> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
going to get a GPS signal in here so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.339 
going to get a GPS signal in here so
when<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.180> are<00:02:30.510> when<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> go<00:02:30.989> through<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
when you are when you go through the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.930 
when you are when you go through the
different<00:02:31.440> modes<00:02:31.800> which<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.459> manual

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
different modes which is your manual

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.930 
different modes which is your manual
altitude<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.050> your<00:02:34.379> GPS<00:02:35.040> mode<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.910> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
altitude and your GPS mode when I go to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.530 
altitude and your GPS mode when I go to
GPS<00:02:36.480> mode<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.280> got<00:02:38.280> one<00:02:38.610> green<00:02:38.940> flashing<00:02:39.510> light

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
GPS mode I got one green flashing light

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.479 
GPS mode I got one green flashing light
which<00:02:39.870> means<00:02:40.110> i'm<00:02:40.319> getting<00:02:40.530> one<00:02:40.950> satellite

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
which means i'm getting one satellite

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.059 
which means i'm getting one satellite
signal<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.930> should<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.470> all<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
signal to it it should be all the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
signal to it it should be all the
satellites<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:45.000> should<00:02:45.180> be<00:02:45.330> solid<00:02:45.569> green

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
satellites and it should be solid green

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.780 
satellites and it should be solid green
before<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.739> trust<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.250> thing<00:02:47.519> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
before you go and trust this thing so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.059 
before you go and trust this thing so
I'm<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:48.930> even<00:02:48.989> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.290> fly<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.830> still

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
I'm not even going to fly you can still

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.680 
I'm not even going to fly you can still
flat<00:02:50.340> no<00:02:50.610> problem<00:02:51.060> you're<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.360> not<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.599> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
flat no problem you're just not going to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.030 
flat no problem you're just not going to
be<00:02:51.810> able<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.989> rely<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> GPS<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.620> go

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
be able to rely on the GPS so we can go

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.229 
be able to rely on the GPS so we can go
ahead<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.340> I'm<00:02:56.610> going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.910> ahead<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.060> show

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
ahead and I'm going to go ahead and show

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.399 
ahead and I'm going to go ahead and show
you<00:02:57.269> how<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.510> arm<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.930> i'm<00:02:58.050> going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.379> ahead

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
you how to arm it i'm going to go ahead

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.649 
you how to arm it i'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:58.620> unplug<00:02:59.099> this<00:02:59.489> because<00:03:00.150> i<00:03:00.180> don't<00:03:00.360> really

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
and unplug this because i don't really

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.390 
and unplug this because i don't really
want<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> fly<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.230> inside<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.800> i<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
want to fly it inside if i don't have to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.610 
want to fly it inside if i don't have to
and<00:03:02.810> there's<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.900> couple<00:03:04.050> different<00:03:04.260> ways<00:03:04.560> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and there's a couple different ways to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.520 
and there's a couple different ways to
arm<00:03:05.480> when<00:03:06.480> you're<00:03:06.599> ready<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.989> fly<00:03:07.230> what's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
arm when you're ready to fly what's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.309 
arm when you're ready to fly what's
going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.800> happen<00:03:08.159> is<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:09.360> way<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.140> I

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
going to happen is the way I do it is I

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.830 
going to happen is the way I do it is I
take<00:03:10.500> both<00:03:10.769> sticks<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> go<00:03:11.519> down<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.209> into

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
take both sticks and I go down and into

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.259 
take both sticks and I go down and into
each<00:03:12.989> other<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.099> then<00:03:14.879> what's

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
each other like this and then what's

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.300 
each other like this and then what's
going<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.569> happen<00:03:15.900> when<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.040> want

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
going to happen when I do that you want

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.559 
going to happen when I do that you want
to<00:03:17.370> make<00:03:17.489> sure<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.670> you're<00:03:17.879> far<00:03:18.150> enough<00:03:18.239> wick

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
to make sure that you're far enough wick

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.809 
to make sure that you're far enough wick
is<00:03:18.750> these<00:03:18.930> motors<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.319> going<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.560> spin<00:03:19.980> up<00:03:20.010> not

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
is these motors are going to spin up not

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.520 
is these motors are going to spin up not
fast<00:03:21.150> enough<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.690> take<00:03:21.900> off<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.379> they're

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
fast enough to take off but they're

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.720 
fast enough to take off but they're
going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.709> spin<00:03:23.069> up<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.430> you're<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.670> to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
going to spin up and you're going to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.920 
going to spin up and you're going to
you're<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.720> bit<00:03:24.900> of

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
you're going to have a little bit of

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.170 
you're going to have a little bit of
pressure<00:03:25.470> pushing<00:03:26.159> up<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.489> that<00:03:26.670> thing<00:03:26.730> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
pressure pushing up on that thing so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.270 
pressure pushing up on that thing so
make<00:03:27.930> sure<00:03:27.959> your<00:03:28.260> dogs<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.980> way<00:03:29.099> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
make sure your dogs out of the way and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.740 
make sure your dogs out of the way and
your<00:03:29.400> kids<00:03:29.670> aren't<00:03:30.000> close<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.599> got

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
your kids aren't close and you got

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.990 
your kids aren't close and you got
everything<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.470> know<00:03:31.950> ready<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.489> go<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.879> that

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
everything you know ready to go and that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.789 
everything you know ready to go and that
you<00:03:33.239> know<00:03:33.299> you've<00:03:33.569> got<00:03:33.599> lots<00:03:34.110> of<00:03:34.290> room<00:03:34.349> there's

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
you know you've got lots of room there's

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.380 
you know you've got lots of room there's
a<00:03:34.860> couple<00:03:35.040> different<00:03:35.220> ways<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.879> this<00:03:35.909> so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
a couple different ways to do this so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.440 
a couple different ways to do this so
this<00:03:36.659> is<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.049> do<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.379> in<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.280> down<00:03:38.760> you

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
this is the way I do it in and down you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.960 
this is the way I do it in and down you
could<00:03:39.599> also<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:40.049> it<00:03:40.080> down<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.860> over<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.730> way

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
could also do it down and over this way

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.100 
could also do it down and over this way
down<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.290> over<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:44.280> way<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:45.569> what<00:03:45.989> will

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
down and over this way so what will

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.990 
down and over this way so what will
happen<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.530> when<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.799> arm<00:03:47.159> it<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.760> go<00:03:47.879> like

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
happen is when I arm it and I go like

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.850 
happen is when I arm it and I go like
this<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.659> motors<00:03:48.959> are<00:03:49.049> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> spin<00:03:49.500> up<00:03:49.530> if

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
this the motors are going to spin up if

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.949 
this the motors are going to spin up if
I<00:03:50.010> don't<00:03:50.340> throttle<00:03:50.849> up<00:03:51.239> if<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.540> don't<00:03:51.720> use<00:03:51.930> my

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
I don't throttle up if I don't use my

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.929 
I don't throttle up if I don't use my
throttle<00:03:52.650> at<00:03:52.739> all<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.040> go<00:03:53.189> up<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.640> I<00:03:53.730> just

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
throttle at all to go up and I just

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.960 
throttle at all to go up and I just
leave<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.239> down<00:03:54.500> give<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.709> one<00:03:55.920> two<00:03:56.370> three

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
leave it down give it a one two three

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.550 
leave it down give it a one two three
second<00:03:57.390> count<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:57.989> motors<00:03:58.290> are<00:03:58.379> going<00:03:58.500> to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
second count the motors are going to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.619 
second count the motors are going to
turn<00:03:58.769> off<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.519> it's<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.700> safety<00:04:00.000> mode<00:04:00.360> if<00:04:00.510> you're

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
turn off so it's a safety mode if you're

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.899 
turn off so it's a safety mode if you're
not<00:04:00.810> going<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:01.349> ahead<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.620> fly<00:04:01.950> if<00:04:02.250> you

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
not going to go ahead and fly if you

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.000 
not going to go ahead and fly if you
want<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.269> disarm<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.019> you<00:04:04.140> fire<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.500> up<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.920> it

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
want to disarm it you fire it up and it

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.350 
want to disarm it you fire it up and it
starts<00:04:05.310> spinning<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.730> want<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:05.909> disarm<00:04:06.180> it

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
starts spinning you want to disarm it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.089 
starts spinning you want to disarm it
really<00:04:06.540> fast<00:04:06.720> do<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.200> again<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.860> that'll

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
really fast do that again and that'll

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.770 
really fast do that again and that'll
turn<00:04:08.400> them<00:04:08.580> off<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.120> I'll<00:04:09.299> get<00:04:09.450> your<00:04:09.599> motor

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
turn them off so I'll get your motor

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.820 
turn them off so I'll get your motor
shut<00:04:10.170> off<00:04:10.319> real<00:04:10.560> fast<00:04:12.170> go<00:04:13.170> ahead<00:04:13.439> and<00:04:13.560> turn

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
shut off real fast go ahead and turn

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.920 
shut off real fast go ahead and turn
that<00:04:14.099> up<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.939> it's<00:04:15.120> going<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.390> spinning

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
that up so it's going to be spinning

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.990 
that up so it's going to be spinning
right<00:04:16.139> there<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.739> put<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.250> throttle<00:04:17.519> up<00:04:17.790> just

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
right there you put the throttle up just

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.030 
right there you put the throttle up just
sorry<00:04:18.540> I'm<00:04:19.109> doing<00:04:19.259> this<00:04:19.380> backwards<00:04:19.620> with<00:04:19.949> the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
sorry I'm doing this backwards with the

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.979 
sorry I'm doing this backwards with the
throttle<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.519> back<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.359> little<00:04:21.389> tiny<00:04:21.840> bit

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
throttle it back just a little tiny bit

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.930 
throttle it back just a little tiny bit
you<00:04:22.560> don't<00:04:22.740> have<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:23.040> take<00:04:23.220> off<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.669> go<00:04:23.759> flying

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you don't have to take off and go flying

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.240 
you don't have to take off and go flying
just<00:04:24.870> put<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.350> up<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.590> little<00:04:25.770> bit<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.040> your

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
just put it up a little bit and your

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
just put it up a little bit and your
keep<00:04:26.460> spinning<00:04:26.820> so<00:04:27.180> they'll<00:04:27.360> keep<00:04:27.570> turning<00:04:28.050> if

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
keep spinning so they'll keep turning if

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.260 
keep spinning so they'll keep turning if
you<00:04:28.710> go<00:04:28.860> ahead<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.280> throttle<00:04:29.760> back<00:04:29.940> down

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you go ahead and throttle back down

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.000 
you go ahead and throttle back down
they're<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.690> continue<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.230> turn<00:04:31.620> for

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
they're going to continue to turn for

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.510 
they're going to continue to turn for
five<00:04:32.250> seconds<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.690> they<00:04:33.840> stopped<00:04:34.200> turning<00:04:34.650> but

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
five seconds so they stopped turning but

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550 
five seconds so they stopped turning but
you'll<00:04:35.670> have<00:04:35.880> five<00:04:36.210> seconds<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.870> get<00:04:37.380> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
you'll have five seconds to get the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.260 
you'll have five seconds to get the
throttle<00:04:37.980> back<00:04:38.160> up<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.760> them<00:04:38.880> turning

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
throttle back up and get them turning

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.360 
throttle back up and get them turning
again<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:39.750> if<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.930> want<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.200> land<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.800> flip

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
again so if you want to land and flip

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.400 
again so if you want to land and flip
the<00:04:41.520> flip<00:04:42.060> through<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.600> get<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> different

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
the flip through and get to a different

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.500 
the flip through and get to a different
mode<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.920> want<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.130> land<00:04:44.460> real<00:04:44.700> quick<00:04:44.940> go

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
mode if you want to land real quick go

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.840 
mode if you want to land real quick go
into<00:04:45.780> stable<00:04:46.140> mode<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:46.710> then<00:04:47.160> go<00:04:47.340> back<00:04:47.370> up<00:04:47.700> you

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
into stable mode and then go back up you

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.670 
into stable mode and then go back up you
can<00:04:47.970> usually<00:04:48.120> do<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.510> within<00:04:48.840> five<00:04:49.140> seconds

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
can usually do that within five seconds

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.860 
can usually do that within five seconds
if<00:04:49.890> you're<00:04:50.400> up<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.000> air<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.510> totally

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
if you're up in the air and you totally

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.140 
if you're up in the air and you totally
drop<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.350> throttle<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:53.010> got<00:04:53.430> five<00:04:53.670> seconds

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
drop the throttle you got five seconds

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.610 
drop the throttle you got five seconds
before<00:04:54.420> you're<00:04:54.630> going<00:04:54.750> to<00:04:54.810> hit<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:54.930> ground<00:04:55.200> it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
before you're going to hit the ground it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.960 
before you're going to hit the ground it
will<00:04:55.710> probably<00:04:55.920> be<00:04:56.040> in<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.460> ground<00:04:56.790> before

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
will probably be in the ground before

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.490 
will probably be in the ground before
the<00:04:57.240> five<00:04:57.390> seconds<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:57.900> up<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.350> could

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
the five seconds is up but you could

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.370 
the five seconds is up but you could
throttle<00:04:58.770> back<00:04:59.040> up<00:04:59.280> so<00:05:00.110> there's<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.169> lot<00:05:01.320> of

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
throttle back up so there's a lot of

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.100 
throttle back up so there's a lot of
safety<00:05:01.919> built<00:05:02.160> into<00:05:02.580> this<00:05:02.730> so<00:05:03.030> once<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:04.080> is

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
safety built into this so once it is

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.320 
safety built into this so once it is
sitting<00:05:04.650> on<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.919> ground<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.460> throttle<00:05:05.940> are

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
sitting on the ground the throttle are

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.150 
sitting on the ground the throttle are
sorry<00:05:06.810> two<00:05:06.900> throttles<00:05:07.169> down<00:05:07.530> for<00:05:07.980> five

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
sorry two throttles down for five

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.770 
sorry two throttles down for five
seconds<00:05:08.730> and<00:05:08.940> only<00:05:09.240> way<00:05:09.360> you're<00:05:09.480> going<00:05:09.570> to<00:05:09.630> get

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
seconds and only way you're going to get

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.870 
seconds and only way you're going to get
it<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.990> fly<00:05:10.200> again<00:05:10.350> is<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.800> rearm<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.700> motor

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
it to fly again is to rearm it the motor

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.840 
it to fly again is to rearm it the motor
starts<00:05:12.390> spending<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.810> same<00:05:12.960> thing<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.860> really
