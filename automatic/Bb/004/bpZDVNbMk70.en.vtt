00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.790
 hot water is like socks with them well 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.440
 and convenient 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.170
 in real life we â€‹â€‹are practically not 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.930
 pay attention to them 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.410
 but as soon as the socks disappear our lives 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.130
 turns into a string of complexity and 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.349
 disappointment coincidence don't think at all 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.689
 about the sock is nonsense but with hot water 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.160
 indeed everything is exactly so we 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.830
 don't think too often about 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.660
 Gratitude to the staff of thermal power plants for hot 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.840
 water but father Fedor Petrovich thank you 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.410
 washed but as soon as there is no hot water 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.910
 who will resist the temptation to call and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.379
 push but if it's a private house then 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.750
 hot water 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.000
 provided in any case well what 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 There are such devices as boilers 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 and today we look at the ariston boiler 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.920
 abs velis pw 80 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.570
 inside the bolero is the other two 40 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.159
 liter tank each equipped 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.080
 individual topics total nominal 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.210
 boiler power two and a half 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.799
 kilowatt advantage of two tanks in that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.720
 what if you used one tank 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.820
 hot water then the second tank will be waiting 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.950
 the next person in line is the bath and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 he will get another 40 liters of hot water 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.750
 they are barely warm and while one 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.430
 will use water from 2 to 1 will 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.289
 heat up again and then the third 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.509
 a person will get hot water of course not 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.520
 as hot as 1 2 is warmer than 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.340
 cold as if it were 1 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.420
 used on the side shorter two tank 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 in more is good 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.729
 ruler and PSV Alice in addition to 80 liter 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.890
 boilers there are still boilers with a volume of 30 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.049
 50 and 100 liters they all look 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.539
 equally disregarding the size difference 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.090
 cover the bottom of the case are made of plastic 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.920
 and the front side backs are made 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.840
 enameled steel in front is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.429
 a small control panel on which 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.960
 there are indicators of water heating 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.759
 control and adjustment buttons 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.319
 temperatures besides the standard mode 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.609
 heating function is provided here 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.950
 accelerated heating 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.410
 if in standard mode 80 liters of water 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.210
 maximum temperature of 80 degrees 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.130
 the boiler is heated for an hour and a half then 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.319
 FAS mode, it is done in 1 hour 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.940
 electronic control system and boiler 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.440
 do so not to deliver at all 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.200
 there are all necessary 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.180
 functions limiting heating temperature 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.040
 overheating protection and safety 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.930
 the valve still has the eco function and and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.990
 Manufacturers recommend including if 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.420
 you did not use the boiler for more than 3 days 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 not going to heat the water more than 70 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.200
 degrees which case does the boiler heat 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760
 water to the optimum temperature with 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.890
 optimal speed in order to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.960
 destroy all disease-causing and harmful 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.730
 bacteria that can live in stagnant 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.770
 warm water of the features is important 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.430
 note the presence of a protective device 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.600
 shutdowns 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.300
 i.e. in case of short circuit 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.640
 more just shut down don't expose u 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.320
 you risk electric shock safety it 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.180
 it is also important there is an active 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.840
 electrical drop protection 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.220
 stresses 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.410
 so in case of a power surge 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.300
 the boiler will also stay in order and not 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.870
 will need to spend a lot of money on repairs 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.670
 In general, ariston abs vls pw 80 is a boler with 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.950
 a set of all necessary functions for 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.870
 comfortable use both in the house so 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.060
 and in the apartment or in the country thanks that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.820
 watched subscribe to the comp channel to her 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.580
 like youtube like 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.080
 Great to make cold water warm 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.080
 it needs to be heated
