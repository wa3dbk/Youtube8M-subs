00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
some point Paul pulled me into his

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.360 
some point Paul pulled me into his
office<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> said<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> should<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> traitor

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so I can safely say that Paul is a big

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900 
so I can safely say that Paul is a big
proponent<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:49.129> women<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.430> been<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> great

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
is that there is a problem that there's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920 
is that there is a problem that there's
not<00:00:57.719> enough<00:00:58.289> women<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.760> roles<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.510> the

not enough women in these roles and the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.020

at they should start thinking about

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
at they should start thinking about
filling<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> pipeline<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.750> women<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.590> the

high<00:03:18.720> natural<00:03:18.900> gas<00:03:19.230> production<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.519> see<00:03:20.870> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
high natural gas production we see you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.319 
high natural gas production we see you
know<00:03:21.989> substitutes<00:03:22.680> away<00:03:23.130> from<00:03:23.519> cotton<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
know substitutes away from cotton and

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.509 
know substitutes away from cotton and
polyester<00:03:24.780> we<00:03:25.320> see<00:03:25.500> substitutes<00:03:25.950> away<00:03:26.160> from

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
polyester we see substitutes away from

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.539 
polyester we see substitutes away from
copper<00:03:27.120> into<00:03:27.690> plastics<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.489> a

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
copper into plastics and so there's a

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.550 
copper into plastics and so there's a
lot<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.730> opportunities<00:03:30.390> for<00:03:30.420> us<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.260> use

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
lot of opportunities for us to use

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.380 
lot of opportunities for us to use

technology to get away from being
resource<00:03:33.780> constrained<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> sounds<00:03:34.950> like

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
resource constrained so it sounds like

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.890 
resource constrained so it sounds like
that<00:03:35.489> how<00:03:36.150> you're<00:03:36.329> looking<00:03:36.630> for

that how you're looking for

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
prices right when we look at China we

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.140 
prices right when we look at China we

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
think about the the intensity of use and

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.849 
think about the the intensity of use and
when<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.390> think<00:03:51.570> about<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.079> last<00:03:52.290> decade<00:03:52.739> in

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
when you think about the last decade in

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.930 
when you think about the last decade in

days looking at water treatment looking
at<00:04:00.299> sewage<00:04:00.660> that's<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.989> much<00:04:01.170> different<00:04:01.470> usage

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
at sewage that's a much different usage

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.509 
at sewage that's a much different usage
of<00:04:03.470> commodities<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> goes<00:04:04.799> away<00:04:05.010> from<00:04:05.370> base

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
of commodities it goes away from base

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.520 
of commodities it goes away from base
metals<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.090> much<00:04:06.359> more<00:04:06.600> towards<00:04:06.959> cement<00:04:07.290> so

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
metals and much more towards cement so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.990

we<00:04:07.650> don't<00:04:07.799> think<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.820> think<00:04:08.880> people

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
we don't think that you think people

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.780 
we don't think that you think people
look<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.600> these<00:04:10.100> intensity<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.190> usage<00:04:11.489> charts

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
look at these intensity of usage charts

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.490 
look at these intensity of usage charts
and<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.180> think<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:12.959> going<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.320> go<00:04:13.380> on

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and just think that it's going to go on

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.810 
and just think that it's going to go on
forever<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.070> we've<00:04:14.190> seen<00:04:14.400> really

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
forever but we've seen really

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.949 
forever but we've seen really
significant<00:04:15.329> changes<00:04:15.630> in<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.930> underlying

significant changes in the underlying

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.349 
significant changes in the underlying

China

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
China

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.420 
China
is<00:04:24.630> now<00:04:24.870> targeting<00:04:24.930> seven<00:04:25.890> percent<00:04:26.220> growth

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
is now targeting seven percent growth

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.890 
is now targeting seven percent growth
but<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.850> seven<00:04:27.090> percent<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.480> what<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.720> needs

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
but the seven percent is what it needs

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.480 
but the seven percent is what it needs
to<00:04:28.110> double<00:04:28.350> per<00:04:29.100> capita<00:04:29.580> gdp<00:04:30.120> by<00:04:30.560> 2020<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.740> it

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
to double per capita gdp by 2020 and it

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.330 
to double per capita gdp by 2020 and it
has<00:04:32.700> been<00:04:33.110> about<00:04:34.110> ten<00:04:34.380> percent<00:04:34.530> last<00:04:34.980> couple

I<00:04:47.400> think<00:04:48.270> it's<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.420> statement<00:04:48.630> of<00:04:48.780> reality<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
I think it's a statement of reality I

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.750 
I think it's a statement of reality I
think<00:04:49.440> China's<00:04:49.770> China<00:04:50.250> is<00:04:50.400> going<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.670> be

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
think China's China is going to be

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.610 
think China's China is going to be
slowing<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.540> they<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.990> rein<00:04:52.200> in<00:04:52.470> the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
slowing I think they have to rein in the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.680 
slowing I think they have to rein in the
lending<00:04:53.010> dynamic<00:04:53.550> which<00:04:54.090> has<00:04:54.240> been<00:04:54.390> such<00:04:54.660> a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
lending dynamic which has been such a

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.630 
lending dynamic which has been such a
tremendous<00:04:55.050> driver<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.890> growth<00:04:56.040> so<00:04:56.340> they<00:04:56.460> have

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
tremendous driver of growth so they have

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.520 
tremendous driver of growth so they have
to<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.150> has<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.480> come<00:04:57.600> down<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:58.290> real

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
to you that has to come down the real

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.470 
to you that has to come down the real
estate<00:04:58.980> dynamic<00:04:59.520> which<00:04:59.700> was<00:04:59.850> such<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.150> big

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480

been is that already what commodities
markets<00:05:18.030> acknowledge<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.780> china<00:05:19.020> isn't

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.090 
going to grow at a rate of seven percent
or<00:05:21.060> more<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:21.780> part<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.230> it<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.410> think<00:05:22.560> when<00:05:23.010> you

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
or more it's part of it I think when you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.020 
or more it's part of it I think when you
looked<00:05:23.280> at<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.460> beginning<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:23.880> this<00:05:23.970> year

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
looked at the beginning of this year

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.150 
looked at the beginning of this year
people<00:05:24.480> were<00:05:24.540> still<00:05:24.810> looking<00:05:24.930> for<00:05:25.380> growth

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
people were still looking for growth

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.650 
people were still looking for growth
above<00:05:26.430> eight<00:05:26.670> percent<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.300> people<00:05:27.570> are

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
above eight percent so people are

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.920 
above eight percent so people are
ratcheting<00:05:28.560> down<00:05:28.620> slowly<00:05:29.190> their<00:05:29.550> Chinese

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
ratcheting down slowly their Chinese

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.510 
ratcheting down slowly their Chinese
forecast<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.050> don't<00:05:31.200> think<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:32.130> people<00:05:32.430> are

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
forecast I don't think really people are

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.690 
forecast I don't think really people are
much<00:05:32.700> below<00:05:33.030> seven<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.570> half<00:05:33.600> though<00:05:33.960> still

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
much below seven and a half though still

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.900 
much below seven and a half though still
but<00:05:35.700> i<00:05:35.730> think<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.030> commodities<00:05:36.660> are

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
but i think that commodities are

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.040 
but i think that commodities are
disengaged<00:05:38.910> from<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.330> overall<00:05:39.630> markets

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
disengaged from the overall markets

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.260 
disengaged from the overall markets
because<00:05:40.440> what's<00:05:40.830> driving<00:05:41.430> commodities<00:05:42.090> is

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
because what's driving commodities is

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.210 
because what's driving commodities is
not<00:05:42.480> liquidity<00:05:42.810> per<00:05:43.200> se<00:05:43.380> its<00:05:43.590> demand<00:05:43.950> and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
not liquidity per se its demand and

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.890 
not liquidity per se its demand and
demand<00:05:44.340> has<00:05:44.670> just<00:05:44.970> not<00:05:45.150> been<00:05:45.180> as<00:05:45.450> strong<00:05:45.540> as

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
demand has just not been as strong as

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.360 
demand has just not been as strong as
we've<00:05:46.140> seen<00:05:46.320> weaker<00:05:46.650> growth<00:05:46.800> in<00:05:46.980> Europe<00:05:47.100> and

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
we've seen weaker growth in Europe and

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.340 
we've seen weaker growth in Europe and
weaker<00:05:47.610> growth<00:05:47.760> in<00:05:47.970> China<00:05:48.180> whereas<00:05:48.870> asset

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
weaker growth in China whereas asset

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.050 
weaker growth in China whereas asset
markets<00:05:49.710> are<00:05:49.860> really<00:05:50.100> being<00:05:50.310> driven<00:05:50.640> in<00:05:51.000> a

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
markets are really being driven in a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.300 
markets are really being driven in a
large<00:05:51.240> part<00:05:51.510> to<00:05:51.720> liquidity<00:05:52.140> when<00:05:52.980> I<00:05:53.040> hear<00:05:53.280> you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
large part to liquidity when I hear you

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.700 
large part to liquidity when I hear you
say<00:05:53.400> tomb<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.600> asset<00:05:55.170> markets<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.560> think

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
say tomb and and asset markets I think

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.350 
say tomb and and asset markets I think
precious<00:05:56.040> metals<00:05:56.370> gold<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.850> silver<00:05:57.240> the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
precious metals gold and silver the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.270 
precious metals gold and silver the
shine<00:05:57.570> has<00:05:57.750> been<00:05:57.930> taken<00:05:58.710> off<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:58.890> these

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
shine has been taken off of these

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.150 
shine has been taken off of these
markets<00:05:59.790> lately<00:06:00.180> do<00:06:00.810> you<00:06:00.900> like<00:06:01.080> any<00:06:01.230> other<00:06:01.440> so

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
markets lately do you like any other so

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.070 
markets lately do you like any other so
we've<00:06:02.490> had<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:02.670> negative<00:06:02.940> view<00:06:03.300> on<00:06:03.630> precious

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
we've had a negative view on precious

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.650 
we've had a negative view on precious
metals<00:06:04.230> and<00:06:04.850> platinum<00:06:05.850> and<00:06:06.060> palladium<00:06:06.120> and

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
metals and platinum and palladium and

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.930 
metals and platinum and palladium and
the<00:06:06.840> reason<00:06:07.200> has<00:06:07.380> been<00:06:07.410> that<00:06:07.920> if<00:06:08.700> you're<00:06:08.910> a

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
the reason has been that if you're a

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.510 
the reason has been that if you're a
macro<00:06:09.510> investor<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.320> you're<00:06:10.530> sitting<00:06:11.490> there

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
macro investor and you're sitting there

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.540 
macro investor and you're sitting there
in<00:06:11.760> 2008<00:06:12.420> with<00:06:12.660> a<00:06:12.690> 5<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.140> 10<00:06:13.560> year<00:06:13.800> time<00:06:14.400> horizon

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
in 2008 with a 5 to 10 year time horizon

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.670 
in 2008 with a 5 to 10 year time horizon
you're<00:06:15.060> really<00:06:15.360> worried<00:06:15.630> about<00:06:15.720> asset<00:06:16.260> prices

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
you're really worried about asset prices

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.170 
you're really worried about asset prices
you're<00:06:16.860> worried<00:06:17.130> about<00:06:17.190> negative<00:06:17.700> yields<00:06:18.060> and

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
you're worried about negative yields and

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.980 
you're worried about negative yields and
you're<00:06:18.270> worried<00:06:18.480> about<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.780> dollar

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
you're worried about the dollar

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.690 
you're worried about the dollar
declining<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.160> at<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.370> point<00:06:20.430> it

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
declining and so at that point it

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.220 
declining and so at that point it
probably<00:06:20.730> made<00:06:21.270> sense<00:06:21.540> to<00:06:21.630> look<00:06:21.840> at<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.080> gold

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
probably made sense to look at the gold

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.860 
probably made sense to look at the gold
ETF<00:06:22.830> as<00:06:23.070> a<00:06:23.100> place<00:06:23.430> to<00:06:23.460> protect<00:06:24.000> your<00:06:24.360> capital

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
ETF as a place to protect your capital

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.630 
ETF as a place to protect your capital
but<00:06:25.290> you're<00:06:25.440> not<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:25.830> you're<00:06:26.190> not<00:06:26.280> going<00:06:26.580> to

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
but you're not you you're not going to

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.430 
but you're not you you're not going to
yield<00:06:26.790> there<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.750> price<00:06:27.960> has<00:06:28.080> actually

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
yield there and the price has actually

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.810 
yield there and the price has actually
been<00:06:28.560> declining<00:06:28.980> for<00:06:29.130> two<00:06:29.430> years<00:06:29.670> because

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
been declining for two years because

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.630 
been declining for two years because
gold<00:06:30.180> prices<00:06:30.420> topped<00:06:31.020> out<00:06:31.170> in<00:06:31.200> 2011<00:06:31.830> if<00:06:32.520> you're

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
gold prices topped out in 2011 if you're

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.990 
gold prices topped out in 2011 if you're
sitting<00:06:32.880> here<00:06:32.910> today<00:06:33.180> looking<00:06:33.600> at

as<00:07:05.200> I<00:07:05.290> can<00:07:05.440> ensure<00:07:05.740> we're<00:07:05.890> at<00:07:05.980> a<00:07:06.040> point<00:07:06.190> where

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
as I can ensure we're at a point where

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.040 
as I can ensure we're at a point where
it's<00:07:06.520> slowing<00:07:06.760> the<00:07:07.180> question<00:07:07.540> I<00:07:07.630> always<00:07:07.720> have

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
it's slowing the question I always have

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.960 
it's slowing the question I always have
though<00:07:08.290> is<00:07:08.470> people<00:07:09.190> to<00:07:09.250> us<00:07:09.340> all<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.580> time<00:07:09.760> so

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
though is people to us all the time so

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.760 
though is people to us all the time so
what<00:07:10.120> is<00:07:10.240> the<00:07:10.360> right<00:07:10.480> price<00:07:10.810> for<00:07:10.840> gold<00:07:11.110> and<00:07:11.680> I'm

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
what is the right price for gold and I'm

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.960 
what is the right price for gold and I'm
not<00:07:11.919> sure<00:07:11.950> what<00:07:12.190> that<00:07:12.220> is<00:07:12.430> I<00:07:12.580> know<00:07:12.640> that<00:07:12.910> you

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:12.970 
not sure what that is I know that you

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.340 
not sure what that is I know that you
don't<00:07:13.060> have<00:07:13.180> to<00:07:13.300> own<00:07:13.540> it<00:07:13.570> and<00:07:13.780> I<00:07:13.930> don't<00:07:14.020> I<00:07:14.290> don't

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
don't have to own it and I don't I don't

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.260 
don't have to own it and I don't I don't
have<00:07:14.680> to<00:07:14.770> own<00:07:14.860> it<00:07:14.890> so<00:07:15.040> my<00:07:15.250> funds<00:07:15.490> today<00:07:15.820> right

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
have to own it so my funds today right

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.030 
have to own it so my funds today right
so<00:07:16.780> we<00:07:16.960> look<00:07:17.140> at<00:07:17.230> everything<00:07:17.470> on<00:07:17.650> a<00:07:17.710> supply

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.040 
so we look at everything on a supply

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.620 
so we look at everything on a supply
demand<00:07:18.340> analysis<00:07:18.940> and<00:07:19.090> gold<00:07:19.240> is<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.450> one

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
demand analysis and gold is the one

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.420 
demand analysis and gold is the one
commodity<00:07:19.930> that<00:07:20.260> you<00:07:20.380> can't<00:07:20.650> model<00:07:21.100> that<00:07:21.310> way

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
commodity that you can't model that way

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.159 
commodity that you can't model that way
because<00:07:21.730> there<00:07:22.150> is<00:07:22.240> this<00:07:22.390> investor<00:07:22.840> base<00:07:22.960> that

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
because there is this investor base that

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.380 
because there is this investor base that
wants<00:07:23.350> to<00:07:23.440> hold<00:07:23.590> it<00:07:23.770> no<00:07:24.040> matter<00:07:24.190> what<00:07:24.490> and<00:07:24.760> so

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.390 
wants to hold it no matter what and so

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.140 
wants to hold it no matter what and so
but<00:07:25.840> you<00:07:26.110> know<00:07:26.140> but<00:07:26.380> we<00:07:26.470> think<00:07:26.680> that<00:07:26.800> the<00:07:27.520> fair

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
but you know but we think that the fair

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.880 
but you know but we think that the fair
value<00:07:28.540> on<00:07:28.660> a<00:07:28.690> supply<00:07:28.930> demand<00:07:29.140> analysis<00:07:29.740> in

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:29.890 
value on a supply demand analysis in

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.220 
value on a supply demand analysis in
gold<00:07:30.130> is<00:07:30.510> significantly<00:07:31.510> lower<00:07:31.720> here<00:07:32.050> and

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.230 
gold is significantly lower here and

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.930 
gold is significantly lower here and
you've<00:07:32.350> taken<00:07:32.470> 14<00:07:33.010> million<00:07:33.220> ounces<00:07:33.460> out<00:07:33.850> of

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
you've taken 14 million ounces out of

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.550 
you've taken 14 million ounces out of
the<00:07:34.030> global<00:07:34.360> gold<00:07:34.540> ETFs<00:07:35.050> right<00:07:35.260> now<00:07:35.380> but

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
the global gold ETFs right now but

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.470 
the global gold ETFs right now but
there's<00:07:35.740> still<00:07:35.860> 70<00:07:36.520> million<00:07:36.700> ounces<00:07:36.940> in<00:07:37.330> there

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480 
there's still 70 million ounces in there

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.500 
there's still 70 million ounces in there
and<00:07:37.660> those<00:07:38.470> 70<00:07:38.979> million<00:07:39.190> ounce<00:07:39.550> holders<00:07:40.180> have

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510 
and those 70 million ounce holders have

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.719 
and those 70 million ounce holders have
to<00:07:40.780> be<00:07:40.900> thinking<00:07:41.110> do<00:07:41.560> they<00:07:41.710> want<00:07:42.040> to<00:07:42.160> sit<00:07:42.550> here

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729 
to be thinking do they want to sit here

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.909 
to be thinking do they want to sit here
with<00:07:42.910> no<00:07:43.090> yield<00:07:43.390> going<00:07:43.870> forward<00:07:44.260> so<00:07:44.680> that's

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 
with no yield going forward so that's

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.469 
with no yield going forward so that's
significant<00:07:45.580> supply<00:07:45.850> that<00:07:46.060> could<00:07:46.180> come<00:07:46.330> back

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 
significant supply that could come back

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.960 
significant supply that could come back
to<00:07:46.600> the<00:07:46.660> market
