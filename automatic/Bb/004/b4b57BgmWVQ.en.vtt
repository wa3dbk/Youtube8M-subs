they're<00:00:43.020> worse<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.440> yeah<00:00:50.000> i<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.719> i<00:00:52.230> chant

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
they're worse here yeah i think i chant

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.910 
they're worse here yeah i think i chant
i<00:00:53.539> think<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:55.050> important<00:00:55.500> decision

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
i think it was very important decision

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
i think it was very important decision
to<00:00:56.160> stop<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> year-earlier<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.199> risk

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to stop the year-earlier kind of risk

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
to stop the year-earlier kind of risk
and<00:00:58.770> maybe<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.370> take<00:00:59.820> me<00:01:00.000> time<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.690> in

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
and maybe it will take me time to get in

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.219 
and maybe it will take me time to get in
this<00:01:01.710> year<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:02.820> get<00:01:03.000> matches<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.899> start

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this year to get matches and to start

this year to get matches and to start
playing<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.939> take<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
playing well it will take time and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600
