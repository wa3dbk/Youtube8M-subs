 female assistants to understand us 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 moira and natalia but let's focus now 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.239
 in metamorphosis although during the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.219
 hours that we have spent next to the two 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.140
 couples of protagonists we have already known 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.210
 more details on the authority over 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 colored bracelets on why 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 of the temporal gap between the experiences 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 of one couple and another and especially 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 about the importance of natalia and moira 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 in the plot of the game in metamorphosis it 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 they close many of the doubts 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.770
 to say all is well what ends well 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.740
 if this is a formation that is fulfilled 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.689
 at the end of a bombastic ending with 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 winks at the files of the series with a 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.860
 previous boss quite difficult and a boss 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.009
 final with which your will give the drop 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.360
 fat but to get to the end you have to 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 go through everything that offers 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.789
 metamorphosis like the previous ones each 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.610
 chapter offers two parts each with 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.560
 your partner corresponding the part of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.190
 klein and will die leaves quite 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 open-mouthed to the staff for its duration 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.679
 it's xs in less than 20 minutes we just 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 with this time trial part in which 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.039
 you have to kill a couple of bugs 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.990
 invisible and little more 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.090
 this part is too short for the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 weight that both have had during 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.069
 the adventure and with a development then 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.479
 some precipitate in its end that yes everything 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.259
 what they have to explain about these 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.060
 two weight is explained and finished 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.459
 of this episode falls on barry and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.560
 natalia your walk leads us through the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 aqueducts with toxic gas until reaching 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.150
 a mansion where the final part happens 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.040
 puzzles 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.049
 logical little ammunition paths 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.480
 labyrinths and narrow corridors in the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.340
 mansion good variety of situations and 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 tension in growing with a mapping 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.510
 quite interesting no doubt we are 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.989
 before the best part starring 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.010
 both in all reside level revelations 2 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.870
 as much as if we refer to the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.970
 full story as if we refer 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.790
 to the episode that closes the same 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.840
 the feeling is satisfactory and in 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.909
 general lines 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.310
 we see that capcom has managed to captivate us 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.430
 with tense situations creatures 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.319
 deformed puzzles and some survival yes and 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.989
 has lacked a bit more survival for 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.879
 return to the origins but we are before 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.879
 a highly recommended product
