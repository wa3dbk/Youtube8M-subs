00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.159 
fit my mood now i find that if you pick
up<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.709> very<00:03:50.010> wet<00:03:50.510> consistency<00:03:51.510> ball<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.109> you

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
up a very wet consistency ball and you

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.400 
up a very wet consistency ball and you
drop<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.739> here<00:03:53.099> i<00:03:53.389> find<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.810> fits<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
drop it in here i find that it fits the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.770 
drop it in here i find that it fits the
mold<00:03:55.739> better<00:03:56.099> so<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:56.879> really<00:03:57.359> want<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.599> make

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
mold better so you really want to make

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.559 
mold better so you really want to make
sure<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.139> bead<00:03:58.349> is<00:03:58.560> nice<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.579> wet<00:03:59.849> so<00:04:00.329> that

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
sure the bead is nice and wet so that

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.140 
sure the bead is nice and wet so that
way<00:04:00.780> when<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.169> insert<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.970> will

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
way when you insert it in here it will

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.920 
way when you insert it in here it will
just<00:04:03.200> flow<00:04:04.200> right<00:04:04.590> into<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.790> grooves<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.870> it

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
just flow right into the grooves so it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.949 
just flow right into the grooves so it
makes<00:04:07.169> it<00:04:07.319> easier<00:04:07.739> for<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.959> certainly

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
makes it easier for you to certainly

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.710 
makes it easier for you to certainly
fill<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.739> mold<00:04:11.129> up<00:04:11.370> really<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.269> easier<00:04:12.540> to

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
fill this mold up really it's easier to

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.180 
fill this mold up really it's easier to
work<00:04:12.840> with<00:04:12.900> as<00:04:13.109> well<00:04:13.230> or<00:04:13.470> beads<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.859> way<00:04:14.129> you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
work with as well or beads that way you

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.180 
work with as well or beads that way you
can<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.930> work<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.169> into<00:04:16.380> place<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.010> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
can just work it into place and the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.280 
can just work it into place and the
acrylic<00:04:17.789> doesn't<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.269> all<00:04:18.479> over<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.840> place

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.760 

you're<00:04:22.290> going<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.650> allow<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.460> dry<00:04:23.850> for<00:04:24.770> 30

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
you're going to allow this to dry for 30

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.880 
you're going to allow this to dry for 30
seconds<00:04:26.550> or<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:26.940> i<00:04:26.970> would<00:04:27.300> say<00:04:27.620> because<00:04:28.620> i<00:04:28.710> want

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
seconds or so i would say because i want

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.500 
seconds or so i would say because i want
it<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.010> be<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.220> little<00:04:29.460> bit<00:04:29.550> soft<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.420> way

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
it to be a little bit soft so that way

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.080 
it to be a little bit soft so that way
when<00:04:30.660> i<00:04:30.720> apply<00:04:31.140> it<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.500> my<00:04:31.530> finger<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.820> mold

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
when i apply it to my finger I can mold

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.540 
when i apply it to my finger I can mold
it<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.870> will<00:04:34.020> lay<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.590> out<00:04:34.740> nice<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.130> flat

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
it and it will lay it out nice and flat

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.390 
it and it will lay it out nice and flat
if<00:04:35.970> it's<00:04:36.420> too<00:04:36.750> dry<00:04:36.960> it'll<00:04:37.320> tend<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.800> lift<00:04:38.160> up
