like<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.440> old<00:02:34.680> root<00:02:35.190> ball<00:02:35.490> here<00:02:35.880> with<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
like this old root ball here with the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.320 
like this old root ball here with the
plant<00:02:36.560> okay<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.980> will<00:02:38.160> literally<00:02:38.519> kill<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.209> now

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
plant okay it will literally kill it now

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.930 
plant okay it will literally kill it now
here's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.600> couple<00:02:39.870> sprouts<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.730> with<00:02:41.850> that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
here's a couple sprouts but with that

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.750 
here's a couple sprouts but with that
black<00:02:42.239> plastic<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:43.080> there<00:02:43.410> when<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.070> Sun<00:02:44.430> hits

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
black plastic on there when the Sun hits

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.170 
black plastic on there when the Sun hits
it<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.260> kill<00:02:46.500> em<00:02:46.709> sprouts<00:02:47.180> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it it's going to kill em sprouts and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.540 
it it's going to kill em sprouts and
it's<00:02:48.630> also<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> help<00:02:49.410> kill<00:02:49.739> any<00:02:50.010> seeds

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
it's also going to help kill any seeds

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.840 
it's also going to help kill any seeds
that<00:02:51.390> might<00:02:51.720> be<00:02:51.959> within<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.950> know<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.489> upper

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that might be within you know the upper

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.479 
that might be within you know the upper
portion<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.570> pile<00:02:54.950> because<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.100> had<00:02:56.250> Sun

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
portion of the pile because we had Sun

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.680 
portion of the pile because we had Sun
hits<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.790> gets<00:02:57.090> extremely<00:02:57.480> hot<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:59.690> anyway

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
hits it gets extremely hot so anyway

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410 
hits it gets extremely hot so anyway
that's<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.130> couple<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.700> things<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.360> do

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's just a couple of things that I do

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.120 
that's just a couple of things that I do
but<00:03:03.780> there's<00:03:03.930> another<00:03:04.230> reason<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.769> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
but there's another reason for the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.430 
but there's another reason for the
plastic<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.690> case<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.260> get

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
plastic and that is just in case you get

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.820 
plastic and that is just in case you get
a<00:03:07.500> super<00:03:08.130> heavy<00:03:08.370> rainfall<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:10.290> might<00:03:10.500> want<00:03:10.769> to

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
a super heavy rainfall you might want to

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.150 
a super heavy rainfall you might want to
put<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.190> plastic<00:03:11.519> on<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.690> that

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
put that plastic on because see that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.699 
put that plastic on because see that
that<00:03:14.160> super<00:03:14.610> heavy<00:03:14.820> rain<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.260> leach

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
that super heavy rain is going to leach

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.530 
that super heavy rain is going to leach
the<00:03:16.980> nutrients<00:03:17.820> out<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.120> your<00:03:18.330> pile<00:03:18.840> okay<00:03:19.680> and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
the nutrients out of your pile okay and

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.840 
the nutrients out of your pile okay and
that's<00:03:21.540> one<00:03:21.870> thing<00:03:22.170> you<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:22.620> want<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.640> want

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
that's one thing you don't want you want

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
that's one thing you don't want you want
the<00:03:23.970> nutrients<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.660> stay<00:03:25.110> within<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.860> pile

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the nutrients to stay within this pile

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.050 
the nutrients to stay within this pile
until<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.660> utilize<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.560> see<00:03:29.000> so

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
until you utilize it you see so

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.880 
until you utilize it you see so
you<00:03:31.120> know<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.300> if<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.080> cover<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.590> with<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
you know you if you cover it with the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.339 
you know you if you cover it with the
black<00:03:33.099> plastic<00:03:33.450> during<00:03:34.450> his<00:03:34.599> summer<00:03:34.900> you're

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
black plastic during his summer you're

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.740 
black plastic during his summer you're
going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.620> kill<00:03:35.920> up<00:03:36.099> those<00:03:36.340> seeds<00:03:36.700> kill<00:03:37.569> off

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
going to kill up those seeds kill off

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to kill up those seeds kill off
