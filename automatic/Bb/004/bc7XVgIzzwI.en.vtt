00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.080
 very good friends of youtube 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.820
 welcome to a new video for me 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.460
 today I bring you a quick video 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.910
 How to revive a motorcycle when it is left 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.119
 dead due to lack of load here on the side 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 they will see that the steps are simple 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.470
 they will see here cost as I did them 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.360
 it is practically very easy what they have 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.370
 what to do is when you receive in the team 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 dead and not pledge are going to have to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.930
 to press the power button keep it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.110
 pressed and connect it to the stream 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 without releasing the button 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 minutes and a half minute the phone goes to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.010
 move to live the white led until 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.130
 garment and there they are going to let it load 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.200
 practically everything or 20% turn it on 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.360
 well for them to see that it works and what 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.670
 they keep charging and they will revive him there 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.140
 that phone had been sent to a 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 service and they had not been 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.160
 to walk had told him he had 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.320
 broken the tad to 8 they also made it was 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.300
 the plate that was soft problem but 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.870
 indeed the phone revived from 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.360
 that way 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 remember there are steps that say that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.440
 can do without connecting to the current 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.790
 but you do not have to connect it to the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 current they say has a system 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.830
 that keeps a minimum percentage of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 battery to make it start but to me 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.290
 I found it and here they are giving 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.780
 device as you can see 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.640
 without any inconvenience we 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.740
 we see in a very important next 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.470
 because when I learned it when I 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.380
 I managed to learn I stayed in the m 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.260
 motorola the world and did not load more in 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 Then I recommend that you make a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.840
 enter the recovery mode 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.860
 the recovery stop mode for those who do not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.689
 know let's show it let's pay it 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.870
 I'm left in the world and there was 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.640
 black 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.960
 do not be scared they have to do a very 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.940
 silver with factor and reset 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.680
 the two wood that has forgiveness the cache and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 the reset they will have 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.690
 Sheep and as follows 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 they press home and power and when they vibrate 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.620
 release power 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.739
 as you can see that is the recovery mode 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.629
 they move down with the volume and 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.329
 up on the ok and they will enter 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.329
 to recovery a flavor that this happens 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.600
 and there we have recovery we keep that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.600
 appear 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.390
 a little touch each one and press the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.120
 Volume buttons at the same time 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.530
 and will enter the recovery we address 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.870
 what 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.910
 all three at once sorry for a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.319
 volume up volume down and power and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.270
 there they are going to be 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.790
 the wing 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.830
 factors and the build has partitioned 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.180
 they were going to do the reboot and once 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.880
 do that the team is going to restart 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.830
 they're going to lose the data possibly in 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.300
 the space I had to do it I do not know if 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.950
 will happen with all the same but for the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.540
 doubts that the team that the black and not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.650
 vote they will have to do that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.000
 process 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.550
