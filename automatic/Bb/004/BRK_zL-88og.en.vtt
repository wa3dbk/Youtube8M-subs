00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.680 
workout guide so the first tip that I'll
give<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:11.280> workout<00:00:11.820> your<00:00:12.090> abdominals

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
give you is the workout your abdominals

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.690 
give you is the workout your abdominals
too<00:00:12.929> often<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.650> people<00:00:13.980> say<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.400> have

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
too often some people say that you have

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.480 
too often some people say that you have
to<00:00:14.820> workout<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.570> wrap<00:00:15.780> your<00:00:16.260> apps<00:00:16.529> each<00:00:17.160> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to workout to wrap your apps each and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
to workout to wrap your apps each and
every<00:00:17.789> day<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.260> shouldn't

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
every day but I think that you shouldn't

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.010 
every day but I think that you shouldn't
do<00:00:19.859> more<00:00:20.430> than<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:21.150> days<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.539> week<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
do more than three days a week and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.689 
do more than three days a week and
that's<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.470> absolute<00:00:22.619> maximum

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
that's the absolute maximum

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.630 
that's the absolute maximum
so<00:00:24.119> rather<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:25.769> abdominal

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so rather do one or two abdominal

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.240 
so rather do one or two abdominal
workouts<00:00:27.180> tip<00:00:27.810> 2<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> will<00:00:28.590> give<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.010> is

one<00:00:37.140> time<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> week<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.399> only<00:00:38.820> work<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.570> abs

5 minutes each week that's all keep the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
5 minutes each week that's all keep the
amount<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.620> repetitions<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
amount of repetitions that you do at the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
amount of repetitions that you do at the
same<00:00:46.079> rates<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
same rates that you would use for the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279

rest<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.360> body<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:48.989> your

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
rest of your body because your

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
rest of your body because your
abdominals<00:00:49.860> aren't<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> same<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.760> any

abdominals aren't just the same as any

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.139 
abdominals aren't just the same as any
other<00:00:51.120> muscle<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:51.870> body<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.399> about<00:00:53.730> 5

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
other muscle in your body so do about 5

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.380 
other muscle in your body so do about 5
to<00:00:54.510> 12<00:00:54.780> repetitions<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> stronger<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to 12 repetitions to get stronger and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.700 
to 12 repetitions to get stronger and
more<00:00:57.660> muscular<00:00:58.190> abdominals<00:01:00.320> well<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
more muscular abdominals well a lot of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.470 
more muscular abdominals well a lot of
you<00:01:01.859> still<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.850> only<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you still think is that you only have to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.020 
you still think is that you only have to
work<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.530> rectus<00:01:04.949> abdominis<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.790> can

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
work on the rectus abdominis which can

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450 
work on the rectus abdominis which can
be<00:01:06.330> worked<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.869> by<00:01:07.140> doing<00:01:07.500> crunches<00:01:07.799> hanging

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
be worked out by doing crunches hanging

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
be worked out by doing crunches hanging
leg<00:01:08.610> raises<00:01:08.939> stuff<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.840> naturally<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
leg raises stuff like that naturally you

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
leg raises stuff like that naturally you
will<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.340> focus<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.030> complete

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
will have to focus on your complete

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.679 
will have to focus on your complete
midsection<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.430> lower<00:01:14.729> back<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
midsection so also your lower back as

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.539 
midsection so also your lower back as
well<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.049> oblique<00:01:16.680> muscles<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> your

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
well as your oblique muscles and your

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
well as your oblique muscles and your
transfers<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.390> muscles<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.430> help

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
transfers as muscles so this will help

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.660 
transfers as muscles so this will help
you<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.390> stronger<00:01:21.990> overall<00:01:22.680> midsection

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you to get a stronger overall midsection

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
you to get a stronger overall midsection
and<00:01:23.820> bigger<00:01:24.509> abdominals<00:01:25.500> making<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> easier

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and bigger abdominals making it easier

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.990 
and bigger abdominals making it easier
for<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.479> those<00:01:27.689> six-pack<00:01:28.049> ABS
