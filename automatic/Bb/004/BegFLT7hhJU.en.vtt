00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 r 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.410
 or the granjilla is that such before anything 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.450
 extra extra has finally come out the version 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.460
 for adobe android lightroom mobile 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.820
 that until now was only available 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.740
 for apple devices type ipad iphone 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.960
 finally artifacts with them now too 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.310
 we will have it available on android but 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.810
 is not this the subject of the video so I 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.150
 I limit myself to saying what you know that in 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.039
 android we already have it and what 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.510
 yes I wanted to talk as I said before 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.879
 was first a couple of tricks for 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.410
 compare images and then see also 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.390
 how to do the same in bridge and 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.280
 take better advantage of the capabilities that we 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.050
 offers bridge starting with what 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.120
 lightroom you will remember from the previous video 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.940
 that if I select two images and I give 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.980
 AC see them side by side but I will 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.899
 clog the rest of the interface a lot 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.579
 Well, trick number one if I pulse 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.530
 tabulator the key that is on top of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.449
 block uppercase i can hide 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.149
 simultaneously the two panels 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.520
 lateral and with tabulator again what 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.260
 I recover if you want to hide all the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.420
 interface what I have to press is 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.660
 uppercase control efe or command 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.340
 capital letters i'm going to press it and how 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.080
 you see now I have all the space for 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.430
 compare the images come out 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.050
 partially from the window 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.300
 because I have changed the size to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.430
 press that key combination but it 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.440
 take advantage as I say much better 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.750
 space pulse control capital letters efe 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.310
 uppercase command df to return to the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.140
 configuration that I had before and I leave 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.150
 of the comparison mode and now we're going to 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 ask what happens if I would like 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.260
 Compare all the pictures at once 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.479
 unfortunately you can not do it anymore 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.880
 similar thing I can do is select 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.940
 the all come to poll key mode 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.860
 And here, I can hide the 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.020
 panels like I did before but I can not 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.050
 expand it is rather a way to go 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.270
 discarding photos and what looks good 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 you see how much more panel I eliminated because more 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.009
 I can see them big but it's a 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.720
 solution a little limited in this 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.700
 context may I find 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.320
 interesting to use bridge bridge has 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.259
 a lot of interesting functions 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.820
 although I must confess from the beginning that 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.440
 I never use it in the end because of course 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.330
 they would be lightroom and have to go to another 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.860
 program to do things that one 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.959
 I would like to be able to do directly here 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 It gives a bit of laziness but if 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.680
 we want to do is relatively simple 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.750
 I think the fastest way so 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 less in windows is first press 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.670
 control r or command 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.159
 to open the browser 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.409
 windows with the folder that contains the 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.830
 photos and now I do right button on this 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.140
 folder and I tell him to explore with adobe 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.879
 bridge or browser in adobe bridge and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.409
 This form opens the adobe bridge 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.840
 surely it will open here in the 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.239
 essential workspace that comes 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.129
 well by default that has a panel of 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.159
 preview rather small but if 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.959
 you come to the workspace preview 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.060
 you will have a much greater space when 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.970
 we are here I can click on a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.099
 picture and click on another one and now good for 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.220
 true one thing these are jpg if they were 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.500
 row be aware if you have marked or 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.359
 not this image because according to whether the brand 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.730
 are or you may use the preview 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.579
 embedded in the raw or that you use 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 the real interpretation of the role that is a 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.489
 little bit slower so attention to 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
 these two icons but going back to what 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.230
 I said if you select two images I can 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.359
 click here and this magnifier appears 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.030
 where I see it one hundred percent if I give it 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:22.000
 to the mouse wheel or to the widest to the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 200 and the 400 I think it is and if I move it 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 over here well I see 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.790
 parts and now I click on the part 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.040
 corresponding to the other photo 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.769
 I can compare and this goes great if 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.049
 I keep pressed control or command I can 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.329
 move the two magnifying glasses at the same time and also 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.819
 I can expand or reduce the 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.250
 simultaneously with control click quito 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.840
 the two magnifiers here unlike 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.750
 lightroom yes I can select more 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.959
 photographs for example 4 and I can go 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.879
 putting the magnifying glass is on each photo and 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.269
 well here I have almost no space left 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.189
 to put it and as you can see it is very 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.599
 practical to see which is the one that is 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.480
 sharper or the one with the focus 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.000
 better not only can I do this in 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.220
 bridge but I can also either 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.989
 selecting the photos I want or without 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 select none in which case I 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.319
 will take the entire folder but good here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.650
 well I'll leave like this with a 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.470
 selected I come to see and tell you mode 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.970
 review or review moat control sees and 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.280
 by giving it as there was only one picture 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.870
 selected has caught me the five that 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.580
 there is in the folder if I had done 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.009
 a preselection because I had caught 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.740
 only those here I have a kind of 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.840
 carousel if I want to see the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.259
 garlic that I can use here clicked the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.360
 h key and here we see that there is a series 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.099
 of options that will not entertain me 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410
 explain so as not to lengthen the video but 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.720
 good among other possibilities I can 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.120
 simply press the air to open the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.130
 image in raw camera is now going to open 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.289
 and here I could do something in fact I'm going to 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.400
 do one thing that will suit us for 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.009
 something I want to explain I'm going to 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.710
 convert this grayscale and you 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.630
 I say if I can make it look here you 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.550
 I say done just notice that you have 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.620
 open raw camera without opening photoshop 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.120
 this opens it independently 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.789
 which is going very well I made an adjustment 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.440
 fast here and it's worth as I say now 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.270
 I have five images, they do not fit all 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.650
 at the same time on the screen but in the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.210
 moment I eliminate one I'm going to 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.039
 delete for example is pressing the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.560
 down arrow key 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.300
 and you must indicate here somewhere arrow 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.310
 down remove from the selection or can I 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.340
 simply drag the image towards 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.930
 down now I already see four and the advantage 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.759
 that has good gets a bit out of the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.009
 window here I have recording 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.330
 more reduced and all this but you see more or 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.220
 except not the matter is that I have everything in 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.750
 my monitor with the four images and 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.450
 now I can in this 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.390
 review with four images then 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.310
 I can compare with the loupes these if 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.920
 I can control it to move them 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.750
 all at once and find what is the 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.300
 which is better to get out of here 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.650
 pressed the key is that I find that 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.630
 this was great even if it's a 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.100
 a little uncomfortable and uncomfortable to leave 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.230
 lightroom to come here wanted 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.910
 comment this saying that I was going to 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.690
 come well from this photo that happens white 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.000
 and black this picture is 10 10 554 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.450
 and now I come to the lightroom and what happens 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.240
 that clear this photo as you see here the 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.190
 10 554 here keeps coming out in color and 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.320
 Of course I would be interested if I 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.240
 whatever during the comparison I have 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.430
 any changes made from raw camera as 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.290
 I would like to see it in lightroom too 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.450
 no then there is no problem pulse 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.120
 right button I tell metadata read 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.770
 file metadata asks me what 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.870
 I say yes and now as you see 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.510
 he has automatically loaded me those 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.400
 metadata if I want to do it the other way around 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.750
 example I come to reveal we are going to 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.340
 wait for the module to change and 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.290
 Let's suppose 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.330
 I'm not going to give much contrast and I'm going 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.400
 to lower the blacks so you can see what 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.440
 I've done something that happens now 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.940
 I come to bridge this photo is still 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.100
 just like before I have to do to 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.680
 that happens in reverse then button 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.139
 right metadata save metadata in 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.760
 file or controls and you see goalkeeper 

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.639
 data now when I come to bridge and 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.400
 has been updated and I see the changes that 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.660
 I created in lightroom good because I 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.550
 I think there have been many emotions 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.800
 for a single day in lightroom mobile 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.930
 for android comparing images in 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.669
 bridge the almost frantic exchange of 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.590
 metadata so let's leave it like that 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.060
 simply thank as always 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.240
 have you seen the video wait for there to be 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.070
 been useful and say goodbye until next time 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.910
 input video or whatever thanks for 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.910
 be there and up to another
