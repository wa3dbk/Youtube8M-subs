and<00:01:49.460> as<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.850> company<00:01:51.240> grew<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.990> companies<00:01:52.979> do

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and as the company grew as companies do

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.240 
and as the company grew as companies do
they<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:55.380> brought<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.890> talented<00:01:56.189> people

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they we brought in more talented people

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.740 
they we brought in more talented people
and<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.119> diversified<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
and we diversified and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.260 
and we diversified and
directions<00:01:59.320> but<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.220> never<00:02:00.610> wanted<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.030> leave

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
directions but I never wanted to leave

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.380 
directions but I never wanted to leave
this<00:02:01.390> bed<00:02:01.570> better<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.100> achieve<00:02:03.580> 100<00:02:04.060> grew<00:02:04.620> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this bed better so as achieve 100 grew I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.029 
this bed better so as achieve 100 grew I
tried<00:02:07.390> my<00:02:07.660> best<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:08.080> keep<00:02:08.380> us<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.830> spare

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
tried my best to keep us in that spare

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.290 
tried my best to keep us in that spare
bedroom<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.520> we're<00:02:09.670> still<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.270> this

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
bedroom and we're still there to this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.800 
bedroom and we're still there to this
day

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
day

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.050 
day
it's<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.290> little<00:02:11.590> scary<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.220> me<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.760> we<00:02:12.940> now

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
it's a little scary to me that we now

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.150 
it's a little scary to me that we now
have<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:14.170> know<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.500> 11<00:02:14.860> or<00:02:14.950> 12

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
have I don't know like 11 or 12

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.449 
have I don't know like 11 or 12
employees<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.840> hired<00:02:16.990> two<00:02:17.140> today<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.190> I

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
employees we just hired two today and I

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.980 
employees we just hired two today and I
would<00:02:18.640> say<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.030> biggest<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
would say like the biggest the the the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.199 
would say like the biggest the the the
biggest<00:02:23.200> obstacle<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.370> achievement<00:02:24.730> growth

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
biggest obstacle to achievement growth

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.670 
biggest obstacle to achievement growth
has<00:02:25.420> been<00:02:25.450> me<00:02:25.690> mm-hm

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
has been me mm-hm

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
has been me mm-hm
we<00:02:26.950> could<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.190> probably<00:02:27.550> grown<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.850> lot

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
we could have probably grown a lot

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.360 
we could have probably grown a lot
faster<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:29.800> wasn't<00:02:29.980> comfortable

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
faster and I just wasn't comfortable

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
faster and I just wasn't comfortable
doing<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.820> yeah<00:02:31.000> it's<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.430> really

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
doing it yeah it's like it's a really

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.300 
doing it yeah it's like it's a really
amazing<00:02:35.020> thing<00:02:35.050> when<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.709> four<00:02:36.040> or<00:02:36.160> five

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
amazing thing when you get four or five

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.410 
amazing thing when you get four or five
or<00:02:36.430> six<00:02:36.610> people<00:02:36.820> together<00:02:36.910> that<00:02:37.180> have<00:02:37.300> this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
or six people together that have this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.610 
or six people together that have this
chemistry<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.489> just<00:02:39.760> works<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.510> we<00:02:41.410> had

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
chemistry that it just works and we had

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.590 
chemistry that it just works and we had
that<00:02:41.770> with<00:02:42.580> roosterteeth<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.360> never

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
that with roosterteeth and I never

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.240 
that with roosterteeth and I never
thought<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.050> us<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> second<00:02:45.160> that

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
thought in us for a second that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.460 
thought in us for a second that
lightning<00:02:45.580> could<00:02:45.670> strike<00:02:45.730> twice<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.510> somehow

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
lightning could strike twice and somehow

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.800 
lightning could strike twice and somehow
it<00:02:47.860> kind<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.580> naturally<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.510> aided<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
it kind of just naturally just aided to

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.110 
it kind of just naturally just aided to
achieve<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.230> hundred<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:50.560> created<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
achieve my hundred we created that that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.530 
achieve my hundred we created that that
uh<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:53.320> chemistry<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.340> am<00:02:54.520> terrified<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
uh that chemistry and I am terrified of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.229 
uh that chemistry and I am terrified of
screwing<00:02:55.720> with<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.100> am<00:02:57.280> very<00:02:57.760> slow

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
screwing with it right so I am very slow

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.040 
screwing with it right so I am very slow
to<00:02:58.300> hire<00:02:58.630> people

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
to hire people

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.240 
to hire people
Ryan<00:02:59.860> is<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.190> great<00:03:00.400> example<00:03:01.170> Ryan<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.500> lived<00:03:03.100> in

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
Ryan is a great example Ryan I lived in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.949 
Ryan is a great example Ryan I lived in
Corpus<00:03:03.580> Christi<00:03:03.610> four<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.570> half<00:03:04.600> hours

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
Corpus Christi four and a half hours

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.990 
Corpus Christi four and a half hours
south<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.320> here<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.650> made<00:03:06.250> him<00:03:06.370> drive<00:03:06.610> up<00:03:06.820> for

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
south of here I made him drive up for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.150 
south of here I made him drive up for
three<00:03:07.330> interviews<00:03:07.840> before<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.290> hired<00:03:08.560> him<00:03:08.739> and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
three interviews before I hired him and

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.150 
three interviews before I hired him and
then<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.790> wouldn't<00:03:10.560> he<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.860> just<00:03:11.980> kind<00:03:12.130> of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
then I wouldn't he really just kind of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.610 
then I wouldn't he really just kind of
worked<00:03:12.340> behind<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.549> scenes<00:03:12.610> for<00:03:12.910> over<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> year

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
worked behind the scenes for over a year

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.259 
worked behind the scenes for over a year
Rae<00:03:14.620> made<00:03:15.010> community<00:03:15.489> videos<00:03:15.760> for<00:03:15.910> three

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
Rae made community videos for three

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.520 
Rae made community videos for three
years<00:03:16.600> before<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.110> brought<00:03:17.290> him<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.470> board

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
years before we brought him on board

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.030 
years before we brought him on board
like<00:03:17.980> I'm<00:03:18.220> kind<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.120> jerk<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.690> guess<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.769> some

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
like I'm kind of a jerk I guess in some

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.070 
like I'm kind of a jerk I guess in some
respects<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.820> think<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.480> make<00:03:22.660> people<00:03:22.810> work<00:03:22.989> a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
respects I think I make people work a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.380 
respects I think I make people work a
lot<00:03:23.230> harder<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.739> get<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.519> get<00:03:24.640> hired<00:03:24.850> at<00:03:25.030> Shimer

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
lot harder to get to get hired at Shimer

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.060 
lot harder to get to get hired at Shimer
than<00:03:25.750> they<00:03:25.840> probably<00:03:25.959> should<00:03:26.440> they're<00:03:26.950> all

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
than they probably should they're all

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.990 
than they probably should they're all
incredibly<00:03:27.549> talented

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
incredibly talented

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.750 
incredibly talented
I<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.360> am<00:03:28.930> very<00:03:29.079> gun-shy<00:03:29.950> about<00:03:30.310> bringing<00:03:30.700> a

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
I just am very gun-shy about bringing a

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.340 
I just am very gun-shy about bringing a
new<00:03:30.910> person<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> new<00:03:31.570> entity<00:03:31.810> into<00:03:32.230> this

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
new person a new entity into this

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.560 
new person a new entity into this
dynamic<00:03:32.590> because<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.670> can't<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.269> can't

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
dynamic because it you can't you can't

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.880 
dynamic because it you can't you can't
bring<00:03:34.810> somebody<00:03:35.019> new<00:03:35.260> into<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.560> dynamic

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
bring somebody new into the dynamic

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.100 
bring somebody new into the dynamic
without<00:03:36.100> changing<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.549> but<00:03:37.000> then<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.989> know

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
without changing it but then you know

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.610 
without changing it but then you know
look<00:03:38.620> at<00:03:39.390> Ryan<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> best<00:03:40.959> example<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.410> me

intricate part and I realized and not
too<00:03:50.680> long<00:03:50.799> after<00:03:51.100> after<00:03:51.489> he<00:03:51.610> came<00:03:51.760> on<00:03:51.910> board

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940

and then Lindsay came on board that I
should<00:03:55.540> probably<00:03:55.750> not<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:57.070> commercially

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110
