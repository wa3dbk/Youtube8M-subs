00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.040 

just<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.820> outline<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.870> always

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
just do a little outline you can always

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.479 
just do a little outline you can always
race<00:00:55.070> and<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.730> isn't<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:58.280> what<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> do

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
race and like this isn't not what I do

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.980 
race and like this isn't not what I do
but<00:01:00.260> first<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.770> yep<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.969> head

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.800 

there's<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.260> outline<00:01:11.030> just<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> small<00:01:12.600> one

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
there's the outline just do a small one

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
there's the outline just do a small one
you<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.610> much<00:01:16.520> then<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.670> draw<00:01:22.280> two

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you don't need a much then you draw two

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:35.469 
you don't need a much then you draw two
eyes<00:01:27.439> kind<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> draw<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.130> triangles

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.999 

then<00:01:37.070> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.189> draw<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> things<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:43.259> nose<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
then kind of draw so things the nose is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:56.950 
then kind of draw so things the nose is
like<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.399> mushroom<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.250> careful

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:07.050 

I<00:01:58.990> think<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.229> good<00:02:01.540> race<00:02:02.540> any<00:02:02.900> problems

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.460 

that's<00:02:08.060> good<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:09.350> do<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.340> little<00:02:10.700> part

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.330 

that's<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.840> start<00:02:18.200> off<00:02:18.350> with<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:19.040> take

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
that's what you start off with that take

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.120 
that's what you start off with that take
a<00:02:19.370> little<00:02:19.670> dive<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:22.970> down<00:02:24.130> you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
a little dive in and so we go down you
