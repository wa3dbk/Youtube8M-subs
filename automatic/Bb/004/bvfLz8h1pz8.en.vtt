00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.640
 having come here to lay the first stone of the new pavilion of 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.539
 child education because I am convinced that it is great news 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.029
 for all the parents and for all the students of this school of the assumption 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.930
 I believe that the religious of the assumption have shown a great 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.680
 commitment to education 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.020
 of girls and then girls and boys 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.830
 and it is a commitment that the people of Madrid 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.640
 We want to recognize and we want to thank, I do it personally and then 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.650
 also on behalf of all Madrilenians as president of the 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.400
 community of madrid to all the religious of the assumption and to all 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.660
 teachers and teachers who have worked and work in this school 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.520
 and to demonstrate the technical quality of the school there is only one thing which is 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.150
 the number of children who demand of parents who demand that their children come 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 to this school every year are more even more than those who can admit i of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.840
 those that will fit when these infant classrooms are finished today are 1450 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.020
 students in primary school in compulsory secondary education and in 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.940
 baccalaureate and this makes this school one of the masters before this 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 wrong 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 and tell them that building nursery schools is very important today as well 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.520
 young families can reconcile can reconcile 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.950
 work life work 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 with family life knowing that they leave their children in very good hands 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.920
 in better hands than in the fabrics he directed those of the functions and in this 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 case directed by my friend Carmen Escribano is impossible very many 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 Thank you
