 still time for you to speak watch watch 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.490

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.370
 China 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.100
 way it becomes 100 and likes then know 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.930
 I do what is to come about 15 gio 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 what he suddenly said 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 found my video 15 times 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 like with 15 different account 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 but yes as a hundred and eight as me 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.190
 That 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.980
 yes if I then 14 waste of gio then 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.930
 remains in the 90 remaining 94 as me 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.790
 a quick calculate granny say but 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.110
 that is still morbid 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.940
 so I want that for you anyway 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.590
 and as I had announced 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.450
 probably a live stream tonight 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 at half past seven or not likely 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.840
 just at half past seven 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 but first we go the volume street 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.300
 play against team of the week with 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.050
 of course from Persie Gomez but also 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.940
 display 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.940
 really with the bag now with 4 he says I 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.130
 give you 34 place what a poland 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.820
 about power de leijer we are enjoying ourselves 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.260
 the ultimate play and I left immediately 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.540
 yes nice because here get a penalty 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.740
 against why after nobody knows 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.720
 you often 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.390
 violation of dung sack there immediately 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.340
 is he doing well for me? 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.290
 but like i said i got up tonight 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.380
 half past seven probably live streams 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.330
 between half past seven and eight and then move 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.040
 I put the link of my twitch that now in the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.750
 description if you are not already quite the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.920
 video is in the description 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.840
 you make it a goal , by the way 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.490
 because of the speed of per with bagging 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.620
 yes he is so incredibly fast 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.620
 He just got an upgrade from two 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.510
 speed of 32 after 34 delicious 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 I think in 2004 level to it 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.190
 Kweetnie certainly but it is something like that 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.450
 and you drive not yet use 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.370
 are p's and I use them again 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.400
 fantastic according to him according to me yes 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.950
 with small square and then introduced 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.110
 but live streaming at half past seven 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.180
 yes four things and here letter those skills 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.010
 real bags make you a great one 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.820
 switch flushes them had not seen 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.310
 travel 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.130
 to switch how high quality boy 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.870
 the one with soccer finally here 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.430
 also asks as a facebook 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.930
 guys so fast that again three times 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.360
 for she said three times square for 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.370
 it as a people game the fifth of the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.070
 from this episode if I'm right 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.720
 and we were already messed up with mertesacker 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.710
 and with the speed, they did great 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.810
 switch 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.100
 but here look penalty and yes if you are 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.120
 want faith or not 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.820
 yes fierce 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.229
 Tucker goes and takes and yes indeed 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.699
 him that way I walk it and so much 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.680
 criticism of him will have you times 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.630
 he beautifully shot the ball with a 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.190
 per mertesacker but not a minute behind 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.229
 6 not four against one 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.760
 and then finally the final score 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.410
 and yes that is nice 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.880
 I finally got 417 dogs I saw you 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.560
 your viewers always grows with drinking 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.300
 132 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.100
 but as we said 100 times so me 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.020
 in the description the 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.360
 the title or a the link to my 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.419
 twitch also hand and then we go to us 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.280
 package their open what i got and 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.300
 we hope for something very well just know yes 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.010
 I do a lot 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.740
 in shape image so but unfortunately we get it 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.539
 a top player called clean and green 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.400
 comes from the 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.320
 from south africa and we also have a thousand 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.729
 coins that kind of chill and silver 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.330
 contract in a bigger from me a bit 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.850
 times and put everything on it 150 200 and 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.800
 then occasionally something expensive I do 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.580
 man what i do n't know the prices so it 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.650
 will be fine 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.760
 I put probably schulte 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.500
 more expensive on my husband yes but ultimately 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.030
 so have the nice that package we go 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.520
 even those contracts indicate there blew 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.320
 and to moses i am going a good contract 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.389
 copy you can see my conditions here 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.810
 what names 9 go because i didn't know that 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.460
 That 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.160
 team of the week with competitions and such 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.840
 also metal before so this is 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.090
 then finally me the team and I am going now 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.680
 just as quickly buy contract anyway 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.669
 for a critical yes you can do that but me 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.690

 ramirez especially cage anyway martien anyway 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.120
 player and anyway because of the 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.520
 routing with condition is that much 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.410
 easier because the yes very much 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.090
