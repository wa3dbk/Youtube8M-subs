 more to my channel and today I bring you a video 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.679
 tutorial on how to edit spam 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.870
 our service minecraft I do this 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.610
 because a subscriber in my video from 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.330
 Minecraft construction avoid spam from 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.480
 server the truth is that I had planned 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.000
 a saga of how buildings and 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 others and spam came up to me I know why what 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.710
 I had dictated 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.200
 as I had said something, it came from 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.930
 say it equal to a subscriber the video 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.930
 could explain it well on your screen 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.079
 pc how to change spam finally i very 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.760
 Well, I'm going to do it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.820
 good, the first thing we have to do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.750
 to do is have 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.150
 the installed minecraft we download 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.080
 the server can be downloaded on the page 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.770
 of minecraft dot net and put the 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.770
 links later 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.010
 we download it on multiplayer server in 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.370
 minecraft server we download new 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.370
 downloads 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.369
 and once downloaded it will come out 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.320
 a servert banker and I already have it double 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.130
 click all these folders out 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.970
 such we give double click we get 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.970
 all these 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 let's see what happened to run 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.900
 this is the construction of our 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 server on our map 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.350
 and once this is done we see that in the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.689
 true 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 we close them when that when you do not 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.760
 creates 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.440
 we see that he created us this would be 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.590
 our map is worth 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.590
 of this folder would be on our map 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 predefined 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 what do we do now for what I'm going to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 to do is to get into the server first 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.060
 so you can see that he does not let me edit the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.060
 spawn area 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.750
 that's it 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 we achieve 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 pam pam pam 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.270
 and we see 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 students from here replace 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.120
 how is the spawn zone and it does not let us 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.370
 destroy nothing do not let us modify it 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.730
 or nothing at all 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.700
 what do we do we left the game 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.700
 and we close the server 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.549
 what you have to do what you have to do 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 father to be able to edit it our server 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.390
 what we have to do is copy this 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.740
 binder 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.550
 we copied the server folder and it's worth 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.990
 What we do is 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.980
 and execute 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.500
 app data 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.599
 sign of the percent high app 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.350
 percent in roaming and roll 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.590
 in the minecraft folder 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.360
 once here we get in 663 our 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.330
 Saved maps 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.910
 here we have new world net that you 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.540
 we paste our server folder on 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.489
 word vale 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.670
 because we paste here because this is 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.230
 our folder of six of a single 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.909
 player is valid that will allow us to edit 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.200
 completely our map when 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.200
 we close we go back to put 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.599
 we go back home 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.310
 but this time instead of getting into 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.050
 multiplayer we get into a player and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.050
 we have our word folder 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.209
 and you see that we appear in the same area 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.209
 only this time 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.890
 and we are left to give we will have to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.000
 do it on our maps 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.240
 preferably normal you look at 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.200
 commands we change to mode 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.200
 and creative 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.420
 for example I'm going to do here a 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.420
 bullshit 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.130
 fifteen 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.490
 and with this we become myself that I know 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.590
 silly here 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.800
 anyone for what is it that can be 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.800
 to be 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.720
 well once edited as we have 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.349
 wanted to do if in creative mode not what 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:52.099
 we do as we please we left 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.160
 to get out of the game we turn to 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.900
 put in 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.900
 afp data 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.189
 percent roaming minecraft in 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.729
 safe and copy the folder we copy 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:13.249
 other some we can copy or cut the 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.249
 we would like to copy it 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.640
 and we closed this point folder 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.300
 minecraft we do not go to the folder of 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.040
 our server 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.660
 but we can eliminate 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.520
 and we are going to paste this new 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.900
 Once this is done, we return to 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.900
 run our server 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.360
 it is put back to us this afternoon until 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.360
 that gives us gifts 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.780
 we get into them we go back to achieve the 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.780
 Minecraft 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.639
 login 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.500
 and we get into multiplayer of nothing 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.610
 and in multiplayer we will see that we have 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.610
 this edited but 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.460
 if we do not want to remove 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.540
 It does not let us 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.640
 OK 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.240
 we continue that in the server we continue without 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:14.700
 have it and this would be 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.760
 how could you dedicate 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.870
 our server in minecraft our zone 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.270
 of spam so you do not have to 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.090
 to be able to change the fix it 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:30.830
 much more beautiful and good I hope that you 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.800

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.130
