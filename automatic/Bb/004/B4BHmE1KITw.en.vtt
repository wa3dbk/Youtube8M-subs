00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.719
 hello and welcome to your graphic art yo 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.059
 I am Carlos and today we will be 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.650
 learning to create an animation like 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.680
 which you may be appreciating now 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.980
 same this animation 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.900
 is created thanks to the stroke effect 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.510
 in what would be adobe after 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.670
 effects I hope you like it and you stay 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.460
 to see the video here with me what if 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 we started with the video for this good 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.140
 Well, let's go to the new file 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.910
 a new project and here in the new 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 good project well let's go create 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.769
 a new composition and ours 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 composition new composition and here 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:51.329
 we will select a width of 1280 by 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.339
 a height of 721 a duration of 7 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 seconds or good and this is already 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.839
 criterion of you in my case is going to be 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 of 7 seconds if you want to do the same 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.680
 that as you are seeing it then you 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.260
 I recommend a duration of 7 seconds 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.450
 we will accept 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 and now very well let's go giving it says 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.950
 layer to layer again and doing tells 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.190
 solid we will select a color 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.660
 white and let's give in accept let's 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.170
 block this layer so that it is not us 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.020
 hinders in the future and we will use 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 the text tool with the font of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.230
 jelica stage hardwicke and we're going to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 write any text in this 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.630
 I will write again 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.430
 I'm going to make it a little bigger 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.820
 as of this size 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.860
 once this is done I will create a zoom 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.920
 with the magnifying glass tool something that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.780
 it would be the beginning of the cte 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.439
 with the pen tool we are going to 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 start to create a stroke of what 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.100
 I would come doing 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.960
 in the text 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.660
 eye because you have to have selected 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:17.410
 the text layer so that the stroke is 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.410
 generate us in this same layer ok 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.200
 once you have finished a good 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.660
 it will finish plotting what would come 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.959
 being a part of the letter 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.530
 we are going to press inkling control and a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.590
 click out 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.580
 so you can continue to trace 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.580
 the rest of the letter 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.860
 What if I am going to put a pause 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.290
 what would this video be doing to 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.590
 that it does not take us long 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.379
 the duration of the video ok so in a 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 second we return very well here had 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.590
 finished tracing everything that would come 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.100
 being the text once this is finished 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 let's go to effect generate strokes 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.560
 and here in the general stroke effect 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.080
 so let's change the color to a color 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.700
 other than the background or the text in 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.100
 this case I will select a color 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.770
 red we will accept and we will 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.960
 change the size of the brush to one that 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.810
 cover us more or less what would come 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.410
 being the text in this case we can 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.240
 be appreciating and here only you 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.640
 applies the stroke effect in what 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.680
 it would be a single mask 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.210
 so that it does not apply to us in all 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.220
 masks well then let's mark what 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.470
 that would be this box that says 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.030
 to all the masks so we already know 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 applies in what would be all the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.220
 text let's create a zoom here in the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.770
 parts that look black that look 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.220
 free 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.940
 well and we're going to be covering what 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.430
 what would it be 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.850
 the color red or the color that you 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.850
 have chosen 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.050
 we have to correct these errors here 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 for what 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 do not go wrong the animation ok 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.409
 very well here and we only need to fix 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.409
 What I would do 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.190
 well here I will increase a little more 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.110
 the size of the brush 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.750
 in what would be a new one for 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.270
 hundred and well here we have already covering 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.270
 all the black parts that were left over 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:11.440
 and well let's change it 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.300
 or if a 9 is fine here the size of the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.990
 brush would lead to 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.990
 at your discretion 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.860
 the end of the brush size is so that 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.150
 cover all the text that does not fit 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.069
 any text any outside edge 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.659
 now well where it says style of 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.449
 paint let's change it and let's 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:35.080
 select reveal original image a 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.710
 Once this is done we are going to go where 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.060
 says end let's dial the stopwatch and 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.370
 we are going to change it in 0% 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.580
 we're going to have to dial the stopwatch 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.520
 in the position that we want 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.990
 will start in our animation in this 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.490
 case I have placed it at 0 0 in the 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.280
 minute number 0 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.200
 to say so 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.200
 then now very well we are going to 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.730
 to advance this 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.419
 insurance that we believe that 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.449
 I finished animation in this case I go 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:16.689
 to select the second number 4 and 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.819
 we are going to mark 100% in equally in 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.969
 order once this is done we have 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.139
 our animation made 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.960
 let's now see a preview 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.580
 and here we have the text is already going 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.759
 writing here we have a few 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.189
 mistakes by the brush but this can be 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.819
 arrange to resize or modify 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.819
 the stroke 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.300
 well now where it ends our 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.270
 innovation we are going to place the marker and 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.250
 we are going to create a new text this text 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.230
 I'm going to change it to a size of 100 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:54.270
 one hundred or so 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.270
 and I will serve for Carlos 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:01.069
 here the text so that it is a bit 

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:01.069
 small 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.150
 well we're going we're going to do a little more 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.150
 large to a 200 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.090
 I'm going to put it here and let's go 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:17.000
 mark let's select the layer of the 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.650
 secondary text we're going to click on 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.830
 this little arrow to show us 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.380
 these options we are going to deploy the 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.450
 option to transform I do not even want to say 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.600
 opacity let's change the percent to 

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.700
 0% we will dial the stopwatch and 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.430
 let's move forward a second in this 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:37.570
 case would be in the second number 5 we're going 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:41.660
 to now re-modify where 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:44.110
 we had modified opacity and now what 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.060
 let's change to 100 percent 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.280
 and well we would have ready our 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:52.450
 full animation 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:56.470
 here we have the animation of the text 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:58.560
 main thing that we wanted to highlight more 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.060
 and the secondary text that is appearing 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.310
 my name is Carlos, I hope that I have 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:06.720
 liked this video tutorial we are in 

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.720
 a next video goodbye
