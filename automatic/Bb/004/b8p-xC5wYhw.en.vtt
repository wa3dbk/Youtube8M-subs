00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.440
 hello friends how about this time 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.610
 I want to show this brand team 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.039
 The model is the ub 809 or if they want 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.160
 look for it as place 2 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.970
 As you can see, the team brings 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.399
 an analogous tv version 4.2 of android 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.929
 a 3 megapixel camera and in the 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.790
 back side tells you in the colors 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.160
 that is available that are 6 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.079
 well this team I found it in a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 price of 1350 pesos with the distributor 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.760
 I do not know when it comes directly in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.879
 a 3rd store 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.609
 and this to make a small reference 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.739
 has little left the team and I say I'm 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.809
 recording the video precisely in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.969
 December 2013 hours and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.589
 Later they want to know more things 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.989
 the reference of how long the 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.810
 team or what is going to show you what 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.650
 have the box 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.470
 as you can see here is the team 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.340
 because I show them the content well 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.340
 of the same 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 the data cable with the connector 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.610
 current in the equipment 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.010
 a hands-free 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 and finally 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.390
 here is the user manual 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.330
 OK fine 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.090
 let me show you the team and here as 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.540
 you can see it's still on your label 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.470
 you can see them make the review that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.510
 has television but before analogous 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.360
 has a dual-core processor to 12 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.190
 or 1.3 giga hertz a camera of 3 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.750
 megapixels the screen is 4 inches 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.330
 and in the 4.2 version of the android 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 to see the size of the team here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.850
 they put it a little bit better and I will 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.550
 a compassion a comparison forgiveness 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.600
 with the iPhone5 see the size of one and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.820
 of other 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.720
 I usually for the price that I 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.050
 I found this one 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.690
 this team is not the teams are 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.180
 more boys are 3 inches or 3.5 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.950
 inches but this is 4 inches in 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.190
 the size of between one and another 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.190
 okay 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.480
 this is the hue or purple color for 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.480
 that they realize 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.200
 you see a plastic a little more this more 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.470
 resistant is not so so flimsy the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.630
 audio control the input of hearing aids 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.150
 the ignition and the data or load 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 current precisely and precisely if 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.920
 You can also see the camera 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.920
 with the small led that includes 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.990
 good this simple the team blazer 2 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.910
 later I will show you precisely 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.270
 in another video the operation of the 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.540
 same 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.670
 and using some applications of 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.379
 of how precisely it works in both 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.480
 the screen the internal characteristics 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.390
 of the team that takes so long to open 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.799
 an application and why do they go a little 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.230
 more also screen resolution I say 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.280
 several aspects I will show you right now 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.260
 it was just a quick inbox of what 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.480
 that this contains the box with the equipment 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.720
 good to see in the next video up 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.720
 soon
