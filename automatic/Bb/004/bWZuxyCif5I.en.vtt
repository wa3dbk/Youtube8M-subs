 the peculiarity of these shoes. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 the presence of the history of crying 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720

 penis as I am now sick 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.299
 I decide when 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.789
 the right time for you 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.019
 catering tighten the right opportunity to wear them 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.659

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.949
 very hot though 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.489
 normal to pretend that we risk not being able to wear them at least once 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.479
 free notation reserve us special term papers then decided to 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.939
 villa san michele 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.549
 knowing that I should walk a lot 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 in fact my feet resisted for a while 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.649

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.999

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.999
 this is to say beautiful songs suitable shoes 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.129
 if they are not shoes that can be worn as one must walk 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 a lot when it is necessary to stand for a long time 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.969
 then nothing . 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.829
 last purchase 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.289

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.729
 I'm glad as usual to know what you think of this track then 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.319
 you are free to write in this video to write what 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.279
 think of it 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:48.419
 Having said that I wanted to tell you another thing you are thinking of me reading 2 books 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.189
 on etiquette 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:56.999
 % for those two and three who didn't know what console is etiquette 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.239
 events evenings or contains 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.589
 of the rules 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:05.149
 not allowing us to be able to behave in the right way 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.589
 and i'm all situations in various situations 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.600
 so it seemed like a nice idea 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.719
 being able to share with you what I'm reading 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.640
 and therefore innes what I will learn from this from these two books on Italy 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.800
 m 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.690
 I would like to know from you if you are also interested in the fascists in the face of the videos 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.559
 m 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:36.219
 suriano on the etiquette precisely is if you are interested in what topics in 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:41.340
 Particularly explicit arguments are practically vast air 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.610
 rn 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.020
 to give an example and for you to suggest we say you could tell me this 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.129
 topic 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.819
 michelin routes 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.740
 from the director tells me what it means 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.399
 sending comments can be, for example, how to set the table 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.689
 the situation 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:59.840
 informal 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.880

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.980
 how to make a breastfeed for him and her 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.830
 or again 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.479
 gifts as dogs are accepted as gifts are rejected 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.800
 if anything, you would have to find the space to have to refuse a boy 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.020
 and therefore nothing and not only 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.030
 arguments other two people wounded city or 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.889

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.889
 you are a curiosity 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.539
 regarding punctual etiquette what the etiquette on a particular topic says 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.150

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.960
 it is not a problem that does for me what I will learn 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.210

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.190
