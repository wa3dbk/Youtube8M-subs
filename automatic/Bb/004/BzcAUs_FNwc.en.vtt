00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the moment we don't want that let's say

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.570 
the moment we don't want that let's say
move<00:02:15.659> it<00:02:15.840> back<00:02:16.049> up<00:02:16.319> ever<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.010> slightly<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
move it back up ever so slightly and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.460 
move it back up ever so slightly and
obviously<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.599> if<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> actually<00:02:19.170> know<00:02:19.290> like

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
obviously and if you actually know like

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.840 
obviously and if you actually know like
the<00:02:19.620> hexadecimal<00:02:19.980> called

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
the hexadecimal called

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.430 
the hexadecimal called
like<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> specific<00:02:21.570> color<00:02:21.780> then<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.200> could

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
like a specific color then you could

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440 
like a specific color then you could
just<00:02:22.470> input<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.040> he<00:02:23.190> ever<00:02:23.370> as<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.640> see<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.300> can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
just input it he ever as you see you can

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.880 
just input it he ever as you see you can
change<00:02:24.630> these<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.140> whatever<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.740> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
change these to be whatever you want and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.580 
change these to be whatever you want and
if<00:02:25.980> we<00:02:26.100> go<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> edit<00:02:26.880> add<00:02:27.030> 10<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.720> then<00:02:28.350> it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
if we go to edit add 10 to then it

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
if we go to edit add 10 to then it
changes<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.190> sort<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.730> different<00:02:30.120> part<00:02:30.330> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
changes a sort of a different part of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.660 
changes a sort of a different part of
the<00:02:30.660> tail<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.710> go<00:02:31.860> down<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.490> see

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the tail so if we go down here you see

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
the tail so if we go down here you see
that<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.060> changes<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> top<00:02:33.780> half<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.260> and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that it changes the top half of it and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.990 
that it changes the top half of it and
this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.800> basically<00:02:35.070> done<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.490> create<00:02:35.640> sort<00:02:35.970> of

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
this is basically done to create sort of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
this is basically done to create sort of
like<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.210> gradient<00:02:36.660> between<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.320> tint<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
like a gradient between a tint one and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.830 
like a gradient between a tint one and
ten<00:02:38.580> two<00:02:38.820> sides<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.210> can<00:02:39.270> see<00:02:39.330> we've<00:02:39.510> got<00:02:39.540> red

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
ten two sides you can see we've got red

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.750 
ten two sides you can see we've got red
up<00:02:39.960> here<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.350> then<00:02:40.440> nice<00:02:40.650> green<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
up here and then nice green down on the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.840 
up here and then nice green down on the
bottom<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.210> then<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.960> ten<00:02:43.350> three<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.040> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
bottom and then at ten three is just the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.550 
bottom and then at ten three is just the
tip<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> tail<00:02:45.720> which<00:02:45.990> sounds<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.410> little

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
tip of the tail which sounds a little

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
tip of the tail which sounds a little
bit<00:02:46.740> weird<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.220> adjust<00:02:47.610> these<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.210> can<00:02:48.330> see

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
bit weird if we adjust these you can see

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
bit weird if we adjust these you can see
that<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.690> can<00:02:48.930> have<00:02:48.960> like<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> nice<00:02:49.860> white<00:02:50.070> one<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
that I can have like a nice white one it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.010 
that I can have like a nice white one it
kind<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.640> looks<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.880> bit<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> tic

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
kind of looks a bit like a like a tic

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.390 
kind of looks a bit like a like a tic
tac<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.410> moment<00:02:52.710> or<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.920> might<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.310> be

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
tac at the moment or that might just be

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400 
tac at the moment or that might just be
