00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.750 

not<00:00:49.110> done<00:00:49.350> yet<00:00:49.379> though<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> go

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
not done yet though we still have to go

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:03.950 
not done yet though we still have to go
from<00:00:51.149> fat<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:56.449> next<00:00:57.449> priority<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:02.960> get

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
from fat so next priority is also to get

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.380 
from fat so next priority is also to get
a<00:01:04.019> support<00:01:04.439> station<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:11.090> up<00:01:12.090> great<00:01:12.570> thank<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
a support station up up great thank you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
a support station up up great thank you
smalls<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.600> hair<00:01:15.810> super<00:01:16.170> teleport<00:01:22.369> we're

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
we're going to open up this cave good

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.440 
we're going to open up this cave good
job<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.689> yourself<00:01:45.990> killed<00:01:50.450> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
job you know I got yourself killed you

job you know I got yourself killed you
can<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.810> quite<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> few<00:01:52.229> energy<00:01:52.530> crystals<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can see quite a few energy crystals in

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.530 
can see quite a few energy crystals in
this<00:01:53.130> area

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.580 

this<00:02:01.540> we're<00:02:01.720> gonna<00:02:01.810> do<00:02:02.050> get<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> energy

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
this we're gonna do get the energy

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:13.560 
this we're gonna do get the energy
crystals<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.700> out<00:02:08.400> not<00:02:09.400> at<00:02:09.520> all<00:02:09.670> portable<00:02:12.570> you

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
crystals get out not at all portable you

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.700 
crystals get out not at all portable you
guys<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.860> damaged<00:02:15.250> crisis<00:02:19.410> quickly<00:02:20.410> we<00:02:20.530> don't

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
guys get damaged crisis quickly we don't

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:57.840 
guys get damaged crisis quickly we don't
have<00:02:21.540> whoops<00:02:22.540> time<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.830> waste<00:02:24.130> Oh<00:02:38.040> take<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
have whoops time to waste Oh take it the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.070 
have whoops time to waste Oh take it the
organic<00:02:58.420> crystal<00:03:02.190> again<00:03:03.190> forget<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.390> or<00:03:04.510> get

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
organic crystal again forget the or get

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:35.760 
organic crystal again forget the or get
the<00:03:05.260> energy<00:03:05.620> crystals<00:03:32.820> see<00:03:33.820> oh<00:03:34.470> great<00:03:35.470> that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
the energy crystals see oh great that

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.190 
the energy crystals see oh great that
and<00:03:36.280> upgrade<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:39.180> that's<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.630> need<00:03:40.930> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200

I'm going to keep that on a line just
because<00:03:47.670> many<00:03:48.670> energy<00:03:48.970> crystals<00:03:49.390> in<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.600> area

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
because many energy crystals in the area

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.150 
because many energy crystals in the area
of<00:03:52.720> course<00:03:53.080> after<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.890> too<00:03:54.100> is<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.280> goner

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.360 

this<00:07:16.070> cave<00:07:16.580> is<00:07:16.610> dead<00:07:17.320> that<00:07:18.320> is<00:07:18.860> part<00:07:19.220> of<00:07:19.280> it

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
this cave is dead that is part of it

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:26.800 
this cave is dead that is part of it
actually<00:07:20.710> okay<00:07:21.710> that's<00:07:21.980> back<00:07:22.160> online<00:07:23.740> so<00:07:24.740> I'm
