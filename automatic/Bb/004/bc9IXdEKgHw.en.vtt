00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
shed or the other geckos I think Melo

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.340 
shed or the other geckos I think Melo
when<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.000> turn<00:04:52.270> on<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.450> lights<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:53.110> change

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
when I turn on the lights to change

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.900 
when I turn on the lights to change
their<00:04:53.560> food<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:53.890> water<00:04:54.040> just<00:04:54.430> somebody<00:04:54.670> to<00:04:54.790> go

I think he was trying to eat the part on
her<00:04:56.920> neck<00:04:57.130> because<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:57.910> considered<00:04:58.240> extra

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
her neck because it is considered extra

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.120 
her neck because it is considered extra
nutrients<00:04:59.320> so<00:04:59.770> they<00:05:00.520> will<00:05:00.760> indeed<00:05:01.180> uh<00:05:01.920> eat<00:05:02.920> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130
