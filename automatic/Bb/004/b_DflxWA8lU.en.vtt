handling the lodge let me tell you my
straight<00:01:31.409> carbon<00:01:31.799> steel<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.219> specialty<00:01:32.700> these

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
straight carbon steel is specialty these

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.749 
straight carbon steel is specialty these
knives<00:01:33.749> are<00:01:33.960> made<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.289> very<00:01:34.679> simple<00:01:35.249> material

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
knives are made of very simple material

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
knives are made of very simple material
it's<00:01:35.999> iron<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.749> carbon<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:38.039> because<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it's iron and carbon but because it's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.789 
it's iron and carbon but because it's
only<00:01:38.819> those<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.210> elements<00:01:39.719> it<00:01:39.960> has<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> really

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
only those two elements it has a really

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
only those two elements it has a really
fine<00:01:41.249> grain<00:01:41.609> structure<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.600> takes<00:01:42.810> an

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
fine grain structure so it takes an

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770 
fine grain structure so it takes an
incredibly<00:01:43.710> sharp<00:01:44.069> edge<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.569> they

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
incredibly sharp edge it's because they

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
incredibly sharp edge it's because they
take<00:01:45.990> such<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.289> keen<00:01:46.619> edge<00:01:46.859> it's<00:01:47.189> because

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
take such a keen edge it's because

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.749 
take such a keen edge it's because
they're<00:01:47.999> so<00:01:48.179> easy<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> sharpen<00:01:48.929> that<00:01:49.770> makes

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
they're so easy to sharpen that makes

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.239 
they're so easy to sharpen that makes
straight<00:01:51.119> carbon<00:01:51.509> steel<00:01:51.719> so<00:01:51.960> special<00:01:52.469> over

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
straight carbon steel so special over

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.289 
straight carbon steel so special over
time<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.670> will<00:01:53.759> start<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.210> this
