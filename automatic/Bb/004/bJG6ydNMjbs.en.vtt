through the door and get to a point

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.890 
through the door and get to a point
where<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.920> ways<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.570> that<00:01:24.570> entire

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
get outside the door and we're going

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.800 
get outside the door and we're going
down<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.340> corridor<00:01:38.820> toward<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.270> exit<00:01:39.659> at

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
common path a travel distance we must

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
common path a travel distance we must
continue<00:01:46.890> till<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.970> choice<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.750> two

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
continue till we have a choice of two

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
continue till we have a choice of two
ways<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.880> point<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.930> entire<00:01:52.350> path<00:01:52.799> from

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
down the corridor to here must be less

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.450 
down the corridor to here must be less
than<00:01:59.369> 75<00:02:00.360> feet<00:02:00.659> keep<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> mind<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.950> better

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
than 75 feet keep in mind a better

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
than 75 feet keep in mind a better
location<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> door<00:02:03.899> may<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.439> appropriate

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
location of the door may be appropriate

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.660 
location of the door may be appropriate
so<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.360> our<00:02:06.630> common<00:02:07.259> path<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.710> travel<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.640> be

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so that our common path of travel can be

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.830 
so that our common path of travel can be
maintained<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:09.720> achieved

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
maintained or achieved

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.350 
maintained or achieved
now<00:02:11.530> let's<00:02:11.830> look<00:02:12.069> at<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.760> other<00:02:12.940> piece<00:02:13.330> of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
now let's look at the other piece of

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.760 
now let's look at the other piece of
this<00:02:13.690> dead<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.900> location<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.260> could

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
this dead in this location here could

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.820
