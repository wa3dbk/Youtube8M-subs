tendonitis rotator cuff issues things

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
tendonitis rotator cuff issues things
like<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.039> mean<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.550> seems<00:00:59.760> obvious<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like that I mean it seems obvious but I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
like that I mean it seems obvious but I
mean<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:01.379> you're<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> water

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
mean really when you're in the water

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
mean really when you're in the water
it<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.609> helps<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> resistance<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it just helps because the resistance and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
it just helps because the resistance and
then<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.500> intense<00:01:05.010> pain<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.670> those

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
then it's not that intense pain on those

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
then it's not that intense pain on those
joints<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> absolutely<00:01:06.720> yeah<00:01:07.320> when

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
joints is that it absolutely yeah when

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
joints is that it absolutely yeah when
you're<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.799> 50<00:01:08.070> percent<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.090> waist

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you're at 50 percent at you're at waist
