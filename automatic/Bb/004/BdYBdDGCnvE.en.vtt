00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.360
 which such friends of youtube today 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:11.440
 I come to teach how to import more 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.410
 because you can see that in the monitos y halo 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:20.029
 mega clear blogs have only one eye and 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:24.710
 only one weapon fits but the bad thing is that it does not 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.660
 fit weapons that are more or less like 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.190
 Katana 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.329
 good that today is therefore more than 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.710
 you can load four weapons 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.710
 in this case it is this 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.230
 all right 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.360
 in this nice with three weapons 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.360
 but there is also another way 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.230
 but 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.110
 they do it like this this weapon they change it and what 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.630
 they put on this habit 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.630
 and here they will put the katana 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.100
 or so I recommend them more because 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.920
 we know father 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.920
 and if they want to remove a gun and put there 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.870
 the katana, it is to your liking where 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.830
 want the weapons 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.580
 good 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.400
 well there is no other but in this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.710
 you can only carry weapons that are not 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280
 they can load there in the back as 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280
 this 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 the design how it is done 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.770
 good all the necessary materials 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.770
 I'm going to put them here so you put them 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 better is this has to have here 112 and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 here other 2 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.650
 one of these lengths 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.590
 and the little ones of these 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.990
 it does not matter the color is that I have a 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 color of one and another of another because no 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.510
 I have another black if I had it 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.720
 it would be all black and here it is and it 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.070
 occupies a tube this these come out in 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.690
 the cars like for example these 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.600
 they came out in this but I did not put it on but 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.130
 good what's important 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.980
 good they will grab your sight 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.050
 his block cited this 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.410
 Y 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.950
 this is going to put 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.880
 so that in a way 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.330
 now the orange or the color that 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.330
 want 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.380
 they will accommodate it like this 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.170
 let him pause to show him the other one and 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.780
 the long one has to preferably down 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.990
 because in the rolls you can not 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.990
 so there will have to be something like that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.580
 something like that and up 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.450
 well go the last one this 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.470
 but this has to be 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.470
 to the opposite side 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.860
 is the one below 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:53.950
 but all good 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.520
 batista and now if you can put the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520
 weapons 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.109
 good 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.090
 for saying this weapon you can not for 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:11.690
 save it so 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.690
 the peace 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.760
 this you see 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.639
 A) Yes 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.330
 good 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.639
 now I dream you with being this good 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.129
 This is very easy those are not going to 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.400
 teach because nothing else is dealt with 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:48.259
 these blacks and a tube fits it in 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.259
 she is all 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.360
 good if he had two of these but one what 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:00.319
 is happening to the other there is no problem of 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.599
 who does use one of the one and another good in 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.599
 end because you already know 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.580
 As I was saying good, you know how 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.580
 do it and then 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:21.270
 I come from that pimp 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.270
 but also you 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:38.230
 and now you can also record these 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.230
 weapons with three charges other 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.939
 and you can also save the is 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.300
 Y 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.310
 and they already know how to do it so the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.410
 and subscribe please already know that to 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.550
 he helps me a lot with a like they do 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:03.410
 I know I barely have a video but I'm going 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.420
 to start making videos of how 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.960
 build things 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.450
 well see you in another video and then 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.460
 now you know how to do these is 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:21.020
 carry easier and easier and simpler 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.900
 now you do you make your own porta 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.169
 arm this helps you when you play 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.990
 I do not know things like that 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.620
 and that tells us you know why 9 change 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.770
 it does not have to fit then now 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.150
 they know how it fits or if they want they can 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.150
 make this the smallest 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.990
