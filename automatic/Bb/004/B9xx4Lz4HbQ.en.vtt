00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
game and that's the way the reason we

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.800 
game and that's the way the reason we
played<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.680> loved<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.130> know<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.910> if

there<00:03:00.080> are<00:03:00.350> acts<00:03:00.560> of<00:03:00.799> insidious<00:03:01.130> foul<00:03:01.580> play

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
there are acts of insidious foul play

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.920 
there are acts of insidious foul play
taking<00:03:02.090> place<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.600> people<00:03:02.690> are<00:03:02.870> getting

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
taking place and people are getting

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.259 
taking place and people are getting
injured<00:03:03.400> then<00:03:04.400> we<00:03:04.610> don't<00:03:04.730> want<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.150> the

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
injured then we don't want that in the

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.360 
injured then we don't want that in the
game<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.900> you<00:03:06.560> know<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.650> don't<00:03:06.980> think<00:03:07.010> he's<00:03:07.220> over

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
game so you know I don't think he's over

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.250 
game so you know I don't think he's over
sanitizing<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.090> still<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.269> very<00:03:08.450> tough<00:03:08.570> game

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
sanitizing it's still a very tough game

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.620 
sanitizing it's still a very tough game
it's<00:03:09.980> very<00:03:10.160> fast<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.000> even<00:03:11.239> faster<00:03:11.390> than

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it's very fast it's even faster than

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.360 
it's very fast it's even faster than
these<00:03:11.810> days<00:03:12.049> because<00:03:12.230> they're<00:03:12.500> bigger<00:03:12.980> fitter

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
these days because they're bigger fitter

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.729 
these days because they're bigger fitter
faster<00:03:13.760> stronger<00:03:14.330> than<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:15.170> my<00:03:15.380> playing<00:03:15.650> days

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739
