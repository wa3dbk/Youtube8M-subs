lands<00:00:26.869> not<00:00:27.529> in<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.910> next<00:00:29.240> set<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.689> this<00:00:29.869> is

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
lands not in the next set and this is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.630 
lands not in the next set and this is
very<00:00:30.140> sad<00:00:30.439> for<00:00:30.619> me<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.859> say<00:00:31.039> because<00:00:31.160> i've<00:00:31.400> been

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
very sad for me to say because i've been

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.840 
very sad for me to say because i've been
a<00:00:31.670> very<00:00:31.939> big<00:00:32.239> believer<00:00:33.309> there<00:00:34.309> would<00:00:34.489> be<00:00:34.519> in

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
a very big believer there would be in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.150 
a very big believer there would be in
the<00:00:35.030> September<00:00:35.690> corns<00:00:36.379> set<00:00:38.050> but<00:00:39.050> they<00:00:40.040> are

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
the September corns set but they are

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.770 
the September corns set but they are
probably<00:00:40.519> not<00:00:40.670> going<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:41.030> be<00:00:41.089> and<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.629> reason

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
probably not going to be and the reason

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.209 
probably not going to be and the reason
I<00:00:42.050> say<00:00:42.079> they're<00:00:42.469> not<00:00:42.649> going<00:00:42.770> to<00:00:42.829> be<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.070> this

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
I say they're not going to be in this

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.729 
I say they're not going to be in this
set<00:00:43.430> is<00:00:43.640> because<00:00:44.030> of<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.930> lack<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.200> support

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
set is because of the lack of support

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.209 
set is because of the lack of support
for<00:00:45.920> modern<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.579> there's<00:00:47.030> only<00:00:47.649> one<00:00:48.649> type<00:00:49.190> of

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
for modern and there's only one type of

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.520 
for modern and there's only one type of
breed<00:00:49.700> there's<00:00:50.149> only<00:00:50.210> one<00:00:50.360> reasoning<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.350> can

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
breed there's only one reasoning I can

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.100 
breed there's only one reasoning I can
get<00:00:51.770> from<00:00:52.129> lack<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.670> support<00:00:53.300> from<00:00:53.480> Aden<00:00:53.870> from

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
get from lack of support from Aden from

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.209 
get from lack of support from Aden from
Pro<00:00:54.410> Tours<00:00:54.770> pretty<00:00:55.340> cute<00:00:56.620> even<00:00:57.620> on<00:00:57.829> Twitter

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
Pro Tours pretty cute even on Twitter

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.500 
Pro Tours pretty cute even on Twitter
where<00:00:58.460> they're<00:00:58.579> saying<00:00:58.820> Laden<00:00:59.180> sucks

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
where they're saying Laden sucks

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.650 
where they're saying Laden sucks
essentially<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.350> guy<00:01:00.500> Aaron<00:01:01.149> for<00:01:02.149> Seth<00:01:02.390> says

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
essentially the guy Aaron for Seth says

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.570 
essentially the guy Aaron for Seth says
Laden<00:01:03.350> does<00:01:03.469> not<00:01:03.649> do<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.859> good<00:01:04.100> example<00:01:04.550> of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
Laden does not do a good example of

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.310 
Laden does not do a good example of
promoting<00:01:04.910> this<00:01:05.149> game<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:06.399> yeah<00:01:07.399> I<00:01:07.430> mean<00:01:07.850> it's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
promoting this game and yeah I mean it's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.810 
promoting this game and yeah I mean it's
probably<00:01:09.320> because<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.860> next<00:01:10.130> set<00:01:10.399> does<00:01:10.640> not

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
probably because the next set does not

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.449 
probably because the next set does not
have<00:01:11.119> fetch<00:01:11.390> lands<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:12.020> know<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:13.280> would

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
have fetch lands you know and that would

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.940 
have fetch lands you know and that would
be<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.759> disaster<00:01:14.360> they<00:01:14.869> kept<00:01:15.110> promoting<00:01:15.319> modern

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
be a disaster they kept promoting modern

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.779 
be a disaster they kept promoting modern
and<00:01:16.160> we<00:01:17.000> didn't<00:01:17.209> have<00:01:17.330> fetch<00:01:17.599> lands<00:01:17.899> until<00:01:18.789> m16

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
and we didn't have fetch lands until m16

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.120 
and we didn't have fetch lands until m16
and<00:01:20.149> then<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.020> price<00:01:21.319> of<00:01:21.500> these<00:01:21.619> vets<00:01:21.890> lands

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
and then the price of these vets lands

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.359 
and then the price of these vets lands
were<00:01:22.369> like<00:01:22.849> so<00:01:23.209> much<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:23.720> their<00:01:23.959> war<00:01:24.229> PT<00:01:24.979> queues

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
were like so much if their war PT queues

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.480 
were like so much if their war PT queues
and<00:01:25.899> pro<00:01:26.899> tours<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.679> stuff<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:27.979> are<00:01:28.220> they

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
and pro tours and stuff like are they

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.120 
and pro tours and stuff like are they
kept<00:01:28.670> promoting<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.649> as<00:01:30.649> much<00:01:30.979> as<00:01:31.009> they<00:01:31.250> did<00:01:31.310> I

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
kept promoting it as much as they did I

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.889 
kept promoting it as much as they did I
just<00:01:34.130> don't<00:01:34.310> see<00:01:34.520> them<00:01:34.729> in<00:01:34.910> this<00:01:35.060> new<00:01:35.420> new

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
definitely don't want to believe it but

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.029 
definitely don't want to believe it but
there's<00:01:41.420> no<00:01:41.599> other<00:01:41.780> explanation<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.890> it

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
there's no other explanation to it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.210 
there's no other explanation to it
except<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.789> fact<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.569> they<00:01:45.050> could<00:01:45.380> they

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
except the fact that they could they

except the fact that they could they
realized<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.390> would<00:01:47.539> be<00:01:47.840> fest<00:01:48.200> Lance<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
realized that it would be fest Lance the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.410 
realized that it would be fest Lance the
prices<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.160> lot<00:01:49.459> and<00:01:49.670> we're<00:01:49.789> making<00:01:49.940> people

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
prices a lot and we're making people

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.809 
prices a lot and we're making people
kind<00:01:50.660> of<00:01:50.720> angry<00:01:51.200> yeah<00:01:51.709> they<00:01:51.950> loved<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:52.369> format

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
kind of angry yeah they loved it format

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.059 
kind of angry yeah they loved it format
but<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.179> prices<00:01:53.420> are<00:01:53.569> just<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.560> secondary

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
but the prices are just the secondary

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.460 
but the prices are just the secondary
market<00:01:55.099> was<00:01:55.940> making<00:01:56.330> too<00:01:56.360> much<00:01:56.720> money<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:57.319> that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
market was making too much money if that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.609 
market was making too much money if that
