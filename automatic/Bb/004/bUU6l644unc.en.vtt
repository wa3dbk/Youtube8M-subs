obviously<00:01:45.619> when<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.860> start<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.220> game<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
obviously when you do start a game you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
obviously when you do start a game you
feel<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> keep<00:01:49.229> playing<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.680> keep

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.280 
responsibility on our shoulders but I
think<00:02:51.160> there's<00:02:51.310> girls<00:02:51.520> all<00:02:51.700> over<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.030> team

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
think there's girls all over the team

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.570 
think there's girls all over the team
obviously<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> last<00:02:53.860> game<00:02:54.100> Phil<00:02:54.340> Jagielka

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
obviously in the last game Phil Jagielka

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.449 
obviously in the last game Phil Jagielka
score<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.630> thing<00:02:55.840> than<00:02:56.050> me<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.340> know

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
score the thing than me so you know

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.130 
score the thing than me so you know
there's<00:02:57.880> goals<00:02:58.060> from<00:02:58.209> sender<00:02:58.570> back<00:02:58.720> from<00:02:58.930> set

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
there's goals from sender back from set

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.050 
there's goals from sender back from set
plays<00:02:59.380> as<00:02:59.590> well<00:02:59.739> so<00:02:59.950> we'll<00:03:00.400> all<00:03:00.520> be<00:03:00.640> looking<00:03:00.910> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
plays as well so we'll all be looking to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.820 
plays as well so we'll all be looking to
score<00:03:01.270> weather's<00:03:01.600> on<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.840> pitch<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> don't

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
score weather's on the pitch so I don't

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.710 
score weather's on the pitch so I don't
think<00:03:03.010> there's<00:03:03.160> too<00:03:03.310> much<00:03:03.459> pressure<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.180> one

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
think there's too much pressure on one

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.350 
think there's too much pressure on one
individual<00:03:05.440> position<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.310> want<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.550> get<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
individual position you want to get the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.150 
individual position you want to get the
qualifying<00:03:08.020> wrapped<00:03:08.260> up<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.560> soon<00:03:08.680> as<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:08.950> can

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
qualifying wrapped up as soon as you can

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.729 
qualifying wrapped up as soon as you can
so<00:03:09.430> we'll<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.060> looking<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.510> push<00:03:10.989> every<00:03:11.530> game

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
so we'll be looking to push every game

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.650 
so we'll be looking to push every game
and<00:03:12.190> as<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.459> said<00:03:12.610> approach<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.269> same<00:03:13.480> way

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
and as I said approach in the same way

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.479 
and as I said approach in the same way
and<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.320> never<00:03:14.440> step<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.070> pitch<00:03:15.280> to

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
and we never step on to the pitch to

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.860 
and we never step on to the pitch to
draw<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:16.000> lose<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.300> know<00:03:16.390> we'll<00:03:16.570> always<00:03:16.600> be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
draw to lose you know we'll always be

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.930 
draw to lose you know we'll always be
looking<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.230> win<00:03:17.380> but<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.860> think<00:03:18.310> step<00:03:18.519> by<00:03:18.670> step

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
looking to win but I think step by step

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.460 
looking to win but I think step by step
you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.300> first<00:03:19.510> games<00:03:19.780> on<00:03:19.959> Friday<00:03:20.080> we'll

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
you know the first games on Friday we'll

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.080 
you know the first games on Friday we'll
be<00:03:20.500> looking<00:03:20.680> at<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.250> trying<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.970> win

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
be looking at that one and trying to win

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.190 
be looking at that one and trying to win
that<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.780> then<00:03:22.870> we<00:03:22.900> can<00:03:23.110> look

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
that and then and then we can look

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.259 
that and then and then we can look
forward<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.950> next<00:03:23.980> game<00:03:24.250> after<00:03:24.549> that<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
forward to the next game after that the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.140 
forward to the next game after that the
manager<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:25.810> he's<00:03:26.320> got<00:03:26.530> more<00:03:26.680> time<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
manager now he's got more time to to

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.180 
manager now he's got more time to to
build<00:03:28.360> what<00:03:28.540> he<00:03:28.630> wants<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.930> do<00:03:29.140> with<00:03:29.290> us<00:03:29.410> and

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
build what he wants to do with us and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.710 
build what he wants to do with us and
we've<00:03:30.549> been<00:03:30.700> working<00:03:30.850> on<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.150> already<00:03:31.420> in

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
we've been working on that already in

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.690 
we've been working on that already in
training<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:33.070> think<00:03:33.280> all<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.489> players

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
training and and I think all the players

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.280 
training and and I think all the players
understand<00:03:34.269> what<00:03:34.390> he<00:03:34.480> needs<00:03:34.690> from<00:03:34.840> Muslim<00:03:35.140> and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
understand what he needs from Muslim and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.110 
understand what he needs from Muslim and
what<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.560> wants<00:03:35.830> so<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.280> far<00:03:36.519> it's<00:03:36.970> going

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
what it wants so so far it's going

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.090 
what it wants so so far it's going
really<00:03:37.360> well<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.870> know<00:03:38.049> we'll<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.709> massive

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
really well you know we'll have massive

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.620 
really well you know we'll have massive
respect<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:39.580> him<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.820> he's<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.239> really<00:03:40.299> good

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630

you express yourself and do your thing
in<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> right<00:03:46.690> areas<00:03:46.989> of<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.170> picture<00:03:47.530> is

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
in the right areas of the picture is

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.640 
in the right areas of the picture is
massive<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.940> not<00:03:49.780> only<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> really

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
massive and not only that is a really

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.800 
massive and not only that is a really
good<00:03:50.890> man<00:03:51.280> off<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.519> pitch<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.209> really

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
good man off the pitch is really

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.720 
good man off the pitch is really
approach<00:03:53.110> boy<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.890> can<00:03:54.040> have<00:03:54.160> sit<00:03:54.400> down<00:03:54.549> and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
approach boy you can have sit down and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.310 
approach boy you can have sit down and
have<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> chat<00:03:54.910> about<00:03:55.150> anything<00:03:55.600> holidays

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
have a chat about anything holidays

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.960 
have a chat about anything holidays
anything<00:03:56.920> like<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:57.100> so<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.519> really<00:03:57.730> good

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
anything like that so that's really good

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.820 
anything like that so that's really good
as<00:03:58.060> well<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.330> I<00:03:58.390> think<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:59.110> always<00:03:59.260> builds

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
as well and I think that always builds

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.870 
as well and I think that always builds
when<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.220> can<00:04:00.370> build<00:04:00.519> up<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.730> relationship

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
when you can build up a relationship

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.390 
when you can build up a relationship
like<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.420> with<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.720> manager<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.980> my<00:04:03.100> past

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
like that with a manager in my past

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.670 
like that with a manager in my past
experiences<00:04:04.000> helped<00:04:04.540> me<00:04:04.660> massively<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.350> go

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
experiences helped me massively to go

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.110 
experiences helped me massively to go
out<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:05.980> if<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.340> ever<00:04:06.489> got<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.700> problem<00:04:06.910> you

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
out and if you ever got a problem you

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.330 
out and if you ever got a problem you
can<00:04:07.269> go<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.480> them<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.350> know<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.799> manager

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
can go to them so you know the manager

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.250 
can go to them so you know the manager
has<00:04:09.610> got<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.910> kind<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.239> kind<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.690> site<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.080> so

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
has got that kind of kind of site and so

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.920 
has got that kind of kind of site and so
it's<00:04:11.380> really<00:04:11.500> good<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:11.830> us
