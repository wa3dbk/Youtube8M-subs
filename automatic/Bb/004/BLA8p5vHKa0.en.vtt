00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.929
 Halo has come to a new video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.529
 open channel buy all for democracy 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.840
 and there follows the nix last may 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:16.830
 imagine video with 890 if it is then 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.109
 Sometime at the store we are available 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.609
 Wait a while now fluffy 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 somewhere and try to kill us 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.890
 because I do not tie the prostep so 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 and have absolutely never played 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 By the way, they are a bit happy 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.840
 he thinks he has to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840
 maybe get something 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.440
 but you can hear on 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.120
 like this 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.440
 Now you have to look a bit here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.260
 much more attentive bochum ots 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.059
 player as good as not at all 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.079
 is stupid 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.079
 we'll just try it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.119
 it is not a weapon we carry one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.560
 Masters generally sharper of the same 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.560
 ak women try to go loose 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:28.250
 nice nice nice ok thank you reload 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.579
 By the way, I'm very curious what they are 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.740
 cost accounting as something with 30,000 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.759
 Chancellor 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.380
 either is record-breaking or expensive 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.230
 record-breaking cheap in between 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.100
 there will probably be 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.100
 the damage is 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.620
 pity with this kill and this for 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.810
 the one I have right now 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.090
 I say goodbye to myself from 600 gr 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.780
 with it if it's the last game 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.600
 For Cathy, that's the first one 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.130
 a bit like it again 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 more or less I mention 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.080
 do not even say goodbye to me then 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.080
 again with it
