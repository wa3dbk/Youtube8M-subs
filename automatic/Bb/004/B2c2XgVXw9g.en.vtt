00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.259
 well we all go to all these tasks I hope you have the strength 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.629
 not to think in super good we find today for the second 

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.050
 episode presentation of the medals 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.579
 on this 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.640
 in the college forward 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.819
 a person who never realizes you will leave his village 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.639
 poor tragedy adopted excuse me we pass we can do that either I have 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.170
 disputed on the psf 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.530
 do not hesitate to try it also to you want me to do 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.400
 the presentations of the shares redeemed the seven and it's gone on 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.440
 can start the presentation of the village the second in the series 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.180
 so already this opinion is a game bought the building trap 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
 this test which also for their age test flagship 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060
 because three strategic holes 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.200
 for them troops can penetrate but if ever the two candidates 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.430
 and yes to distrust 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.110
 because a troop Ã©mile blessig and holes the agent of the actress camouflaged 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.450
 The traps 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.230
 benmouna it's three holes 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.050
 to be able to mark also with whom she hoped he post forward center but 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.710
 did not come out anymore 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 that the meaning of the treaty constitutes his second in something more 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 very solid 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.480
 for the time not from here costs gaston sorcerer dispose competent 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.690
 m if our analysis bravo huh 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.840
 archives and barbarities committed in not even two seconds 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.480
 but also mortars that are a little have them on the sides 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.049
 all the Algerian people who is the biggest or very easily all of them 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.190
 troops 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.420
 but also the reluctant artic sea 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 arranged in triangle 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.630
 the anti-aircraft defenses on its side which counts 44 tasks half of 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.410
 workers say they are opposed to the environment 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.400
 and also this plant 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.130
 candy soral 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.590
 we did it well during all the troops that are activated 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.650
 and in the future 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.010
 me thompson is for now we are very quickly maybe more you ask 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.520
 there are also groups that drew the enemy's troops 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 so all that really makes it to rome 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.309
 a very beautiful village 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.339
 after he is also one of the weak points for example here 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:15.689
 if you have a lot of resources 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.459
 the opponent only has to criticize himself illegal white a word on your blog 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.039
 talk about minutes 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.649
 and that's really terrifying 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.969
 but on the other hand you will see right away that the towers of the earth 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.130
 those who are in single mode 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.510
 they're really squeezing it on a strategic withdrawal 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.079
 for jean-pierre 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.899
 the progress of the Picardy dragons and also the hills 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.069
 so these parties already you can see it 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.239
 what I find the successful defense in five days is not bad 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.979
 and here we go from a gameplay shop 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 who will show so tactical combat 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.489
 so you can already see that the person attacked 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 at 18 years old decided to pose outside 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.279
 with them so that the calculation per month 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.589
 to be able to support them 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.179
 I accelerate a little bit 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.739
 So here we look 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:05.799
 look at her 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.899
 seeing the giant bombs ticking 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.059
 there were all the troops that asked it's going to be still big carnage 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.119
 ivory 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:13.809
 I want to continue the good 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.410
 she fills all the barbarians 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.469
 and all the archers who exhibit 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.469
 but after a small aluminum roof as a facilitator 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.839
 with the best managers and with market shares can necessarily 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.529
 Flagship tournaments are not very effective 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.629
 you will see everything on time 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.169
 so his second baby that it's really very effective in others 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.389
 plotting 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.869
 so look i'll show you the second since niculae 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.269
 christina who in battle 2d i do not find that this morning threatening 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.269
 openly that 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.689
 ask directly 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.299
 stuck at barbara here it's really something crucial that ever 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.039
 do that 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.269
 the level of his pursuing relatives 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.589
 it's very very dangerous you never have to do that 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.869
 because simply 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.530
 in his opinion you have to go out 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.969
 and sakineh mortars touch so that if it changes places 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.389
 to return to their villages by is at a crossroads to great not be 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.809
 sorcerer their advantage to score 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.609
 infra the dead who will pay 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 elliott will be a lot easier to work 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.079
 want to remind you that barbarians to destroy in two seconds 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 but per cent there were not as many competitors easily 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.349
 so here I think that's all I had to say in this video 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.360
 he did not hesitate to copy this village why your age exists and 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.990
 if you ever want to win trophies quickly that wanted to form 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.150
 at the same time at his parents' home a very complete village 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.780
 also do not hesitate to which video if you want other episodes 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.120
 could exist here are the seven I also know how to make presentations 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.669
 of used it delimits with 8 9 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.199
 do not hesitate 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.370
 after winning the gold and the person 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.569
 for the win 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.010
 the same if we just wanted to sincerely regret 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.790
 at the request of vaccinated people ie if it happened with 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.779
 abandoning the idea that he is destined 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.659
 marseille 23 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.710
 the analysis is easy to access the balloon vecquerie instead of 34 seconds 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:04.020
 are not enough really superb 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.169
 and so what could come is the schlague 9 rock 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.779
 I have 89 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:11.839
 do not hesitate to come the big loan a lot of people 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.519
 I tell you to approached friends ciao
