00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone today small 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.109
 video to teach you a new 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.530
 magic trick a magic trick that gets 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 will do with a blue package so I'm going 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.309
 you do it and then you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 explain it first of all I ask the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.060
 spectators to come stock one kills the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.820
 imagine here he falls on him 8 2 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 tiles 8 declare high and put back on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 the top of the pack a cut is enough a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.309
 snap of fingers and a card 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.570
 appears in the paper a map 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.160
 particular since it is a map 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.070
 red 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.739
 but what is this red card 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 I ask myself well and it's the 8th 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.559
 of tiles the spectator's card 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.950
 now let's go right to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950
 explanations 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.820
 so for this magic trick it will make you 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.859
 two packets of the same brand of the same 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.619
 design thousand names of the same color 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.900
 so here I have a style and offenbach 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 red and a Thai and offenbach blue so 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 take the blue pack take it in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.310
 integer it by cons for the package 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.500
 red 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.330
 we need to take only one card 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.640
 the red package can be relocated where it 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 wants so we have a map 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.670
 Anyway here the 3 2 tiles map 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.810
 any red the package this is the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.920
 cold blue package so the red card 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 must be in last position 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.820
 like this before the turn so here's the 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.369
 preparation made you can start 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 the magic trick introduce you to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.159
 spectators the package obviously does not make 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 not shown the red card because the turn 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.610
 will be ruined so you show that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.270
 the package and normal blue the viewer 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.510
 choose a map for this example I 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.930
 will choose the 8 of truce 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.720
 you just have to put the map back on 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.069
 the top of the pack and as you go 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.750
 brooded the red card anyway is going to get 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:31.459
 find at the top of the map of 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:33.769
 viewer like this so we 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.220
 find in this position the map 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.159
 red 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.420
 the viewer's map here you are 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.560
 snap your fingers do you 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.560
 to appear the red card 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.459
 you just have to lift 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.909
 double to make believe that the map 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.389
 red 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.060
 the spectator's card so there the vix 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.459
 double it's very easy you effect them 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.019
 eyes and when you see you are 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.250
 arrived at the last two cards 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:04.370
 you have to put your finger and 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.430
 lift both cartons a time for 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.310
 to believe that there is only one 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.959
 has two and we raise as if we in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.849
 had a 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.500
 so here I hope this little trick of 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.500
 magic will have pleased you and at the next
