00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 In this video, I'll show you. 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.400
 some tips there techniques for you 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.109
 try idea box 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.120
 this little box that is a box of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 bathroom that will be used at a party 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 I already told you about them 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.330
 here on the link to this video above 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 Wanna check it out Can you take a look? 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.350
 but I will not go into detail but it is the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 fifth with this video until what it is to do 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 which brings some tips to anyone who never 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 He beeped I also never had painted 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.830
 I took some common tips with some 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 friends who helped me a lot and I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.510
 I get a very good result 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.969
 you can see the success with two 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 originals here type aaa the best saying 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.940
 the box of mdf without painting without leaving 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.590
 without anything it is raw and here 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.660
 after it's ready and that's what we 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.480
 which it will do here what was going 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.940
 the box is one that is a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.670
 little box will work for me but if 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 find another leave of your preference 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 the idea is to trash a fine rain you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.820
 can also find in the same scheme 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.549
 Chinese even have foam that may be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 because the note in the course of xinhua 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.720
 aliche in case you want to do the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 corners to brush 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 this is the number 10 and you can buy the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.650
 the smallest of your choice 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 the first personal step I was going to make 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.570
 a brief closing of the two 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 and there are people who do not like 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.009
 tea leaves even in people who 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 prefer to call I honestly prefer 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.020
 Sanding to give the best finish, right? 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 the burr is not so coarse is the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.100
 first step to do but then I had 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.100
 quick basque 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.270
 It is best that in these board games 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.120
 So the people I have video here for 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.240
 give a lot of big cliches here for 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.550
 take the burr lines here also to 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.110
 become finish made it or not 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.800
 your own 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.990
 Let's go the coolest part to paint is 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.479
 there is such a rule to begin with 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 here to start there but I prefer it 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:13.180
 here is painted with paint inside is the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 who had the clinic at the same time 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.080
 store where I bought the caches starts with 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.800
 here was important to take 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:30.489
 all the coming dirt exists and it's fine 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.410
 interesting with the first brush and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.510
 then to how the environment takes if people 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 Just a little bit to get those 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.370
 lines with the brush since then let's go 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.799
 guys start trying that I go there 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.680
 try the following video based on the base 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.010
 From the brush, we come back to show you 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.739
 you the issue of using the scroll 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.420
 it's in the corner here firsthand 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.370
 staff do not worry too much that he 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 will be very well done and let's go 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.110
 so this first leg of the first leg 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.420
 of ink better then come on 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.010
 staff who are here we vote so 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.790
 finish making the background that the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.070
 brush 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.709
 I vote on you are the use of 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.440
 robot is given the river who dispute 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.360
 stayed there the staff is finishing the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.410
 team tries to make the first leg with the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.010
 brush 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.680
 how can you observe the flood and this 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.930
 reduces traffic 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:32.849
 the brush takes first hand with holly well 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.959
 light without pressing too much you pass from 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:40.680
 smooth shape or make half with the ball 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:04:16.280
 ie the difference observed where 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:04:39.180
 We passed the line and where not spent 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:42.210
 difference there the quality of the final 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:48.150
 How many new you pass, I go, I do not 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.750
 I remember for sure how much easier it is 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.750
 fast 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.500
 I passed several hands op 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.210
 this was the first hand on the bottom 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.280
 interesting is to take a little time to wait 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.420
 dry the bottom you want to do the other 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:09.960
 here I can do sides inside 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.710
 then do it on the outside but it's a 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.480
 My preference but he has a lot going 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.970
 depending on how you would adapt better 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.160
 to make the internal parts gives 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.330
 Time to dry, we do the part. 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.100
 standing on the inside the sides 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.550
 we have a little bit here later 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.360
 car that also makes the outer parts 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.040
 of this personal touch box with the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.950
 tips I will not lengthen the video because 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:41.280
 paint all cast is more plants 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.620
 some tips here for you to stay better 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.080
 their craft and now in the sequence 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.450
 returned to show the steps that what I 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.550
 I'll stay or conclude so that you 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.160
 you can see the final result there 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.050
 okay, okay staff then 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.570
 This is where our little box appears. 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.840
 after the first leg 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:04.230
 and for those who have 109 and have questions 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.870
 It was closed the same month as the 30 40 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.290
 had an hour at the most next pass 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.840
 by hand and then you go he's going to dance 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.810
 ending and these spots and color 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.510
 getting well is bright white with a sister 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.850
 young then this is it personal I will not be 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.770
 In this video I'll bring another box 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.860
 because he decided to show some techniques 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:30.000
 Even he did not show that entering this 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.980
 interesting then, come here 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.530
 as I told you then was one 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.530
 Anything happens, you can. 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.810
 pass the rain just fine 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.620
 leave more lisinha in case you want 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:47.580
 end result will be this one I went 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.520
 411 blood and ink 45 years old on the 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.040
 case 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.620
 The more you passed, the more cute. 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.210
 until the end, it's there, I hope 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.110
