different<00:03:32.019> type<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> scenarios<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.280> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
different type of scenarios in the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.339 
different type of scenarios in the
scenario<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.299> have<00:03:34.389> an<00:03:34.510> enemy<00:03:34.810> pathfinder

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
trying to harass one of my teammates so

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.809 
trying to harass one of my teammates so
I<00:03:37.510> open<00:03:37.900> up<00:03:37.989> with<00:03:38.169> disorienting<00:03:38.799> strike<00:03:39.220> apply

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
I open up with disorienting strike apply

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.479 
I open up with disorienting strike apply
three<00:03:40.209> punctures<00:03:40.599> auto<00:03:41.530> attack<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.280> can<00:03:42.400> get

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
three punctures auto attack so I can get

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.180 
three punctures auto attack so I can get
so<00:03:42.700> my<00:03:42.819> energy<00:03:43.239> back<00:03:43.620> continue<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.799> apply<00:03:45.099> a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.030 
so my energy back continue to apply a
puncture<00:03:45.720> use<00:03:46.720> Shadow<00:03:47.079> shift<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.620> no<00:03:47.769> one<00:03:47.919> can

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
puncture use Shadow shift so no one can

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.039 
puncture use Shadow shift so no one can
help<00:03:48.250> him<00:03:48.430> out<00:03:48.579> lucky<00:03:49.209> enough<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.750> still

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.250 
so I'm trying to apply as much pressure
as<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:03.969> with<00:04:04.120> my<00:04:04.150> autotext<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.900> puncture

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
as I can with my autotext and puncture

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.530 
as I can with my autotext and puncture
but<00:04:05.439> yet<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.069> had<00:04:06.310> no<00:04:06.459> choice<00:04:06.489> but<00:04:06.969> to<00:04:07.150> use<00:04:07.209> my

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
but yet I had no choice but to use my

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.449 
but yet I had no choice but to use my
shadow<00:04:08.019> shift<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.409> save<00:04:08.590> his<00:04:08.709> life<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.159> pick

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
shadow shift to save his life and pick

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.429 
shadow shift to save his life and pick
up<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.760> kill<00:04:09.969> that's<00:04:10.269> one<00:04:10.599> of<00:04:10.719> many<00:04:10.840> ways<00:04:11.139> of

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 
up the kill that's one of many ways of

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.239 
up the kill that's one of many ways of
using<00:04:11.980> shadow<00:04:12.370> shift<00:04:13.499> so<00:04:14.499> my<00:04:14.650> teammate<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.099> I

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:15.249 
using shadow shift so my teammate and I

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.979 
using shadow shift so my teammate and I
pretty<00:04:15.579> much<00:04:15.639> decided<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.329> double<00:04:16.660> team<00:04:16.810> on

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
pretty much decided to double team on

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.439 
pretty much decided to double team on
their<00:04:17.109> healer<00:04:17.519> sadly<00:04:18.519> though<00:04:18.699> he<00:04:18.940> does<00:04:19.150> die

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
their healer sadly though he does die

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.599 
their healer sadly though he does die
and<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:20.019> do<00:04:20.079> get<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.470> chance<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.979> get<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.370> kill

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
and I do get a chance to get the kill

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.600 
and I do get a chance to get the kill
but<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.539> have<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.900> pathfinders<00:04:23.620> around<00:04:23.860> me<00:04:24.039> so<00:04:24.400> I

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
but I have to pathfinders around me so I

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.159 
but I have to pathfinders around me so I
jumped<00:04:25.000> down<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.150> smoke<00:04:25.449> bomb<00:04:25.630> hoping<00:04:26.050> to

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
jumped down the smoke bomb hoping to

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.080 
jumped down the smoke bomb hoping to
negate<00:04:26.470> any<00:04:26.620> damage<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.430> might<00:04:27.729> hurt<00:04:27.910> me

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
negate any damage that might hurt me

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.089 
negate any damage that might hurt me
giving<00:04:28.840> me<00:04:28.930> enough<00:04:29.229> time<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.590> stealth

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
giving me enough time to stealth

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.010 
giving me enough time to stealth
hopefully<00:04:31.000> they<00:04:31.210> won't<00:04:31.360> find<00:04:31.630> me<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:31.900> this

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
hopefully they won't find me in this

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.890 
hopefully they won't find me in this
