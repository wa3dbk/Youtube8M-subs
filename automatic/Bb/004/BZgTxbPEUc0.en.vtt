Photoshop and I put the patch and if you
see<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:28.229> nose<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.860> really<00:01:29.369> close<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.210> snake

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
see the nose is really close to snake

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
nose the color is different because this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.620 
nose the color is different because this
is<00:01:33.479> our<00:01:33.750> daylight<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.150> inside<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
where it finish you will notice that if

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.319 
where it finish you will notice that if
I<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:17.790> again<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.299> snake<00:03:20.260> face<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:22.120> will

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
I get this again to snake face it will

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.009 
I get this again to snake face it will
much<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:23.530> will<00:03:23.799> match<00:03:24.040> exactly<00:03:25.019> exactly

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
much it will match exactly exactly

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.770 
much it will match exactly exactly
exactly

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
exactly

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.800 
exactly
even<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:30.540> perspective<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:34.390> different

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
even if the perspective it's different

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.599 
even if the perspective it's different
the<00:03:34.959> angles<00:03:35.290> it's<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.799> little<00:03:36.069> bit<00:03:36.190> different

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
the angles it's a little bit different

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.660 
the angles it's a little bit different
you<00:03:36.670> can<00:03:36.940> see<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.540> here<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.560> nose<00:03:38.799> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
you can see that in here the nose the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.280 
you can see that in here the nose the
tip<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> nose<00:03:40.420> or<00:03:40.959> his<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.840> part<00:03:44.170> of

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
tip of the nose or his the this part of

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.890 
tip of the nose or his the this part of
the<00:03:44.410> face<00:03:44.620> he<00:03:44.920> or<00:03:45.579> not<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.690> same

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the face he or not it's not the same

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.379 
the face he or not it's not the same
angle<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.670> anyway<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:49.480> match<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.730> confirms

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
angle so anyway it match that confirms

00:03:52.389 --> 00:04:00.319 
angle so anyway it match that confirms
to<00:03:53.170> me<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:55.709> medic<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:57.430> snake<00:03:58.209> it's<00:03:58.810> via<00:03:59.650> snake
