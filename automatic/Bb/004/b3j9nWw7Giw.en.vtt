save it as a powerpoint now that was
strange<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.850> first<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
strange to me at first but what I

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.700 
strange to me at first but what I
discovered<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
discovered is that when I do that it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.850 
discovered is that when I do that it
saves<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.970> format<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
saves it into a different format and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
saves it into a different format and
that<00:01:19.860> presentation<00:01:20.520> opens<00:01:20.939> again<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that presentation opens again the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.520 
that presentation opens again the
difference<00:01:22.770> between<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:24.330> format<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:25.110> or<00:01:25.409> at

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
difference between the format now or at

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
difference between the format now or at
least<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> app<00:01:26.610> behaves<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
least the way that the app behaves is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.660 
least the way that the app behaves is
that<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> click<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> plus<00:01:29.369> sign<00:01:29.640> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
that if you click on the plus sign in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
that if you click on the plus sign in
the<00:01:29.820> upper<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.329> hand<00:01:30.509> corner<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:31.320> add
