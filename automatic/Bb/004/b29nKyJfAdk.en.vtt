00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.660
 dear gaming friends my name sirius 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.980
 and today there is a video for the so-called 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 graphics card geforce gtx 780 amp edition 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.869
 this is an overclocked variant of the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 standard gtx 780 and how to get here completely 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 can see beautiful distinguishes the busy 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.590
 of course, immediately by the cool construction 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.539
 while the standard gtx 480 in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.199
 reference design is one can here completely 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.230
 nice to see 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.530
 triple silence that is a bit quieter 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 but are also mainly the card 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 should keep much cooler than us 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 have installed three fans here as well 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 a slightly different turbulence of the air 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.329
 cause and in the next days 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 which thing holds up properly for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.629
 test you if it in my new pc 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.059
 version was installed and just times 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.020
 look what brings this standard 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.940
 overclocking causing the 780 m 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.640
 faster than a standard 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 titan the newly revised version of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 the gtx 480 amp works in the core 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.490
 a 1600 mhz base clock and should be up 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.930
 I boost at 1000 150 megahertz high 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 Now pack the piece for once 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 you he finds out most but 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 interesting what's inside in his 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 Packaging and that can us now 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.700
 have a look together 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 I think that for the pc enthusiast 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.369
 especially upcoming benchmarks 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.229
 be interesting 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.590
 I'll be back where I am tonight 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.200
 now at the moment a gtx 87 installed 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.299
 in referenzdesign just the times 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.189
 Run firestorm benchmark and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.649
 then if I'm in the next one two 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.119
 three days here the pc put on new 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.860
 have new ones with new processors 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.240
 mainboard and so on and so forth 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 right here with the m 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.409
 then it will benchmark the comparative 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.119
 so settled are of course here 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 Power adapter cable should I use the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.500
 single unpacking no I leave that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.110
 Just maybe you know that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.119
 Then there is a dvi clutch 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.240
 I would say 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.880
 again stream that is mainly for 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.280
 older power supplies well, I guess 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.060
 that does not come too much for me now 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 to wear short close up on the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.640
 triple silence and you can say here 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.430
 that's the typical m design 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.830
 the orange cooler with this black 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.240
 brand design I think that looks extreme 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.910
 Stylish from what you still have 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.610
 can recognize that the three students 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.959
 different are the outer 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.810
 Fans simply have a diameter 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.550
 of 80 mm and the middle in whole 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.840
 chosen a little bit larger with 90 mm 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.280
 Of course, you can also see from the side 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.400
 Once again, the open design is quite nice 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.670
 in contrast to the reference design of gtx 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.470
 87 which is very closed and the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.530
 heated air through the graphics card 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.810
 only to the rear of the pc housing 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.970
 It leads out at the amp edition 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 so that the air he gets swirled and 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.770
 forward and backward into the pc 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.390
 housing is headed but that is 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.519
 basically not such a big one right now 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.830
 problem because the card through the fan 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.650
 either way it will not be that warm either 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.660
 one way or another, not so much hot air 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 I want to do that 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.239
 describe that but we will be in one 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.320
 Test then learn even more detail 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.940
 yes I'm just now 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.130
 in the end, very curious how 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.739
 the card then from tomorrow the day after tomorrow 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.630
 I will have to run in the new system 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.989
 then a new cpu and me 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.049
 am then switched again from sli 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.470
 on a single gpu graphics card because I 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.850
 just think that the 780 m soy one 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.160
 better price performance ratio 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.410
 offers and sometimes with a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.970
 single gpu simply less problems 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.260
 we should have seen here yet 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.630
 a little bit, what about that 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.340
 package there was in splinter cell 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.470
 These were just drivers and 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.250
 this is a short look in here 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.810
 the operating instructions in general 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.390
 Maybe you could mention that 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.989
 in contrast to reference design, this is 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.030
 I think 863 megahertz works 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:22.030
 here on direct x 1006 megahertz 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.389
 which of course has already covered one 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.840
 is a relatively large jump and also with 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.780
 the bios update now with around 1150 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.500
 mhz in boost is pretty much the fastest 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.190
 even if I have the fastest gtx 780 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.970
 I would like to have everyone in the race 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.470
 here are a few close-ups 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.270
 also for one or the other 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.580
 of course I am also enthusiastic 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.919
 take again if the card 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.230
 to be in operation 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.860
 so I thought it is then 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.230
 maybe even more 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.320
 Interesting that the standard design of the 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.480
 soltec gtx 280 next to see what yes 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.400
 by nvidia is so given and there 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.830
 you can actually see it on the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.780
 first look at that reference design 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.770
 very small is a little smaller though it is 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.020
 also the card the reference design of the 87 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.910
 is already a really thicker 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.790
 brummer I would like to say that to myself 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.040
 find the reference design of the 780's 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.510
 really beautiful yes i love these 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.500
 card but I also stand on this 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.900
 tuned style of the amp and ultimately 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.270
 actually comes only on the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.460
 performance at because are always honest too 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.530
 if it looks nice like the cards in the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.750
 housings are usually installed 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.450
 at least that's how the calculator stands 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.360
 under the table and then counts under 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.229
 then it was just a matter of power 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.940
 and at frames we at battlefield 4 and 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:54.280
 co be achieved so if i am very 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.250
 I should be diligent 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.320
 a few technical specifications 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.419
 in the video description with purely me 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.120
 find such numbers to read 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.490
 somehow more gripping than me the five times 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.200
 in a video to hear here you see 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.060
 again the direct comparison of the dm 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.030
 a little bit longer again 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.650
 is and yes I think for the weekend 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.229
 Do you also see a video where the 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.270
 map is installed I say thanks for 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.919
 watch until the next hardware 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.919
 video and skin in
