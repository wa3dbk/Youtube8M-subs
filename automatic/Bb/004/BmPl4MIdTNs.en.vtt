00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.750
 Welcome once more 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.149
 this time we will make reference to what is reading and learning 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.879
 It is also interesting to start from a question of a question 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.509
 how we come to learning 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.890
 which means reading in the context of learning 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.569
 Well there is a lot to explain 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.890
 as they would say 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 many people there is a lot of fabric to cut 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.340
 let's see reading is one of the highest functions of the brain 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.540
 human 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.970
 and one of the essential functions of life why 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.310
 because a true reading puts into operation 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.970
 to our intelligence 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.130
 to the human brain 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.210
 and it is one of the functions 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.640
 essential for coexistence 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.410
 in society 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.140
 everything that is learned has its origin 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.530
 in reading skills and abilities 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.600
 who can say that he learned 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 without clear reading obviously many things we can learn without reading 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.840
 we could say in quotes 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.330
 we learn without reading 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.060
 but perhaps the fact of getting in touch with nature 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.550
 perhaps the fact that he observes 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.579
 perhaps the fact of contemplating an afternoon full of sun or an afternoon 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.550
 that the mist falls we are not interpreting 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.180
 perhaps we do not think about the fall of the rain 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.290
 when we see lightning 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.050
 when we hear thunder 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.090
 and that's reading too 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.010
 of course not a reading 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.560
 in the text but it's a reading 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.830
 a reading is also then knowing how to interpret is knowing how to understand 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.510
 not only what the texts say but what 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.060
 surrounds us and what is in nature now in relation to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.939
 the reading 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.599
 which is said for example when we are faced with certain problems or 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.520
 when we are facing the children we say that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.700
 the earlier the child learns to read 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.100
 more effective will be the ability to adapt 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.899
 and interpret the world then look 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.589
 if I learn to read a book 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.099
 I will also learn to interpret 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.149
 the world 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.080
 then knowledge is not only in the books 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.969
 is in the books and is in 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.129
 nature 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.569
 it is in what surrounds us 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.809
 in regard to reading it is necessary to discard that myth or the idea 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.019
 wrong 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:35.889
 to say 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.469
 that the sooner you learn to read a child the faster you get tired 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.809
 and does not like school or college 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.559
 it's something absurd 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.309
 Well, as we have observed while 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:52.289
 early is the age at which the child learns to read 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.860
 much sooner it will take over 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.779
 of the world will take over knowledge 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.999
 you will know much more 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.529
 and much better 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.739
 facing the subject of reading 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.649
 the role of parents in the home 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:10.249
 and the teachers at school 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.059
 It's fundamental 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.269
 why it is fundamental 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.249
 because the boy the young 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.779
 learn through example 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.079
 and if you do not see the example in the parents 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.409
 if you do not see that example in your teachers 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.999
 what need will the child have the young 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.999
 to learn to read 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.210
 what will the child's motivation be? 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.559
 or the young person to 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.369
 take a book and read 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:44.759
 then parents and teachers are the first to be readers 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.689
 and good readers 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.299
 so that in them is the example 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.209
 a child who grows up in an environment of parents and teacher readers 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.359
 It will surely be a good reader 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.059
 and a good reader 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:03.849
 he is a good connoisseur of the things of the world 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.229
 and is one of the great winners in life 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.879
 thank you
