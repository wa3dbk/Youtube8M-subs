there but part of me is like you know
maybe<00:02:56.550> they<00:02:56.790> might<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.180> happier<00:02:57.540> just<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
maybe they might be happier just in the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.050 
maybe they might be happier just in the
wild<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.310> jurassic<00:02:59.670> world<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.940> going

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
really really good here I'm very happy

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.500 
really really good here I'm very happy
with<00:04:49.560> it<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.730> course<00:04:50.760> before<00:04:51.270> she

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
with it and this is of course before she

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.600 
with it and this is of course before she
roars<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.050> Pteranodons<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.580> next

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
roars of the Pteranodons so the next

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.450 
roars of the Pteranodons so the next
shot<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.590> Pteranodon<00:04:55.590> escaping<00:04:56.310> the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
shot is you Pteranodon escaping the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.270 
shot is you Pteranodon escaping the
aviary<00:04:56.880> just<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.300> single<00:04:57.570> turn<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.470> mean

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
aviary just a single turn it on I mean

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.470 
aviary just a single turn it on I mean
there's<00:04:59.580> not<00:04:59.700> really<00:04:59.910> much<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.150> talk<00:05:00.360> about

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
there's not really much to talk about

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.050 
there's not really much to talk about
here<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.200> most<00:05:01.830> likely<00:05:02.100> result<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
here this is most likely result of the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.900 
here this is most likely result of the
indominus<00:05:03.450> rex<00:05:04.160> smashing<00:05:05.160> into<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.430> aviary

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
indominus rex smashing into the aviary

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.390 
indominus rex smashing into the aviary
but<00:05:06.900> it<00:05:07.020> looks<00:05:07.200> good<00:05:07.410> I'm<00:05:07.620> happy<00:05:07.650> with<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.130> the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
but it looks good I'm happy with it the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.390 
but it looks good I'm happy with it the
Pteranodon<00:05:08.970> looks<00:05:09.750> fine<00:05:10.200> and<00:05:10.620> then<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.950> as<00:05:11.130> it

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
Pteranodon looks fine and then it as it

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.010 
Pteranodon looks fine and then it as it
leaves<00:05:11.580> its<00:05:12.620> aviary<00:05:13.730> it's<00:05:14.730> obviously<00:05:15.540> off<00:05:15.810> to

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
leaves its aviary it's obviously off to

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
thinking that they do have control or

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.050 
thinking that they do have control or
maybe<00:05:27.690> even<00:05:27.810> Maserati<00:05:28.680> because<00:05:29.580> we<00:05:29.700> do<00:05:29.850> know

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
maybe even Maserati because we do know

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.190 
maybe even Maserati because we do know
that<00:05:30.950> Hoskins<00:05:31.950> will<00:05:32.160> definitely<00:05:32.580> have<00:05:32.790> some

that Hoskins will definitely have some

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.690 
that Hoskins will definitely have some

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.370 
sinister things going on and we're not
really<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.000> hundred<00:05:36.300> percent<00:05:36.450> sure<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:37.020> master
