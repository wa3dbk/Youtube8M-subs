00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 and with a friend from home who likes a 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.380
 grilled salt water 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 the tip today a filet there from the south 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.270
 Check it out today, I'll prepare a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.550
 delicious filet or draft slice 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.460
 the house number is on the air 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.140
 It is a very simple recipe to note that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.429
 let's use the lemon and salt counter-filet 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 thick august 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.270
 and you'll also need a skewer 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.630
 for barbecue 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 this revenue also within the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.579
 concept of consultations is for power 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 install in Bonn by 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 program which has been consulted 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 steakhouses of friends of the house that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 really does what is done within the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.440
 culture of gaucho culture so I go 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:03.710
 use a lemon that will give a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.110
 taste but idez taste 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 some regions to that used in other 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.330
 They're going to use a vinegar. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.890
 this recipe is a recipe that I will 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 use the language 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.450
 logically the friend of the house must be 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.189
 strange is the suggestion for protein pro 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.970
 Preparation is a piece of the dope 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.720
 as a whole is what it says on tv 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 barbecue are numerous and many 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.170
 suggestions 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:48.329
 The goal of the home friend is to have the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:52.229
 notion and the concept of how to's here 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:57.540
 already fly take full advantage i will do 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:02.869
 two put two or to power is 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.869
 serving as if it were 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.350
 as if it were really served 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:24.799
 and salt rooms August thick that same 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:33.260
 concept at the time you serve 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:36.200
 we're going to hit here calm excess 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.730
 it will not get too salty on my friend 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.730
 the gauchos taught us 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.879
 which is the concept then that we 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.349
 we would have in relation to their culture 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.160
 a concern we have in relation to 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:02.459
 to coarse salt fine salt in the cultural south 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.049
 or other major regions of the country salt 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:10.110
 fine the oprah we in the preparation will not 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.840
 make no difference in the result of the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.420
 dish acton the concern we are 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.480
 actually following some people 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.500
 They love the salt and it really 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.769
 barbecue barbeque culture gaucho 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.989
 gave a little time to get the taste of 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:34.470
 lemon and let's do in half moon system 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.360
 in the system to serve pâté ando né 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.660
 the procedure 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.489
 Look what a beauty he's going to catch me 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:50.069
 the same procedure 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:53.879
 we will be using the side 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.200
 some have a habit of holding on to 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.810
 belly né 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.519
 now they do so in that system 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:10.799
 Here O Green pulls other two forms here 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:16.859
 to separate a little bit here taking 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:19.560
 concern for the barbecue are you 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:25.020
 would have to leave a small space between 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.110
 to the two pieces so that one is able to 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.650
 to go through the same and the other so that 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.690
 be locked when you hit salt 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.370
 And then a person, right? 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.050
 or you same time it is taking 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.770
 just that piece he'll be 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.380
 with an excess salt and we already voted 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:49.250
 out of the house our against is already 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:54.750
 Ready, look what you hit to get the 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:57.659
 salt we do before making the cut 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.750
 friend, I 'll tell you guys 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.039
 following which is the same as the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.360
 steakhouse 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:09.780
 We'll take the first cuts with 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:16.639
 she exactly to the point and the center one 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:20.389
 or look at a friend from home who 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:26.479
 how wonderful 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:31.970
 this side also already succulent oó 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.970
 juicy and to the point 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:44.760
 Oh well, the side of here, too, right? 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:49.560
 pick up the top is just that 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.290
 concept that we receive right 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.880
 and all these of these 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:01.230
 entrepreneurs who came is Brazil apart 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.890
 and even and even in other countries 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.910
 with that with this very cool culture 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:13.650
 that really people who do not like 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:16.470
 of 11 the meat a roast on the whim that 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.820
 we will do with this other with this 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:23.430
 another with that other piece that 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.880
 being so past because you see that the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.070
 passers are walking with the skewers 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.550
 and in a little while they return 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.550
 they will do 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:41.520
 turns to the barbecue grill and so is 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:43.389
 a process that we are when we are in 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.740
 fraternization is within a 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.740
 steakhouse people do not observe 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.050
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.630
 today's recipe and even barbecue has 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.180
 much more want to see more revenue 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.170
 how is it here now if you want a 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.340
 come back in time a lot of peace 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.340
