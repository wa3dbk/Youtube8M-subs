I<00:00:36.420> wish<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.440> would<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> different<00:00:37.890> bio<00:00:38.190> for

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I wish they would do a different bio for

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
I wish they would do a different bio for
like<00:00:38.640> each<00:00:39.030> ability<00:00:39.440> but<00:00:41.239> thankfully<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
like each ability but thankfully that is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.100 
like each ability but thankfully that is
sad<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.850> figure<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> only<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
sad now this figure is the only way to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.920 
sad now this figure is the only way to
get<00:00:46.379> him<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.219> pack<00:00:47.690> unfortunately<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
get him with this pack unfortunately and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.439 
get him with this pack unfortunately and
it<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.070> unfortunate<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:50.969> really

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it is unfortunate because he really

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.729 
it is unfortunate because he really
didn't<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.199> there's<00:00:52.530> one

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
didn't use is I think there's one

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.850 
didn't use is I think there's one
episode<00:00:53.149> we<00:00:54.149> did<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.379> he<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.680> in

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
episode we did use this but he was in

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.700 
episode we did use this but he was in
space<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.090> he<00:00:57.120> decided<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.410> one

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
space so he decided because that one

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.799 
space so he decided because that one
episode<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> give<00:01:00.090> him<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.300> spacesuit

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
episode they had to give him a spacesuit

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.950 
episode they had to give him a spacesuit
they<00:01:00.989> couldn't<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.379> use<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.920> normal<00:01:02.160> figure

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
they couldn't just use a normal figure

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.050 
they couldn't just use a normal figure
but<00:01:03.960> um<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.040> actually<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.519> nice<00:01:05.729> toy

I<00:01:06.210> really<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.159> because<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> does<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> lot

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

when<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> rotate<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.540> piece<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.409> we

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
when you rotate it up this piece here we

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
when you rotate it up this piece here we
don't<00:01:59.399> move<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.579> arms<00:01:59.969> will<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.570> caught<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
don't move the arms will get caught you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.280 
don't move the arms will get caught you
gotta<00:02:01.890> force<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.610> causing<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> piece<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> get

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
gotta force it causing this piece to get

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.359 
gotta force it causing this piece to get
stuck<00:02:04.850> now<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> reason<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.899> because

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
stuck now the reason this is is because

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
stuck now the reason this is is because
when<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> turn<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.050> actually

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
when you turn this you can actually

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.850 
when you turn this you can actually
unsink<00:02:11.250> them

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.619 

okay<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:15.910> can't<00:02:16.269> get<00:02:16.390> them<00:02:16.480> off

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
okay so you can't get them off

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.449 
okay so you can't get them off
synchronized<00:02:17.200> which<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.830> interesting

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
synchronized which is interesting

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.509 
synchronized which is interesting
because<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:20.140> should<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.220> piece

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
because they should be just one piece

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.699 
because they should be just one piece
molded<00:02:22.150> together<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:22.780> no<00:02:22.900> that's<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> little

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
molded together but no that's a little

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.880 
molded together but no that's a little
interesting<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:25.239> um<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:26.379> can<00:02:26.560> get<00:02:26.739> them<00:02:26.860> to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
interesting but um you can get them to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.500 
interesting but um you can get them to
go<00:02:27.129> up<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.599> course<00:02:28.780> due<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.620> fact<00:02:29.920> of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
go up and of course due to the fact of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.869 
go up and of course due to the fact of
aerodynamics<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.750> propulsion<00:02:32.549> you'll<00:02:33.549> fight

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
aerodynamics and propulsion you'll fight

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.229 
aerodynamics and propulsion you'll fight
this<00:02:34.360> way<00:02:34.629> now<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.370> know<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.700> used<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.090> fly

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
this way now and you know if used to fly

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.059 
this way now and you know if used to fly
here<00:02:37.569> like<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.989> like<00:02:38.049> you<00:02:38.290> normally<00:02:38.500> does

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
here like this like you normally does

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.839 
here like this like you normally does
you'll<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:39.760> up<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.540> um<00:02:40.980> yeah<00:02:41.980> now<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:42.730> all

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
you'll just go up but um yeah now we all

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.460 
you'll just go up but um yeah now we all
know<00:02:43.030> him<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.420> show<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:44.019> when<00:02:44.170> he<00:02:44.319> would

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
know him in the show that when he would

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.009 
know him in the show that when he would
do<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:45.239> from<00:02:46.239> here<00:02:46.510> would<00:02:46.660> shoot<00:02:46.900> these

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
do this from here would shoot these

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.910 
do this from here would shoot these
massive<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:48.250> pieces<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.030> metal<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.799> you

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
massive like pieces of metal and if you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.140 
massive like pieces of metal and if you
know<00:02:51.099> if<00:02:51.280> you've<00:02:51.430> seen<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> show<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> know

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
know if you've seen the show you know

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.039 
know if you've seen the show you know
what<00:02:52.239> I'm<00:02:52.329> talking<00:02:52.569> about<00:02:52.599> it's<00:02:52.780> hard<00:02:52.959> to

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
what I'm talking about it's hard to

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.720 
what I'm talking about it's hard to
describe<00:02:53.319> but<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.980> would<00:02:54.069> do<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.370> now

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
describe but it would do that now

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.370 
describe but it would do that now
the<00:02:54.910> toy<00:02:55.180> obviously<00:02:55.630> doesn't<00:02:55.900> do<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:56.170> it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the toy obviously doesn't do that but it

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.759 
the toy obviously doesn't do that but it
has<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> really<00:02:57.280> nice<00:02:57.400> feature<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.769> can

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
has a really nice feature that I'm I can

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.309 
has a really nice feature that I'm I can
do<00:02:59.890> now<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.340> know<00:03:00.459> it's<00:03:00.819> right<00:03:01.060> here<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.840> these

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
do now you know it's right here is these

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.479 
do now you know it's right here is these
little<00:03:02.650> pieces<00:03:03.069> here<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.489> push<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
little pieces here now you push that and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.930 
little pieces here now you push that and
out<00:03:06.489> pops<00:03:07.349> one<00:03:08.349> of<00:03:08.470> these<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:09.610> they<00:03:09.849> are

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
out pops one of these this they are

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.819 
out pops one of these this they are
orange<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.629> to<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> generator<00:03:11.530> works

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
orange just to have the generator works

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.119 
orange just to have the generator works
logo<00:03:12.099> it's<00:03:12.670> pretty<00:03:12.910> much<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.150> logo<00:03:14.129> it's

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
logo it's pretty much the logo it's

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.059 
logo it's pretty much the logo it's
behind<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.670> name<00:03:15.849> yeah<00:03:16.629> it's<00:03:17.139> just<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.709> low

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
behind the name yeah it's just a low

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.309 
behind the name yeah it's just a low
gear<00:03:18.400> which<00:03:18.730> is<00:03:18.940> actually<00:03:19.299> pretty<00:03:19.450> nice<00:03:19.630> you

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
gear which is actually pretty nice you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.920 
gear which is actually pretty nice you
get<00:03:20.440> for<00:03:20.680> these<00:03:20.829> two<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.700> each<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.299> these<00:03:22.630> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
get for these two in each of these and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.860 
get for these two in each of these and
they<00:03:23.019> both<00:03:23.290> fire<00:03:26.579> okay<00:03:29.130> yeah<00:03:30.130> like<00:03:30.400> far<00:03:30.870> these

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
they both fire okay yeah like far these

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.569 
they both fire okay yeah like far these
things<00:03:32.139> have<00:03:32.319> some<00:03:32.500> really<00:03:32.829> nice<00:03:33.040> kick<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.400> it

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
things have some really nice kick to it

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.990 
things have some really nice kick to it
I<00:03:33.730> really<00:03:34.239> like<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:35.280> misfires<00:03:36.280> very<00:03:36.760> well

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
I really like this misfires very well

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.420 
I really like this misfires very well
very<00:03:37.480> nice<00:03:37.750> now<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.590> roll<00:03:38.829> them<00:03:39.040> up<00:03:39.099> what<00:03:39.310> you

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
very nice now to roll them up what you

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.000 
very nice now to roll them up what you
have<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.819> do<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.329> open<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.349> little<00:03:41.680> piece

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
have to do is you open this little piece

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.159 
have to do is you open this little piece
here<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.910> notice<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.359> swinging<00:03:43.750> apart<00:03:44.049> in

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
here and you notice is swinging apart in

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.860 
here and you notice is swinging apart in
here<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.620> pushes<00:03:44.919> this<00:03:45.310> down<00:03:45.609> so<00:03:46.480> even<00:03:46.750> when

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
here that pushes this down so even when

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.940 
here that pushes this down so even when
it's<00:03:46.989> upside<00:03:47.139> down<00:03:47.290> it'll<00:03:47.620> still<00:03:47.799> work

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
it's upside down it'll still work

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.580 
it's upside down it'll still work
you<00:03:48.459> drop<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.819> disc<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.239> close<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.019> let<00:03:50.560> it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
you drop the disc in close it let it

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.409 
you drop the disc in close it let it
clip<00:03:50.829> in<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.160> you're<00:03:51.310> ready<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.609> float<00:03:51.819> you

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
clip in and you're ready to float you

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:53.789 
clip in and you're ready to float you
know<00:03:52.480> fire<00:03:52.720> you're<00:03:53.079> just<00:03:53.200> pushing<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:53.650> to

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
know fire you're just pushing here to

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.690 
know fire you're just pushing here to
fire<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.900> what<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.220> really
