00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.840
Hey you, it's a brand new day, everybody's
here to laugh and play.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Everybody sing Humf!

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.159
Everybody sing Humf!

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.360
Wallace and Loon, Uncle Hairy too

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.540
My mum and my dad are all there with me and you.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.300
Everybody sing Humf!

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.940
Uncle Hairy's Magic

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.010
Hello Humf

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.460
Uncle Hairy!

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:06.740
One day, Uncle Hairy came to have lunch with
Humf and his mum and dad. Humf loved his Uncle Hairy

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.640
Oh Humf, I think you have a penny behind your
ear. Let me take a look, hmm.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.329
How did you do that?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.600
Magic!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.001
Mum, Dad, look! Uncle Hairy is magic!

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.459
Is he really?

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.659
Yes! He found a penny behind my ear.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.780
Does my dad have any pennies behind his ears?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.790
No, your dad just has a bit of dirt behind
his ears.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.200
Okay Hairy.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.140
But your mum does!

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.479
Oh see, he is magic mum.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.129
Where did you learn to do that anyway Hairy?

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:04.969
Ok everybody, lunch is ready.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.720
If you want to see Uncle Hairy do some more
magic Humf, just watch how much food he can make disappear.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.300
Silly dad.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.180
Sometimes Humf's dad was very silly.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.260
After lunch, Humf's friends Wallace and Loon came to play

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.600
and Humf's mum and dad and Uncle Hairy
all sat in the sitting room and talked.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.380
And Humf and his friends went to play in his
room.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.790
My Uncle Hairy is magic, he found a penny
behind my ear.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.500
A real penny?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.560
Yes.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.790
Real magic men wear hats and they have magic wands.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.900
I'm going to be a magic man.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.580
Finding a penny is not real magic, that's
just a trick.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.400
Look at my hat.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.900
I'm going to be a magic man too!

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:26.530
Real magic men make rabbits come out of hats
and they make people disappear too.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.990
I'm going to make Mr. Puppy come out of a
hat.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.860
My Uncle Hairy IS magic. He is. He is.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.940
Look at me, look at me.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.900
You are magic really, aren't you Uncle Hairy?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.740
Make me disappear, make me disappear!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.900
Okay. Ta-da! Wallace has disappeared.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.320
That's not magic! He's behind you.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.640
Oops.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.780
See, there he is.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.620
Wow! Loon, you must be magic too. You brought
Wallace back.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.360
Loon has a magic wand.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.389
Does she?

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.920
Yes Uncle Hairy and it has a star on it and
it's sparkly.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.330
But it's not a real magic wand, it's only
a pretend one.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.020
Oh, that's a shame.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.450
Uncle Hairy can you make a penny come out
from behind Loon's ear?

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.160
No Humf, I'm sorry, but Loon doesn't have
any pennies behind her ears.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.750
See! He's not a real magic man.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.090
But Loon does have a penny under her wing!

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.550
No I don't.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.580
Not that wing, this one!

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.680
Yay!

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.630
Yay!

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.620
How did you do that?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.150
Magic!

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.680
Magic, magic, magic, magic.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.320
He is magic Humf!

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.890
I know. You are magic a little bit aren't
you Uncle Hairy.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:45.710
Maybe a little bit. Goodbye Humf. I have to
go home now. See you soon! Goodbye everybody!

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.150
Bye, bye!

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.390
Bye Hairy!

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.630
See you soon!

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.600
And now for my next trick, I'm going to make
myself disappear.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.660
You are?

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:06.280
Oh yes, Alakazam! I've disappeared.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.000
There he is.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.220
Bye! Bye!

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.139
He is magic a little bit. Alakazam!

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:40.999
And Humf and Loon and Wallace all played being magic for the rest of the afternoon. Alakazam!
