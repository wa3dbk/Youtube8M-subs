00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
else I don't know I'm beginning to think

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.430 
else I don't know I'm beginning to think
that<00:04:08.400> he<00:04:08.580> isn't<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:09.030> work<00:04:09.060> late<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:09.990> in<00:04:10.260> his

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
that he isn't at work late but is in his

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.890 
that he isn't at work late but is in his
lab<00:04:10.680> instead<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.550> am<00:04:12.150> guessing<00:04:12.450> that's<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
lab instead I am guessing that's the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.680 
lab instead I am guessing that's the
case<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.530> should<00:04:14.400> have<00:04:14.820> figured<00:04:15.030> he<00:04:15.300> was<00:04:15.420> lying

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
case I should have figured he was lying

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.110 
case I should have figured he was lying
I<00:04:16.170> just<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.770> know<00:04:16.890> why<00:04:17.130> he<00:04:17.370> has<00:04:17.550> to<00:04:17.700> hide<00:04:17.970> it

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
I just don't know why he has to hide it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.590 
I just don't know why he has to hide it
from<00:04:18.150> me<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:19.440> should<00:04:19.830> confront<00:04:20.220> him<00:04:20.550> it<00:04:21.420> was

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
from me you should confront him it was

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.870 
from me you should confront him it was
hard<00:04:21.840> enough<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.020> talk<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> my<00:04:22.590> mom<00:04:22.800> I'll<00:04:23.640> ask
