four-in-one connection kit this is

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.259 
four-in-one connection kit this is
actually<00:00:10.530> pretty<00:00:10.800> old<00:00:10.830> when<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> used<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.090> own

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
actually pretty old when I used to own

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
actually pretty old when I used to own
Samsung<00:00:13.200> Galaxy<00:00:13.559> s2<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.940> bought<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.450> one

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
Samsung Galaxy s2 and I bought this one

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.140 
Samsung Galaxy s2 and I bought this one
the<00:00:16.470> reason<00:00:16.740> why<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.070> called<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.789> four<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the reason why it is called a four in

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.730 
the reason why it is called a four in
one<00:00:18.330> connection<00:00:18.600> kit<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.439> gives<00:00:19.680> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
one connection kit because it gives you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670 
one connection kit because it gives you
four<00:00:20.010> different<00:00:20.609> connections<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:22.050> will<00:00:22.289> give

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
four different connections it will give

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.000 
four different connections it will give
you<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.269> full<00:00:24.269> size<00:00:24.480> USB<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:25.939> microUSB<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:28.010> card

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you a full size USB a microUSB a card

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
you a full size USB a microUSB a card
reader<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.609> micro<00:00:29.939> SD<00:00:30.210> card<00:00:30.480> reader<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
reader which is micro SD card reader and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.819 
reader which is micro SD card reader and
the<00:00:31.410> SD<00:00:31.800> card<00:00:32.730> reader<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.180> bigger<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.829> so

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the SD card reader the bigger one so

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
the SD card reader the bigger one so
let's<00:00:35.340> try<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.780> whether<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:37.170> work

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
let's try this whether this will work

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.450 
let's try this whether this will work
with<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.980> s4<00:00:38.820> or<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.050> let's<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
with the s4 or not so let's see as you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
with the s4 or not so let's see as you
can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:46.100> s4<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.430> powered<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.450> let<00:00:48.600> me

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
can see the s4 is powered on so let me

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.010 
can see the s4 is powered on so let me
connect<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:54.329> light<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.840> on

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
connect with this one the light is on

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.500 
connect with this one the light is on
and<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> says<00:00:55.680> USB<00:00:56.160> connector<00:00:56.520> connected<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and it says USB connector connected so

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
and it says USB connector connected so
it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> detecting<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.609> no<00:00:59.760> problem

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it is detecting this one so no problem

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
it is detecting this one so no problem
whatsoever<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.710> your

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
whatsoever if so if you don't have your

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
whatsoever if so if you don't have your
USB<00:01:02.430> OTG<00:01:02.789> cable<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:04.049> connector<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.860> also

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
USB OTG cable this connector will also

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.990 
USB OTG cable this connector will also
work<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.640> USB<00:01:06.270> OTG<00:01:06.689> cable<00:01:07.490> because<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.790> has

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
work as USB OTG cable because this has

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.469 
work as USB OTG cable because this has
the<00:01:09.270> USB<00:01:10.140> port<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:12.000> still

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the USB port here so you can still

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.719 
the USB port here so you can still
connect<00:01:12.900> any<00:01:13.170> USB<00:01:13.860> device<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:16.159> your<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.700> far

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
connect any USB device with your as far
