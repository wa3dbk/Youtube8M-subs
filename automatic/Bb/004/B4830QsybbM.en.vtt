talking about battery switches and why
you<00:00:17.100> would<00:00:17.400> select<00:00:17.580> different<00:00:18.119> switches<00:00:18.480> for

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
you would select different switches for

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
battery 2 why is that a problem in an

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.340 
battery 2 why is that a problem in an
old<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> old<00:00:48.180> days<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.720> when<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.230> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
old in the old days and when we have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
old in the old days and when we have
boats<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.280> electronics<00:00:50.880> on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
boats that don't have electronics on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
boats that don't have electronics on
them<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.470> problem<00:00:52.610> these<00:00:53.610> days

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
them not so much of a problem these days

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.460 
them not so much of a problem these days
we've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> lot<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> electronics<00:00:55.200> and<00:00:55.410> they

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
we've got a lot of electronics and they

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.709 
we've got a lot of electronics and they
are<00:00:55.590> sensitive<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.579> voltage<00:00:56.940> spikes<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
are sensitive to voltage spikes and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.690 
are sensitive to voltage spikes and
voltage<00:00:58.050> surges<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.550> have

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
voltage surges so when we have

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.459 
voltage surges so when we have
everything<00:01:00.059> connected<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> single<00:01:00.989> battery

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
everything connected to a single battery

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
everything connected to a single battery
and<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:01.980> crank<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> main<00:01:02.790> engine<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and we crank over the main engine in a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600 
and we crank over the main engine in a
lot<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> cases<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.680> fishfinder<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.460> other

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
lot of cases the fishfinder or other

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539 
lot of cases the fishfinder or other
electronics<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.420> shut<00:01:06.689> down<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> idea<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
electronics will shut down the idea is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
electronics will shut down the idea is
to<00:01:08.729> make<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.060> stop<00:01:09.299> happening<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.990> give<00:01:10.380> us

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to make that stop happening and give us

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.359 
to make that stop happening and give us
reserve<00:01:10.950> power<00:01:11.929> for<00:01:12.929> the<00:01:13.439> main<00:01:13.590> engine<00:01:13.829> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
reserve power for the main engine the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
reserve power for the main engine the
other<00:01:14.459> issue<00:01:14.759> that<00:01:14.880> takes<00:01:15.209> place<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
other issue that takes place here is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
other issue that takes place here is
that<00:01:16.289> when<00:01:16.439> you're<00:01:16.590> switched<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:16.950> battery<00:01:17.100> 1

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that when you're switched to battery 1

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.279 
that when you're switched to battery 1
and<00:01:17.969> you've<00:01:18.119> got<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.359> downriggers<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
and you've got your downriggers up to

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.649 
and you've got your downriggers up to
battery<00:01:19.649> -<00:01:19.859> you<00:01:20.579> can<00:01:20.759> be<00:01:20.850> running<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.240> engine

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
battery - you can be running your engine

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.349 
battery - you can be running your engine
but<00:01:22.289> not<00:01:22.469> charging<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.189> battery<00:01:23.609> so<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
but not charging this battery so you

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.870 
but not charging this battery so you
have<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> exact<00:01:24.899> idea<00:01:25.229> -<00:01:25.679> or<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.249> possibility

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
have the exact idea - or the possibility

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.779 
have the exact idea - or the possibility
to<00:01:27.229> discharge<00:01:28.229> both<00:01:28.740> batteries<00:01:29.219> completely

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
to discharge both batteries completely

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.699 
to discharge both batteries completely

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.529 
main engine to the bottom terminal the H
is<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.219> house<00:01:56.369> battery<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.389> would

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
is for the house battery that would

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.510 
is for the house battery that would
connect<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> two<00:01:58.139> and<00:01:58.740> everything<00:01:59.159> else<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
connect to two and everything else on

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.399 
connect to two and everything else on
the<00:01:59.639> boat<00:01:59.819> would<00:02:00.029> run<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.929> this<00:02:01.139> terminal

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the boat would run from this terminal

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.099 
the boat would run from this terminal
except<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.429> automobiles<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.329> devices<00:02:03.929> that

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
except the automobiles or devices that

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.440 
except the automobiles or devices that
require<00:02:04.319> constant<00:02:04.770> battery<00:02:05.130> power<00:02:05.429> so<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
require constant battery power so the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.120 
require constant battery power so the
idea<00:02:06.779> is<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.349> get<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.709> boat<00:02:07.919> you

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
idea is when you get in the boat you

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.440 
idea is when you get in the boat you
turn<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> switch<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:08.819> off<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.060> on

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
turn a switch from off to on

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.440 
turn a switch from off to on
it<00:02:10.110> connects<00:02:10.790> simultaneously<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.150> engine

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
it connects simultaneously the engine

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.540 
it connects simultaneously the engine
