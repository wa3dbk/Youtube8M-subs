00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
frameworks and it was safe and it would

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
frameworks and it was safe and it would
function<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:58.159> sourcing<00:01:58.610> motors<00:01:58.969> and

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
so I was pretty fun and hopefully this

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.119 
so I was pretty fun and hopefully this
is<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.439> improvement<00:03:02.439> upon<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.739> isn't<00:03:02.980> little

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
is a improvement upon this isn't little

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.830 
is a improvement upon this isn't little
more<00:03:03.220> complicated<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> less<00:03:04.599> fire

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
more complicated but a less fire

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.199 
more complicated but a less fire
unfortunately<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:06.129> don't<00:03:06.340> want<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.730> fire<00:03:06.940> this

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209
