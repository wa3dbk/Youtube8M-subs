00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
with at Manchester United over the last

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.240 
with at Manchester United over the last
ten<00:01:53.880> years<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:58.380> hard<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> say<00:01:58.890> there's<00:01:59.130> so

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
many great players and I think that's a

many great players and I think that's a
obviously<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> forwards<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:05.909> play

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
obviously with all the forwards of play

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.570 
obviously with all the forwards of play
with<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:07.100> probably<00:02:08.100> say<00:02:08.310> me<00:02:08.460> best<00:02:10.580> partnership

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
things which in my eyes anyway Messi is

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.050 
things which in my eyes anyway Messi is
the<00:03:59.760> best<00:03:59.850> ever<00:04:00.800> what<00:04:01.800> makes<00:04:02.070> him<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.610> little

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
the best ever what makes him a little

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.210 
the best ever what makes him a little
bit<00:04:03.300> better<00:04:03.450> than<00:04:03.690> Ronaldo<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.620> indeed<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.100> is

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
bit better than Ronaldo if indeed it is

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.630 
bit better than Ronaldo if indeed it is
a<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:06.060> bit<00:04:06.209> what<00:04:06.390> makes<00:04:06.570> him<00:04:06.720> better<00:04:07.110> I

a little bit what makes him better I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.890 
a little bit what makes him better I
