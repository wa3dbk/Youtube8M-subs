doesn't<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> GPS<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.910> think<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
doesn't have GPS and I think this is

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
others so like I think photographic

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.299

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
connection cable charger and we've got a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.180

battery<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.209> charge<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.680> camera

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
battery this one charge is in camera

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.190 
battery this one charge is in camera
just<00:02:47.430> like<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> USB<00:02:48.090> connection<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.840> mobile

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
just like a USB connection to a mobile

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.170 
just like a USB connection to a mobile
phone<00:02:49.470> would<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.100> uses<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.959> X<00:02:51.959> type<00:02:52.470> battery

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
phone would it uses the X type battery

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.330 
phone would it uses the X type battery
which<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.540> same<00:02:55.140> used<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.860> rx100

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
which is the same used in like the rx100

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.390 
which is the same used in like the rx100
and<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.930> few<00:02:58.200> other<00:02:58.500> things<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.040> previous

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
and a few other things in the previous

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.220 
and a few other things in the previous
version<00:02:59.760> as<00:02:59.850> well<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.660> nice<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.870> they

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
version as well so it's nice that they

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.050 
version as well so it's nice that they
haven't<00:03:01.650> brought<00:03:02.010> out<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> new<00:03:02.459> battery<00:03:02.670> just

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
haven't brought out a new battery just

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.720 
haven't brought out a new battery just
to<00:03:03.150> annoy<00:03:03.360> us<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.680> then<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.070> also<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:07.730> we're

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to annoy us and then you also get we're

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.509 
to annoy us and then you also get we're
all<00:03:08.880> here<00:03:09.180> let's<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.900> honest<00:03:10.260> isn't<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.800> so

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
all here let's be honest isn't it so

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.800 
all here let's be honest isn't it so
let's<00:03:11.850> take<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.090> out<00:03:12.890> okay<00:03:13.920> first<00:03:14.820> impressions

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
let's take it out okay first impressions

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.819 
let's take it out okay first impressions
is<00:03:16.489> it's<00:03:17.489> nice<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.000> small<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.829> smaller

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
is it's nice and small and smaller

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.100 
is it's nice and small and smaller
certainly<00:03:20.400> than<00:03:20.579> mate<00:03:20.760> x<00:03:20.970> 60<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.720> designed

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
certainly than mate x 60 it's designed

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.180 
certainly than mate x 60 it's designed
really<00:03:22.560> well<00:03:22.950> actually<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.090> sort<00:03:24.630> of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
really well actually I like the sort of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.800 
really well actually I like the sort of
line<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> top<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.120> below<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.780> I

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
line on the top and then below and I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.800 
line on the top and then below and I
wonder<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.410> they<00:03:28.620> do<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.370> silver<00:03:30.239> version<00:03:30.390> there

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
wonder if they do a silver version there

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.050 
wonder if they do a silver version there
so<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.200> looks<00:03:31.380> really<00:03:31.739> smart<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.459> silver<00:03:32.970> if

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
so that looks really smart in silver if

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.470 
so that looks really smart in silver if
they<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.579> this<00:03:35.730> comparison

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
they do and so think of this comparison

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.360 
they do and so think of this comparison
to<00:03:37.730> Panasonic's<00:03:38.730> t-there<00:03:39.410> 70<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.860> newest<00:03:41.160> one

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
to Panasonic's t-there 70 the newest one

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.840 
to Panasonic's t-there 70 the newest one
so<00:03:41.579> viewfinder<00:03:42.329> 30<00:03:42.660> x<00:03:43.019> oom<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.709> good<00:03:44.610> build

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
so viewfinder 30 x oom and good build

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.350 
so viewfinder 30 x oom and good build
quality

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
quality

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.509 
quality
I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.930> price-wise<00:03:46.290> they're<00:03:47.130> about<00:03:47.340> the

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
I think price-wise they're about the

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.170 
I think price-wise they're about the
same<00:03:47.760> Panasonic's<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.780> about<00:03:49.640> 330<00:03:50.640> this<00:03:51.090> is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
same Panasonic's is about 330 this is

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.900 
same Panasonic's is about 330 this is
about<00:03:51.299> 330<00:03:52.019> but<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.920> some<00:03:53.220> places<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.670> get<00:03:53.880> a

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
about 330 but in some places you get a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.390 
about 330 but in some places you get a
free<00:03:54.150> leather<00:03:54.390> case<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.110> which<00:03:55.950> makes<00:03:56.190> it

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
free leather case and which makes it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.270 
free leather case and which makes it
worthwhile<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.560> let's<00:03:58.739> take<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.920> little<00:03:59.070> look

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
worthwhile so let's take a little look

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.860 
worthwhile so let's take a little look
around<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.549> so<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.880> zoom<00:04:00.360> ring<00:04:00.810> on<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:02.459> lens

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
around it so the zoom ring on the lens

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.390 
around it so the zoom ring on the lens
rotates<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.079> you<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.320> use<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.650> for<00:04:04.920> control

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
rotates so you can use that for control

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.210 
rotates so you can use that for control
in<00:04:05.640> different<00:04:06.000> features<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:07.160> controlling<00:04:08.160> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
in different features so controlling the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.890 
in different features so controlling the
zoom<00:04:08.400> control<00:04:08.640> aperture<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.359> chef<00:04:09.570> speed

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
zoom control aperture and chef speed

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.319 
zoom control aperture and chef speed
everything<00:04:10.320> like<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.859> on<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.640> top<00:04:11.850> you've

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
everything like that on the top you've

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.540

grippy<00:06:30.850> bit<00:06:31.030> there<00:06:32.070> which<00:06:33.070> is<00:06:33.220> a<00:06:33.340> I<00:06:33.660> think<00:06:34.660> for

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
grippy bit there which is a I think for

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.240 
grippy bit there which is a I think for
people<00:06:34.960> of<00:06:35.229> smaller<00:06:35.530> hands<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:35.979> wouldn't<00:06:36.190> be

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
people of smaller hands it wouldn't be

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.670 
people of smaller hands it wouldn't be
such<00:06:36.430> an<00:06:36.550> issue<00:06:36.780> kind<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:37.960> makes<00:06:38.139> a<00:06:38.290> little<00:06:38.320> bit

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
such an issue kind of makes a little bit

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.550 
such an issue kind of makes a little bit
of<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.830> difference<00:06:39.250> let's<00:06:40.240> flip<00:06:40.780> on<00:06:40.990> using<00:06:41.380> the

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
of a difference let's flip on using the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.510 
of a difference let's flip on using the
viewfinder<00:06:42.100> stick<00:06:42.610> we<00:06:42.760> popped<00:06:43.000> it<00:06:43.090> up<00:06:44.490> pull<00:06:45.490> it

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
viewfinder stick we popped it up pull it

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.240 
viewfinder stick we popped it up pull it
out<00:06:45.729> that's<00:06:46.510> powered<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:47.020> on<00:06:47.139> then<00:06:47.830> it's<00:06:48.010> got

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
out that's powered it on then it's got

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.310 
out that's powered it on then it's got
an<00:06:48.370> automatic<00:06:48.639> sensor<00:06:49.419> so<00:06:49.630> the<00:06:49.750> screen<00:06:50.050> will

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
an automatic sensor so the screen will

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.110 
an automatic sensor so the screen will
come<00:06:50.440> on<00:06:50.650> and<00:06:50.800> go<00:06:50.889> off<00:06:51.040> you<00:06:51.190> can<00:06:51.370> see<00:06:51.580> there<00:06:51.790> did

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
come on and go off you can see there did

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:03.170 
come on and go off you can see there did
I<00:06:52.330> forget<00:06:52.900> too<00:06:53.050> that<00:06:53.080> if<00:06:53.710> I<00:06:53.949> put<00:06:54.340> up<00:06:54.520> the<00:06:55.530> lens
