00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.060
 we are done with the rules 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.710
 general and we will now see 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.240
 the rules that apply specifically 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.620
 to sight flights whatever you 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.480
 practice during your training 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.040
 initial 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.290
 except for special vfr flights 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.330
 steal them vfr are carried out in 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.369
 visibility and distance conditions 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.310
 in relation to the clouds at least equal to 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.960
 the one you just saw the vfr 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.910
 special is an authorization from the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.579
 control to evolve below the minima 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.890
 vmc to know when the ceiling is 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.100
 less than 1500 feet or when the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.449
 visibility is less than 5 km 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.640
 attention you are always limited by 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.399
 the minimum value of 1500 m or 30 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.469
 flight seconds the special vfr can only 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.539
 be allowed only in the zone of 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.230
 aerodrome control outside the 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.940
 conditions vmc just apply 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.010
 unless authorized by the authority 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.109
 competent vfr flights are not 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.420
 performed above the flight level 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.089
 two hundred at transfo speeds nick 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.240
 is supersonic the maximum level is 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.060
 so theoretically the fl 195 however 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 on specific authorization a bfr can 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.250
 fly higher up to flight level 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.050
 290 to be quite accurate the flights 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.700
 vfr could be allowed again 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.320
 above but the procedures for 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.970
 separation applied in Europe and a 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.330
 little anywhere in the world that's called 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.890
 herv sm forbid the rvsn allows 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.960
 to airliners to be separated 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 vertically from 1000 feet only to 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.860
 place 2000 feet above level 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.390
 of flight 281 5 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.980
 as you can see all this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.570
 is purely theoretical because it is not 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.680
 with a light aircraft the aero club that you 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.210
 go hang out there up there 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.580
 the flights had to do are not 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.900
 allowed over areas with strong 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.280
 density of cities or other 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.230
 gathering agglomerations 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.300
 outdoor people under 300 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.040
 meters 1000 feet above 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.070
 the highest obstacle located in a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.020
 radius of 600 meters around the aircraft 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.420
 elsewhere at a height less than 150 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.240
 meters 500 feet above the ground or 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
 the water however the gliders performing 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.640
 slope flights 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.440
 as well as balloons and gliders 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.450
 ultra light can fly less than 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.800
 500 feet subject to training 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.510
 no risk to people or 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.040
 property on the surface 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.110
 on the other hand as part of a flight 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.989
 of flight instruction this author is 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.239
 brought back to 50 meters 150 feet for 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.190
 forced landing training 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.080
 a distance of 150 meters compared to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 any person any vehicle any ship 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.680
 on the surface and any artificial obstacles 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 must be respected at all times
