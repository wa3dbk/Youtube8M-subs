00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
technically on the replays just it
looked<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> foul<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.040> it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
looked like it was a foul but it's it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.039 
looked like it was a foul but it's it's
one<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.850> those<00:01:38.909> situations<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.600> lot<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.869> times

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
one of those situations a lot of times

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
one of those situations a lot of times
those<00:01:40.229> fouls<00:01:40.470> don't<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.159> called<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.700> all

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
those fouls don't get called or all

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.940 
those fouls don't get called or all
especially<00:01:42.479> late<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> game<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.409> if

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
especially late in the game but if

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
especially late in the game but if
you're<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> by<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> book<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you're going by the book you know you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
you're going by the book you know you
could<00:01:46.380> say<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
could say would be and I think that's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
could say would be and I think that's
one<00:01:47.430> reason<00:01:47.579> why<00:01:47.759> Arizona<00:01:48.090> wasn't<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:48.750> at

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
one reason why Arizona wasn't really at

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
one reason why Arizona wasn't really at
least<00:01:49.590> publicly<00:01:49.799> complaining<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
least publicly complaining about it and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
least publicly complaining about it and
it's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.659> know<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.290> really

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's just you know it's just a really

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's just you know it's just a really
really<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:53.189> bad<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
really really bad time for that to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.740 
really really bad time for that to
happen

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
happen

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.800 
happen
sleep<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:56.190> know<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.660> that

I'm sure that I'm sure deep down they

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.290 
I'm sure that I'm sure deep down they
felt<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.580> should<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.880> been<00:02:00.000> called<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
felt they should have been called that

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.120 
felt they should have been called that
situation<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.800> it's<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.980> way<00:02:02.040> it

situation but you know it's the way it
goes<00:02:02.190> then<00:02:03.000> after<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.420> offensive<00:02:03.780> foul

Wisconsin goes to inbound turn it over
it<00:02:06.900> looked<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.830> probably<00:02:08.160> went<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.429> an

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it looked like it probably went off an

it looked like it probably went off an
Arizona<00:02:08.970> player<00:02:09.210> they<00:02:09.420> review<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.050> what

Johnson<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.040> he<00:02:17.100> kind<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.310> dribbles<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.760> out

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
Johnson but he kind of dribbles it out

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.640 
Johnson but he kind of dribbles it out
and<00:02:18.060> doesn't<00:02:18.209> get<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> shot<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:18.930> what<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:19.590> you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and doesn't get a shot up what do you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
and doesn't get a shot up what do you
think<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.950> last<00:02:20.250> possession<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.970> kind

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
think of that last possession and kind

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.120 
think of that last possession and kind
of<00:02:21.420> how<00:02:21.480> tough<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> guy<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.709> Nick

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
of how tough is that for a guy like Nick

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.100 
of how tough is that for a guy like Nick
that<00:02:23.610> could<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> last<00:02:23.940> play<00:02:24.630> he<00:02:24.750> ever<00:02:24.870> has

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that could be the last play he ever has

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.860 
that could be the last play he ever has
in<00:02:25.220> Arizona<00:02:26.220> uniform<00:02:26.610> well<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.000> wonder

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
in Arizona uniform well I wonder

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.420 
in Arizona uniform well I wonder
sometimes<00:02:27.900> about<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> monitored<00:02:29.070> thing<00:02:29.280> too

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
sometimes about the monitored thing too

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.620 
sometimes about the monitored thing too
I<00:02:29.459> mean<00:02:29.640> they<00:02:29.730> said<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.000> went<00:02:30.090> through<00:02:30.270> 14

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
I mean they said they went through 14

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.270 
I mean they said they went through 14
different<00:02:30.750> angles<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:31.920> good<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.130> all

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
different angles and that's good and all

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.449 
different angles and that's good and all
they<00:02:32.459> got<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> right<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.950> takes<00:02:35.220> away

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
they got it right but it just takes away

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.740 
they got it right but it just takes away
from<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.670> flow<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.150> game<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.390> they're

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
from the flow of the game and they're

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.240 
from the flow of the game and they're
sitting<00:02:37.080> around<00:02:37.140> waiting<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.950> waiting<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
sitting around waiting and waiting and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.130 
sitting around waiting and waiting and
waiting<00:02:38.340> oh<00:02:38.580> ok<00:02:38.940> then<00:02:39.150> 23<00:02:39.480> seconds<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.050> get

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
waiting oh ok then 23 seconds and get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.500 
waiting oh ok then 23 seconds and get
off<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> shot<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.090> maybe

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
off a shot and then so you know maybe

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.810 
off a shot and then so you know maybe
Nick<00:02:43.380> was<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> little<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.280> was<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.489> little<00:02:44.550> bit

out of his rhythm there and on the same

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.220 
out of his rhythm there and on the same
time<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.510> you're<00:02:48.720> playing<00:02:48.930> against<00:02:49.140> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
time you know you're playing against a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.690 
time you know you're playing against a
really<00:02:49.380> good<00:02:49.470> defense<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.070> they<00:02:50.220> did<00:02:50.370> they

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
really good defense and they did they

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.150 
really good defense and they did they
did<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> nice<00:02:51.150> job<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.920> with

did a nice job you know with with
following<00:02:53.550> him<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.880> then<00:02:53.970> they<00:02:54.090> had<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.239> think

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
following him and then they had I think

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.720 
following him and then they had I think
Jackson<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.410> with<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> sand<00:02:56.310> at<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.520> end

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
Jackson was up with a sand at the end

of the Final Four you know I you know

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.479 
of the Final Four you know I you know
it's<00:03:25.110> interesting<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.860> say<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.070> because<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it's interesting you say that because I

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.610 
it's interesting you say that because I
think<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.820> lot<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.299> lot<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.019> times<00:03:28.230> fans

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
think a lot of a lot of times fans

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.100 
think a lot of a lot of times fans
especially<00:03:28.890> fancy<00:03:29.549> well<00:03:30.540> i<00:03:30.570> don't<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.049> i

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
especially fancy well i don't know but i

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.900 
especially fancy well i don't know but i
think<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.620> there's<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.160> much<00:03:32.310> emphasis<00:03:32.790> on

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
think that there's so much emphasis on

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.940 
think that there's so much emphasis on
the<00:03:32.940> Final<00:03:33.360> Four<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.720> there's<00:03:34.650> going<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.920> be

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
the Final Four that there's going to be

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.530 
the Final Four that there's going to be
some<00:03:35.190> disappointment<00:03:35.760> there<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.329> people

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
some disappointment there and people

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.120 
some disappointment there and people
seem<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.900> think<00:03:37.019> at<00:03:37.290> Arizona<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:37.829> almost<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
seem to think at Arizona it's almost the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.319 
seem to think at Arizona it's almost the
point<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.459> if<00:03:38.579> they<00:03:38.700> don't<00:03:38.850> get<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
point now if they don't get there and

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.550 
point now if they don't get there and
now<00:03:39.390> they<00:03:39.510> haven't<00:03:39.690> been<00:03:39.750> there<00:03:39.840> for<00:03:39.900> 13<00:03:40.350> years

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
now they haven't been there for 13 years

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.470 
now they haven't been there for 13 years
come<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.160> when's<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.459> going<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.640> happen<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.030> if

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
come on when's it going to happen but if

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.120 
come on when's it going to happen but if
you<00:03:42.660> look<00:03:42.810> at<00:03:42.930> what<00:03:43.049> this<00:03:43.140> team<00:03:43.350> really<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.829> I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
you look at what this team really was I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.800 
you look at what this team really was I
think<00:03:44.850> they<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.000> think<00:03:45.150> they<00:03:45.420> met<00:03:45.660> their

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
think they I think they met their

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.210 
think they I think they met their
expectations<00:03:46.350> maybe<00:03:46.560> even<00:03:46.799> exceeded

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
expectations maybe even exceeded

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.500 
expectations maybe even exceeded
especially<00:03:47.670> if<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.820> consider<00:03:47.910> where<00:03:48.390> they

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
especially if you consider where they

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.509 
especially if you consider where they
were<00:03:48.570> after<00:03:48.930> they<00:03:49.140> lost<00:03:49.350> Brandon<00:03:49.950> Ashley<00:03:50.100> and

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
were after they lost Brandon Ashley and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.030 
were after they lost Brandon Ashley and
you<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:51.209> Valentine's<00:03:51.510> Day<00:03:52.110> losing<00:03:52.500> at<00:03:52.590> ASU

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
you know Valentine's Day losing at ASU

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.890 
you know Valentine's Day losing at ASU
they<00:03:53.280> look<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.000> didn't<00:03:54.480> think<00:03:54.540> they<00:03:54.780> would

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
they look like I didn't think they would

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.210 
they look like I didn't think they would
have<00:03:55.019> been<00:03:55.140> here<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> elite<00:03:56.070> eight

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
have been here in the elite eight

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.590 
have been here in the elite eight
there's<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.730> thought<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.000> would<00:03:57.030> they<00:03:57.450> look

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
there's I thought they would they look

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.120 
there's I thought they would they look
like<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.840> first<00:03:58.140> or<00:03:58.290> second-round<00:03:58.590> loss<00:03:58.829> team

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
like a first or second-round loss team

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.720 
like a first or second-round loss team
you<00:03:59.340> know<00:03:59.459> and

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
you know and

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.149 
you know and
so<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.180> think<00:04:00.810> they<00:04:01.080> had<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.560> pretty<00:04:01.739> good<00:04:01.800> season

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
so I think they had a pretty good season

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.890 
so I think they had a pretty good season
they<00:04:02.220> certainly<00:04:02.489> won<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.909> pac-12<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.599> still

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
they certainly won the pac-12 and still

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.509 
they certainly won the pac-12 and still
ran<00:04:04.080> away<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.409> it<00:04:04.530> even<00:04:04.650> without<00:04:04.890> Ashley<00:04:05.340> and

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
ran away with it even without Ashley and

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.390 
ran away with it even without Ashley and
the<00:04:06.209> way<00:04:06.330> they<00:04:06.510> kind<00:04:07.110> of<00:04:07.190> redefine<00:04:08.190> themselves

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the way they kind of redefine themselves

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.789 
the way they kind of redefine themselves
without<00:04:08.790> Ashley<00:04:09.360> playing<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.810> different<00:04:09.959> going

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
without Ashley playing a different going

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.500 
without Ashley playing a different going
deeper<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.220> rotation<00:04:11.489> playing<00:04:11.970> Gabe<00:04:12.209> York

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
deeper in the rotation playing Gabe York

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.559 
deeper in the rotation playing Gabe York
starting<00:04:12.930> him<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:14.310> then<00:04:14.459> playing<00:04:14.819> Aaron

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
starting him and and then playing Aaron

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.390 
starting him and and then playing Aaron
Gordon<00:04:15.720> at<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> four<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.919> five<00:04:17.130> where<00:04:17.280> he's

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
Gordon at the four and five where he's

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.670 
Gordon at the four and five where he's
really<00:04:17.729> super<00:04:18.060> effective<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.530> they

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
really super effective you know they

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.289 
really super effective you know they
actually<00:04:19.979> became<00:04:20.250> arguably<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:20.820> as<00:04:21.090> good<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
actually became arguably just as good a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.870 
actually became arguably just as good a
team<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:22.380> know<00:04:22.500> it'd<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:23.250> interesting<00:04:23.460> to

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
team but you know it'd be interesting to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.980 
team but you know it'd be interesting to

and getting out there on him and he had
a<00:05:06.840> couple<00:05:07.080> of<00:05:07.289> really<00:05:07.710> wide<00:05:07.979> open<00:05:08.280> looks<00:05:08.490> as<00:05:08.639> a

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
a couple of really wide open looks as a

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.029 
a couple of really wide open looks as a
result<00:05:09.060> and<00:05:09.270> that's<00:05:09.960> not<00:05:10.139> necessarily<00:05:10.470> Kaleb

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
result and that's not necessarily Kaleb

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.920

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.750 
Tarczewski fault he's he's seven foot
and<00:05:13.169> it's<00:05:13.560> tough<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.950> move<00:05:14.160> around<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.520> so

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
and it's tough to move around that so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.159 
and it's tough to move around that so
they<00:05:14.880> had<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.090> take<00:05:15.300> him<00:05:15.479> out<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.750> it<00:05:15.870> was<00:05:15.930> just

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
they had to take him out and it was just

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.170 
they had to take him out and it was just
a<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:16.740> turned<00:05:17.010> into<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.250> matchup<00:05:17.460> nightmare<00:05:17.639> but

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
a it turned into a matchup nightmare but

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.659 
a it turned into a matchup nightmare but
Kaminski<00:05:19.050> had<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.200> terrific<00:05:19.530> night<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.099> you

Kaminski had a terrific night and you
know<00:05:20.789> I<00:05:20.820> thought<00:05:21.389> when<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.599> watched<00:05:21.960> him

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
know I thought when I watched him

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.480 
know I thought when I watched him
against<00:05:22.320> baylor<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.860> other<00:05:23.010> night<00:05:23.160> he<00:05:23.370> was

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
against baylor the other night he was

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.040 
against baylor the other night he was
really<00:05:23.910> good<00:05:24.060> around<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.360> basket<00:05:24.539> he<00:05:24.900> hit<00:05:25.020> a

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
really good around the basket he hit a

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.420 
really good around the basket he hit a
couple<00:05:25.229> outside<00:05:25.620> there<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:25.979> I<00:05:26.039> thought<00:05:26.070> man

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
couple outside there and I thought man

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.190 
couple outside there and I thought man
he<00:05:26.610> could<00:05:26.729> be<00:05:26.820> trouble<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.300> use<00:05:27.810> even<00:05:28.050> better

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
he could be trouble and use even better

know<00:05:49.020> they<00:05:49.260> should<00:05:49.710> get<00:05:49.889> I<00:05:50.610> think<00:05:50.940> they're

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
know they should get I think they're

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.610 
know they should get I think they're
going<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.360> lose<00:05:51.479> two<00:05:51.810> maybe<00:05:52.169> three<00:05:52.410> guys<00:05:52.590> I

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
going to lose two maybe three guys I

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.820 
going to lose two maybe three guys I
think<00:05:53.070> probably<00:05:53.430> Nick<00:05:53.760> Johnson<00:05:54.180> and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
think probably Nick Johnson and

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.440 
think probably Nick Johnson and
Aaron<00:05:55.550> Gordon<00:05:55.670> you<00:05:55.910> have<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.180> figure<00:05:56.330> out

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
Aaron Gordon you have to figure out

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.330 
Aaron Gordon you have to figure out
probably<00:05:56.630> going<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:56.990> leave<00:05:57.110> but<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.800> know<00:05:58.190> you

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
probably going to leave but you know you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.130 
probably going to leave but you know you
never<00:05:58.430> know<00:05:58.580> for<00:05:58.880> sure<00:05:58.940> I<00:05:59.090> mean<00:05:59.570> this<00:05:59.810> time<00:06:00.020> of

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
never know for sure I mean this time of

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.600 
never know for sure I mean this time of
year<00:06:00.170> ago<00:06:00.410> we<00:06:00.560> didn't<00:06:00.740> know<00:06:00.860> grand<00:06:01.130> juried<00:06:01.460> and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
year ago we didn't know grand juried and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.130 
year ago we didn't know grand juried and
answer<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:01.970> tool<00:06:02.150> we're<00:06:02.270> gonna<00:06:02.360> leave<00:06:02.570> it<00:06:02.780> was

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
answer the tool we're gonna leave it was

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.840 
answer the tool we're gonna leave it was
just<00:06:03.320> strange<00:06:03.530> things<00:06:03.890> yeah<00:06:04.460> we<00:06:04.580> didn't<00:06:04.760> know

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
just strange things yeah we didn't know

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.100 
just strange things yeah we didn't know
Anna<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.180> gordon<00:06:05.390> was<00:06:05.480> coming<00:06:05.540> either<00:06:05.840> so

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
Anna and gordon was coming either so

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.320 
Anna and gordon was coming either so
strange<00:06:06.980> things<00:06:07.250> can<00:06:07.430> happen<00:06:07.490> in<00:06:07.880> April<00:06:08.150> and

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
strange things can happen in April and

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.990 
strange things can happen in April and
so<00:06:09.200> it's<00:06:09.380> a<00:06:09.470> much<00:06:09.620> much<00:06:10.160> easier<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.610> tell<00:06:10.790> the

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
so it's a much much easier to tell the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.550 
so it's a much much easier to tell the
end<00:06:11.120> of<00:06:11.210> april<00:06:11.300> or<00:06:11.660> in<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.810> May<00:06:11.960> what<00:06:12.440> this

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
end of april or in the May what this

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.230 
end of april or in the May what this
seems<00:06:12.740> gonna<00:06:12.920> look<00:06:13.010> like<00:06:13.160> but<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:14.120> know

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
seems gonna look like but you know

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.000 
seems gonna look like but you know
assuming<00:06:14.570> they<00:06:14.780> lose<00:06:14.960> two<00:06:15.200> to<00:06:15.320> three<00:06:15.500> guys<00:06:15.680> but

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
assuming they lose two to three guys but

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.290 
assuming they lose two to three guys but
what<00:06:16.190> they<00:06:16.310> have<00:06:16.430> what<00:06:16.520> they<00:06:16.580> have<00:06:16.670> coming<00:06:17.060> in

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
what they have what they have coming in

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.390 
what they have what they have coming in
they<00:06:18.140> should<00:06:18.380> be<00:06:18.470> pretty<00:06:18.620> talented<00:06:18.920> just

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
they should be pretty talented just

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.860 
they should be pretty talented just
again<00:06:19.700> they'll<00:06:19.880> have<00:06:20.000> Brandon<00:06:20.360> Ashley<00:06:20.480> back

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
again they'll have Brandon Ashley back

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.500 
again they'll have Brandon Ashley back
you<00:06:21.170> know<00:06:21.290> assuming<00:06:21.590> he<00:06:21.890> gets<00:06:22.070> healthy<00:06:22.280> and

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
you know assuming he gets healthy and

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.640 
you know assuming he gets healthy and
that'll<00:06:23.510> be<00:06:23.600> a<00:06:23.630> big<00:06:23.780> thing<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:24.110> think<00:06:24.380> Kaleb

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
that'll be a big thing I think Kaleb

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.140 
that'll be a big thing I think Kaleb
Tarczewski<00:06:24.830> probably<00:06:25.580> sounds<00:06:25.910> like<00:06:26.000> he's

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
Tarczewski probably sounds like he's

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.640 
Tarczewski probably sounds like he's
leaning<00:06:26.390> towards<00:06:26.720> coming<00:06:26.990> back<00:06:27.140> that<00:06:27.380> bodes

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
leaning towards coming back that bodes

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.620 
leaning towards coming back that bodes
well<00:06:27.770> too<00:06:28.130> I<00:06:28.370> think<00:06:28.850> the<00:06:29.090> biggest<00:06:29.270> piece

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
well too I think the biggest piece

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.630 
well too I think the biggest piece
though<00:06:29.900> they're<00:06:30.140> gonna<00:06:30.290> miss<00:06:30.560> really<00:06:31.400> might

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
though they're gonna miss really might

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.280 
though they're gonna miss really might
be<00:06:31.670> Nick<00:06:32.000> Johnson<00:06:32.420> in<00:06:32.570> that<00:06:32.720> that<00:06:32.960> sort<00:06:33.260> of

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
be Nick Johnson in that that sort of

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.200 
be Nick Johnson in that that sort of
chemistry<00:06:33.740> he<00:06:33.860> brings<00:06:34.130> and<00:06:34.400> he<00:06:34.430> was<00:06:34.700> he<00:06:35.060> was<00:06:35.180> a

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
chemistry he brings and he was he was a

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.970 
chemistry he brings and he was he was a
true<00:06:35.420> leader<00:06:35.600> for<00:06:35.870> this<00:06:35.930> team<00:06:35.990> and<00:06:36.440> if<00:06:36.620> he<00:06:36.800> does

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
true leader for this team and if he does

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.250 
true leader for this team and if he does
leave<00:06:37.250> assuming<00:06:37.640> he<00:06:37.700> leaves<00:06:37.990> you<00:06:38.990> know<00:06:39.080> that's

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
leave assuming he leaves you know that's

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.750 
leave assuming he leaves you know that's
gonna<00:06:39.380> be<00:06:39.500> really<00:06:39.680> hard<00:06:39.950> to<00:06:40.010> replace<00:06:40.310> TJ

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
gonna be really hard to replace TJ

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.390 
gonna be really hard to replace TJ
