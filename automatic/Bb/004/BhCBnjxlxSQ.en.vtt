00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.670 

now<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.100> really<00:01:54.520> need<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.150> be<00:01:55.390> able<00:01:55.480> to<00:01:55.680> to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.080 

we'll<00:02:49.930> let<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.230> drain<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:51.130> I'll<00:02:51.700> go<00:02:51.820> get<00:02:51.940> my

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
we'll let that drain out I'll go get my

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
we'll let that drain out I'll go get my
oil<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.630> my<00:02:52.720> filter<00:02:53.050> ready<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.190> here

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
oil and my filter ready I can see here

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.850 
oil and my filter ready I can see here
my<00:02:54.580> my<00:02:55.240> numbers<00:02:55.570> match<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.140> it's<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> same

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
my my numbers match up so it's the same
