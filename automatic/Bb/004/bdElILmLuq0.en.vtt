00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
work around the sides and basically

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.140 
work around the sides and basically
almost<00:02:10.739> disconnect<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.819> leave<00:02:11.909> all

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.990 

all<00:02:33.070> right<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.490> can<00:02:33.580> see<00:02:33.640> what<00:02:33.910> I've

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
all right so as you can see what I've

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.490 
all right so as you can see what I've
done<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.510> I've<00:02:34.660> actually<00:02:34.840> faded<00:02:35.380> in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
done here is I've actually faded in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.770 
done here is I've actually faded in
lightly<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.730> hairline<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:37.270> through<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
lightly the hairline in through here and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.930 
lightly the hairline in through here and
just<00:02:38.020> basically<00:02:38.350> buzzed<00:02:38.710> all<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.370> around

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
just basically buzzed all this around

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.620 
just basically buzzed all this around
through<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> sides<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:42.160> both<00:02:42.400> sides<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:43.540> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
through the sides on both sides just to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.850 
through the sides on both sides just to
create<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.900> nice<00:02:44.020> tighter<00:02:44.350> looking<00:02:44.680> through

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
create a nice tighter looking through

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.440 
create a nice tighter looking through
here<00:02:45.130> which<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.730> then<00:02:45.850> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> create<00:02:46.210> some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
here which is then going to create some

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.660 
here which is then going to create some
separation<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:48.040> going<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.190> allow<00:02:48.340> me<00:02:48.460> to

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
separation and it's going to allow me to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.690 
separation and it's going to allow me to
actually<00:02:49.210> go<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.510> now<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.220> blend<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.340> all<00:02:51.550> in

actually go in now and blend this all in
by<00:02:51.910> hand<00:02:52.210> with<00:02:52.600> sheers<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.230> then<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.770> make

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
by hand with sheers and then to make

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.530 
by hand with sheers and then to make
this<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.100> little<00:02:54.190> bit<00:02:54.340> longer<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.120> edgier<00:02:55.270> on

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540

it or not the haircut will be pretty

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.170 
it or not the haircut will be pretty
much<00:03:39.340> close<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.670> being<00:03:39.849> done

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
much close to being done

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
it's going to create a little bit of

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.600 
it's going to create a little bit of
texture<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.069> through<00:03:57.190> here<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.430> it's<00:03:57.549> not

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
texture and through here so it's not

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.780 
texture and through here so it's not
just<00:03:57.849> straight<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.440> straight<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.470> bunch<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.549> hair

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
just straight a straight a bunch of hair

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.640 
just straight a straight a bunch of hair
that's<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.239> hanging<00:04:01.540> down<00:04:01.569> it<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.959> way<00:04:02.140> so

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
that's just hanging down it this way so

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.550 
that's just hanging down it this way so
you<00:04:02.680> can<00:04:03.420> slot<00:04:04.420> do<00:04:04.569> some<00:04:04.750> slide<00:04:05.019> cutting<00:04:05.410> like

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
you can slot do some slide cutting like

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.199 
you can slot do some slide cutting like
this<00:04:05.769> this<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.849> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> allow<00:04:07.420> for<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.989> nice

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
this this is going to allow for a nice

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.199 
this this is going to allow for a nice
some<00:04:10.209> separation<00:04:10.870> into<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.410> front<00:04:12.030> which<00:04:13.030> I

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
some separation into the front which I

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.119 
some separation into the front which I
like<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.599> like<00:04:13.750> doing<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.079> when<00:04:14.739> it's<00:04:14.860> dry

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
like it I like doing this when it's dry

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.129 
like it I like doing this when it's dry
as<00:04:15.370> well<00:04:15.579> I<00:04:15.879> like<00:04:16.299> cutting<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.630> hair<00:04:16.780> short<00:04:17.049> to

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
as well I like cutting the hair short to

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.740 
as well I like cutting the hair short to
dry<00:04:17.350> also<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.100> recommend<00:04:18.370> having<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:19.030> brush<00:04:19.539> like

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
dry also I recommend having a brush like

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.390 
dry also I recommend having a brush like
this<00:04:19.959> because<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:20.829> don't<00:04:20.919> want<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.220> hair<00:04:21.370> to

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
this because you don't want the hair to

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.950 
this because you don't want the hair to
fall<00:04:21.669> into<00:04:21.789> her<00:04:21.910> eyes<00:04:22.090> or<00:04:22.360> on<00:04:22.449> their<00:04:22.539> face<00:04:22.720> I'm

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
fall into her eyes or on their face I'm

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.930 
fall into her eyes or on their face I'm
very<00:04:23.169> very<00:04:24.010> very<00:04:24.400> particular<00:04:24.850> about<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:26.940> so

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
very very very particular about that so

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.469 
very very very particular about that so
