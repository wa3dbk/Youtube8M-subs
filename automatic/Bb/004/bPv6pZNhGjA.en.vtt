today i'd like to show you a little bit

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.369 
today i'd like to show you a little bit
how<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.190> can<00:00:05.490> use<00:00:05.790> cloud<00:00:06.180> cymeks<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.839> create<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
how you can use cloud cymeks to create a

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.740 
how you can use cloud cymeks to create a
roadway<00:00:08.130> profile<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.510> be<00:00:09.599> useful

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
roadway profile and this can be useful

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.080 
roadway profile and this can be useful
in<00:00:10.050> accident<00:00:10.500> reconstruction<00:00:11.099> whenever<00:00:11.790> you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
in accident reconstruction whenever you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.930 
in accident reconstruction whenever you
are<00:00:12.469> faced<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.740> design<00:00:14.370> issue<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.849> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
are faced with a design issue on the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.640

roadway or where there's been a serious

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.109 
roadway or where there's been a serious
accident<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.520> need<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.820> rebuild

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
accident and you just need to rebuild

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and I'm going to show you how we can do

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.849 
and I'm going to show you how we can do
some<00:00:26.400> stuff<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.960> bringing<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.590> point

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

a<00:00:37.170> file<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> small<00:00:39.059> section

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
a file that I have it's a small section

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.190 
a file that I have it's a small section
of<00:00:39.570> roadway<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.399> already<00:00:42.200> converted

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
of roadway that I had already converted

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.549 
of roadway that I had already converted
to<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:44.070> 2m<00:00:44.340> format<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> load<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.780> txt

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to see 2m format so when you load up txt

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.819 
to see 2m format so when you load up txt
files<00:00:46.590> XYZ<00:00:47.430> pts<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> resave<00:00:49.469> those<00:00:49.680> out

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
files XYZ pts you can resave those out

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.830 
files XYZ pts you can resave those out
as<00:00:50.039> c2m<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.760> an<00:00:50.850> optimized<00:00:51.300> format<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
as c2m and it's an optimized format so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.130 
as c2m and it's an optimized format so
it'll<00:00:52.170> work<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.579> better<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it'll work a little bit better so here I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
it'll work a little bit better so here I
have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.320> section<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.949> roadway<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
have a section of roadway and just to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
have a section of roadway and just to
show<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.050> manipulate<00:00:58.649> this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
show you that you can manipulate this

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.310 
show you that you can manipulate this
like<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> regular<00:00:59.879> max<00:01:00.239> object<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.079> do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
like a regular max object you can do

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.349 
like a regular max object you can do
things<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> adjust<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> pivot<00:01:02.579> point<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
things like adjust the pivot point so I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
things like adjust the pivot point so I
can<00:01:03.600> Center<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> object<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.890> just

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
can Center to the object you see just

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
can Center to the object you see just
the<00:01:05.519> gizmo<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.320> came<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the gizmo just came up here to the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
the gizmo just came up here to the
center<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.200> translate<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
center and I can also translate this and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.880 
center and I can also translate this and
rotate<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> scale<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:12.510> by<00:01:12.810> default<00:01:12.869> scale<00:01:13.710> is

also going to go into local mode and I'm

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.740 
also going to go into local mode and I'm
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> scale<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.659> oops<00:01:56.479> scale<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.689> down

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
going to scale this oops scale this down

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.289 
going to scale this oops scale this down
this<00:01:58.560> way<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.939> very

this way so you can see I have a very

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.120 
this way so you can see I have a very
small<00:02:00.509> section<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.200> roadway<00:02:01.759> right<00:02:03.259> ok<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.009> now

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
small section of roadway right ok so now

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.520 
small section of roadway right ok so now
from<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.780> what<00:02:06.780> i<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.170> turn<00:02:07.409> the

from here what i can do is turn the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.160 
from here what i can do is turn the
snaps<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.099> i'm<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.360> click<00:02:09.390> you'll

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
snaps on i'm going to right click you'll

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
snaps on i'm going to right click you'll
see<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> grid<00:02:10.649> points<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.190> i'm<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
see that grid points is on i'm going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.250 
see that grid points is on i'm going to
turn<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.420> off<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:12.840> want<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> snap<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
turn that off I don't want to snap to

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.730 
turn that off I don't want to snap to
any<00:02:13.440> good

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
any good

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.230 
any good
points<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> point

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
points I just want to have the point

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.210 
points I just want to have the point
cloud<00:02:15.390> cloud<00:02:15.660> some<00:02:15.930> X<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.920> way<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.190> not

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
cloud cloud some X on this way I'm not

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.310 
cloud cloud some X on this way I'm not
snapping<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.850> anything<00:02:18.000> else<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:19.230> also

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
snapping to anything else and I'm also

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.580 
snapping to anything else and I'm also
going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.800> into<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.280> shapes<00:02:20.610> line<00:02:21.590> snaps

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
going to go into the shapes line snaps

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.620 
going to go into the shapes line snaps
is<00:02:22.800> selected<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.880> should<00:02:24.180> be<00:02:24.300> able<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
is selected so now I should be able to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.700 
is selected so now I should be able to
start<00:02:25.580> drawing<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> line<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.530> so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
start drawing the line and like this so

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.290 
start drawing the line and like this so
I'm<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.130> start<00:02:29.280> from<00:02:29.430> here<00:02:29.760> start

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
I'm just going to start from here start

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.930 
I'm just going to start from here start
clicking<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.750> things<00:02:31.070> now<00:02:32.070> there<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.370> grass<00:02:32.670> in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
clicking on things now there is grass in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.530 
clicking on things now there is grass in
here<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> could<00:02:33.660> be<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.590> little<00:02:35.520> bit<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
here so it could be a little bit of a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.200 
here so it could be a little bit of a
problem<00:02:37.160> but<00:02:38.160> what<00:02:38.460> I'm<00:02:38.550> going<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.000> sort

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
problem but what I'm going to do is sort

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.110 
problem but what I'm going to do is sort
of<00:02:39.860> select<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> points<00:02:41.840> more<00:02:42.840> or<00:02:42.990> less<00:02:43.080> in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
of select the points more or less in

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.730 
of select the points more or less in
similar<00:02:45.120> locations<00:02:45.780> between<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> spines

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
similar locations between all the spines

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.560 
similar locations between all the spines
I'm<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.550> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.820> one<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.360> it's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I'm just going to do one now but it's

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.550 
I'm just going to do one now but it's
usually<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.960> good<00:02:49.050> idea<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.410> do<00:02:49.530> that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
usually a good idea to do that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.920 
usually a good idea to do that
especially<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:50.190> you're<00:02:50.420> creating<00:02:51.420> geometry

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
especially if you're creating geometry

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
especially if you're creating geometry
and<00:02:52.640> let's<00:02:53.640> say<00:02:53.820> may<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.110> right<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.290> ok<00:02:56.190> so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
and let's say may be right there ok so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.100 
and let's say may be right there ok so
I'm<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.970> want<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.240> modify<00:02:57.540> tab<00:02:57.870> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
I'm going to want to the modify tab and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.590 
I'm going to want to the modify tab and
I'm<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.350> make<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.560> thing<00:02:58.950> yellow<00:02:59.600> and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I'm going to make this thing yellow and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.580 
I'm going to make this thing yellow and
I'm<00:03:00.990> also<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.990> also<00:03:03.990> want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.350> make<00:03:04.440> it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
I'm also going to also want to make it

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.290 
I'm also going to also want to make it
renderable<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.280> give<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.550> size<00:03:05.790> here<00:03:06.150> so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
renderable and give it a size here so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.190 
renderable and give it a size here so
I'll<00:03:06.420> 8.1<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.160> see<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I'll 8.1 so you can really see it and

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.610 
I'll 8.1 so you can really see it and
only<00:03:10.710> rotate<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> bit<00:03:11.520> there<00:03:11.940> we<00:03:12.090> go<00:03:12.210> ok<00:03:13.080> so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
only rotate is a bit there we go ok so

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.110 
only rotate is a bit there we go ok so
you<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:13.740> see<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> spline<00:03:14.400> follows<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
you can see the spline follows the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
you can see the spline follows the
roadway<00:03:15.690> quite<00:03:15.930> well<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.290> that's<00:03:17.010> how<00:03:17.190> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
roadway quite well and that's how you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.030 
roadway quite well and that's how you
would<00:03:17.490> do<00:03:18.050> really<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.170> process<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.740> just<00:03:19.950> do

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
would do really the process you just do

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.620 
would do really the process you just do
it<00:03:20.130> over<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.460> over<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.730> over<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.330> I'll<00:03:21.480> do

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
it over and over and over but I'll do

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
it over and over and over but I'll do
one<00:03:21.780> more<00:03:21.990> just<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.380> show<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:22.890> I'm<00:03:23.310> going

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
one more just to show you what I'm going

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.250 
one more just to show you what I'm going
to<00:03:23.460> do<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.640> select<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.000> limit<00:03:24.240> box<00:03:24.450> again<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
to do is select the limit box again and

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.690 
to do is select the limit box again and
I'm<00:03:25.380> going<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.560> translate<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.310> down<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I'm going to translate this down the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.300 
I'm going to translate this down the
road<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.750> I'm<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.290> going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> let<00:03:29.100> me<00:03:29.160> take

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
road so I'm just going to let me take

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.980 
road so I'm just going to let me take
shut<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.610> snaps<00:03:29.910> off<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.360> don't<00:03:30.540> do

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
shut the snaps off so I don't do

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.840 
shut the snaps off so I don't do
anything<00:03:31.170> funny<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.460> see<00:03:32.640> as<00:03:32.730> I

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
anything funny here and you see as I

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.940 
anything funny here and you see as I
move<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.360> moves<00:03:33.690> down<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.020> road<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.620> i'll

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
move it it moves down the road and i'll

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.700 
move it it moves down the road and i'll
just<00:03:35.070> i'll<00:03:35.250> pick<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.520> point<00:03:35.760> about<00:03:35.970> here<00:03:36.710> yeah

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
just i'll pick a point about here yeah

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.220 
just i'll pick a point about here yeah
that<00:03:37.860> should<00:03:38.010> work<00:03:38.480> something<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.960> and

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that should work something like that and

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.200 
that should work something like that and
i<00:03:40.800> just<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.130> same<00:03:41.160> thing<00:03:41.520> over<00:03:41.670> again<00:03:41.820> so

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
i just do the same thing over again so

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.290 
i just do the same thing over again so
i'm<00:03:42.570> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> go<00:03:42.780> back<00:03:42.960> to<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.170> line<00:03:43.620> tool

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
i'm going to go back to the line tool

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.790 
i'm going to go back to the line tool
snap<00:03:45.300> select<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.050> i'm<00:03:46.230> going<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> start<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
snap select it and i'm going to start to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.420 
snap select it and i'm going to start to
select<00:03:47.160> points<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.800> like<00:03:50.400> that

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
select points here like that like that

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.490 
select points here like that like that
like<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:56.340> in<00:03:56.700> case<00:03:56.850> you're<00:03:57.030> wondering

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
like that and in case you're wondering

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.450 
like that and in case you're wondering
to<00:03:58.500> move<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.830> screen<00:03:59.130> i'm<00:03:59.280> actually

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
to move the screen i'm actually

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.760 
to move the screen i'm actually
selecting<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.360> using<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.750> i<00:04:00.780> key<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.740> that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
selecting are using the i key and that

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.810 
selecting are using the i key and that
actually<00:04:02.100> centers<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.870> position<00:04:04.260> of<00:04:04.350> the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
actually centers the position of the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.560 
actually centers the position of the
cursor<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.410> if<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.500> try<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.680> use<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:08.570> pan

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
cursor and if you try to use the pan

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.360 
cursor and if you try to use the pan
tools<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.230> such<00:04:10.410> I'd<00:04:10.740> actually<00:04:10.950> want<00:04:11.220> work

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
tools and such I'd actually want work

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.240 
tools and such I'd actually want work
it'll<00:04:11.580> actually<00:04:11.870> stop<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.900> tool<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:14.160> I'm

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
it'll actually stop the tool and I'm

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.350 
it'll actually stop the tool and I'm
just<00:04:14.340> going<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.520> go<00:04:14.580> like<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.880> that's<00:04:15.150> fine

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
just going to go like that that's fine

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.690 
just going to go like that that's fine
ok<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.890> I'm<00:04:17.520> going<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.090> shut<00:04:18.270> snaps<00:04:18.600> off<00:04:18.780> again

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
ok so I'm going to shut snaps off again

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.620 
ok so I'm going to shut snaps off again
probably<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.820> i'll<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.150> i'll<00:04:21.359> bring<00:04:21.480> up

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
probably what i'll do is i'll bring up

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.990 
probably what i'll do is i'll bring up
the<00:04:21.810> layers<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:22.470> i<00:04:23.280> will<00:04:23.400> shut<00:04:23.580> off<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.790> limit

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
the layers and i will shut off the limit

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.820 
the layers and i will shut off the limit
box<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.450> see<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> whole<00:04:24.979> point<00:04:25.979> cloud

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
box so you can see the whole point cloud

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.580 
box so you can see the whole point cloud
and<00:04:26.949> this<00:04:27.159> other<00:04:27.960> let's<00:04:28.960> see<00:04:29.110> about<00:04:29.199> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
and this other let's see about the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.110 
and this other let's see about the
modified<00:04:29.979> tab<00:04:30.159> I'll<00:04:30.310> turn<00:04:30.430> make<00:04:30.639> this<00:04:30.759> yellow

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
modified tab I'll turn make this yellow

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.119 
modified tab I'll turn make this yellow
as<00:04:31.270> well<00:04:31.449> just<00:04:32.259> so<00:04:32.349> we<00:04:32.439> can<00:04:32.530> see<00:04:32.740> both<00:04:32.919> of<00:04:32.979> them

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:33.129 
as well just so we can see both of them

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.570 
as well just so we can see both of them
easier<00:04:33.759> okay<00:04:34.150> that's<00:04:34.810> better<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:36.039> I've<00:04:36.370> got

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
easier okay that's better so I've got

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.429 
easier okay that's better so I've got
them<00:04:36.729> both<00:04:36.849> here<00:04:37.120> you<00:04:37.300> can<00:04:37.419> see<00:04:37.599> them<00:04:37.750> they're

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
them both here you can see them they're

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.279 
them both here you can see them they're
lying<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.949> point<00:04:39.189> cloud<00:04:39.340> quite<00:04:40.030> well<00:04:40.289> so

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
lying on the point cloud quite well so

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.010 
lying on the point cloud quite well so
if<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.919> want<00:04:42.219> to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.610> mesh<00:04:43.000> terrain<00:04:43.659> or<00:04:43.960> a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
if you want to make a mesh terrain or a

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.350 
if you want to make a mesh terrain or a
mesh<00:04:44.879> roadway<00:04:45.879> what<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.479> can<00:04:46.659> do<00:04:46.840> now<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:48.360> go

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
mesh roadway what you can do now is go

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.469 
mesh roadway what you can do now is go
into<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.990> geometry<00:04:50.469> tab<00:04:50.650> again<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.479> actually

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
into the geometry tab again and actually

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.850 
into the geometry tab again and actually
I'm<00:04:52.930> going<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.169> show<00:04:53.289> off<00:04:53.319> the<00:04:53.500> point<00:04:53.650> cloud

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
I'm going to show off the point cloud

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.649 
I'm going to show off the point cloud
just<00:04:54.069> to<00:04:54.159> make<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.400> easier<00:04:54.759> it's<00:04:55.509> more

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
just to make this easier it's more

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.040 
just to make this easier it's more
visible<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.979> I've<00:04:57.219> got<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:58.120> two<00:04:58.750> splines

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
visible so I've got just the two splines

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.499 
visible so I've got just the two splines
here<00:04:59.259> i'm<00:04:59.409> going<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.590> select<00:04:59.740> them<00:04:59.949> both<00:05:00.069> and

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
here i'm going to select them both and

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.939 
here i'm going to select them both and
now<00:05:01.509> what<00:05:01.659> I'll<00:05:01.780> do<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.110> in<00:05:02.319> the<00:05:02.440> geometry<00:05:02.620> tab

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
now what I'll do is in the geometry tab

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.559 
now what I'll do is in the geometry tab
I'm<00:05:03.190> going<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.370> go<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.490> compound<00:05:04.030> objects<00:05:04.389> and

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
I'm going to go to compound objects and

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.379 
I'm going to go to compound objects and
terrain<00:05:04.960> just<00:05:05.289> hit<00:05:05.889> terrain<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.490> i'm<00:05:07.270> going

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
terrain just hit terrain and i'm going

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.969 
terrain just hit terrain and i'm going
to<00:05:07.479> show<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.409> mesh<00:05:08.650> on<00:05:08.889> the

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
to show you the mesh on the

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.649 
to show you the mesh on the
triangulation<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.759> I've<00:05:10.270> got<00:05:10.419> a<00:05:10.449> mesh

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
triangulation and I've got a mesh

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.770 
triangulation and I've got a mesh
between<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:12.310> two<00:05:12.490> lines<00:05:12.699> so<00:05:13.060> which<00:05:13.389> you

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
between the the two lines so which you

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.059 
between the the two lines so which you
know<00:05:13.870> should<00:05:14.110> match<00:05:14.259> up<00:05:14.289> quite<00:05:14.710> well<00:05:14.740> with<00:05:15.009> the

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
know should match up quite well with the

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.640 
know should match up quite well with the
roadway<00:05:15.370> so<00:05:15.960> let's<00:05:16.960> just<00:05:17.289> give<00:05:17.409> this<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.560> shot

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
roadway so let's just give this a shot

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.860 
roadway so let's just give this a shot
see<00:05:18.159> what<00:05:18.190> happens<00:05:18.669> if<00:05:18.759> we<00:05:18.819> turn<00:05:19.029> the<00:05:19.210> point

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
see what happens if we turn the point

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.140 
see what happens if we turn the point
cloud<00:05:20.020> back<00:05:20.259> on<00:05:20.469> and<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:21.789> can<00:05:21.909> see<00:05:22.029> I<00:05:22.060> have

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
cloud back on and you can see I have

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.719 
cloud back on and you can see I have
pretty<00:05:22.569> good<00:05:23.009> pretty<00:05:24.009> good<00:05:24.129> matching<00:05:24.610> here

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
pretty good pretty good matching here

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.820 
pretty good pretty good matching here
between<00:05:24.939> the<00:05:25.360> mesh<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.259> roadway<00:05:26.529> now

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
between the mesh and the roadway now

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.990 
between the mesh and the roadway now
here<00:05:27.009> there's<00:05:27.189> something<00:05:27.490> going<00:05:27.699> on<00:05:27.759> and<00:05:27.909> I

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
here there's something going on and I

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.550 
here there's something going on and I
may<00:05:28.150> if<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.419> may<00:05:28.479> have<00:05:28.689> selected<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.139> bad<00:05:29.319> point

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
may if I may have selected a bad point

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.320 
may if I may have selected a bad point
of<00:05:29.770> course<00:05:29.949> I'm<00:05:30.069> doing<00:05:30.219> this<00:05:30.310> kind<00:05:30.909> of<00:05:31.029> quickly

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
of course I'm doing this kind of quickly

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.499 
of course I'm doing this kind of quickly
here<00:05:31.479> but<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:32.529> think<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.039> get<00:05:33.129> the<00:05:33.190> point<00:05:33.509> it's

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
here but I think you get the point it's

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.800 
here but I think you get the point it's
rather<00:05:35.440> tedious<00:05:35.710> if<00:05:36.009> you're<00:05:36.129> doing<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.810> you

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
rather tedious if you're doing this you

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.240 
rather tedious if you're doing this you
know<00:05:37.900> for<00:05:38.259> a<00:05:38.289> very<00:05:38.529> very<00:05:38.620> long<00:05:38.830> stretch<00:05:39.219> of

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
know for a very very long stretch of

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.309 
know for a very very long stretch of
roadway<00:05:39.550> however<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.360> does<00:05:40.509> work<00:05:40.690> it's<00:05:40.900> simple

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
roadway however it does work it's simple

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.860 
roadway however it does work it's simple
and<00:05:41.699> once<00:05:42.699> you<00:05:42.819> create<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.240> final<00:05:43.569> terrain

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
and once you create the final terrain

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.050 
and once you create the final terrain
it's<00:05:44.080> very<00:05:44.589> fast<00:05:44.919> and<00:05:45.219> then<00:05:45.639> you<00:05:45.759> can<00:05:45.909> then

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
it's very fast and then you can then

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.600 
it's very fast and then you can then
export<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.599> out<00:05:46.719> into<00:05:47.020> another<00:05:47.889> piece<00:05:48.490> of

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
export it out into another piece of

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.749 
export it out into another piece of
software<00:05:48.940> so<00:05:49.810> that's<00:05:50.229> it<00:05:50.440> for<00:05:51.310> Heidi's<00:05:51.400> cloud

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
software so that's it for Heidi's cloud

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.119 
software so that's it for Heidi's cloud
smacks<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.690> create<00:05:52.990> roadway<00:05:53.379> profiles<00:05:53.830> and

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
smacks to create roadway profiles and

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.909 
smacks to create roadway profiles and
thank<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.639> very<00:05:54.789> much
