00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.350 
when you when you think about this this
is<00:04:27.750> based<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.530> 10<00:04:29.100> or<00:04:29.280> 11<00:04:29.610> minutes<00:04:29.880> short

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
is based on a 10 or 11 minutes short

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.650 
is based on a 10 or 11 minutes short
that<00:04:31.080> won<00:04:31.260> an<00:04:31.380> Academy<00:04:31.919> Award<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.910> when<00:04:33.600> you

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
that won an Academy Award so when you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.540 
that won an Academy Award so when you
think<00:04:33.840> about<00:04:33.870> that's<00:04:34.200> still<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.680> lot<00:04:34.889> of<00:04:34.950> extra

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
think about that's still a lot of extra

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.140 
think about that's still a lot of extra
footage<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:38.490> just<00:04:40.220> expand<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.460> story<00:04:41.880> and

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
footage to to just expand the story and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.070 
footage to to just expand the story and
the<00:04:42.210> themes<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.780> everything<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.270> still

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
the themes and everything but it still

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.010 
the themes and everything but it still
