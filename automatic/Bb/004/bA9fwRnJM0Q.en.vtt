00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hello everybody, now it's the turn 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.150
 iron grip that is i will show you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 My own instrument that I made 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 in a hurry 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.060
 to fix the grip so you can 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.130
 had to buy this nut someone would be taken away 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.720
 sorry not clutch i'm not a lot 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.759
 such skeptical because 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 centrifugal oil filter they don't 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.659
 Well, here for example 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.599
 disassembled iron clutch and how 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.960
 see here any capacity for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.510
 so that this here itself has developed to no 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.310
 In general, there is some such 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.070
 little fucking whole thing 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.870
 but when he gets clogged up 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 this mud gets stuck 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.400
 Well, here's a bright proof of how 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 see all 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.300
 let's say so crammed here this half here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.370
 some sort of shavings do not know what it is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.860
 even so general I then grip this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.350
 trash and keep and throws in the engine 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.450
 and the engine in a circle is all this shit 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.519
 begin to knead again agree curtains 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.360
 for the engine, well, well, not good 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.760
 so if you have the opportunity or 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 your grip is completely dead 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.350
 so it makes sense to change it to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.390
 aluminum glazing since u 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.790
 aluminum boil after all there are 100 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.370
 poor oil filter or rather let's say 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.280
 capaciously for this shit i principle if 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:29.670
 look behind the back side since 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.070
 it would be so visible here 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.180
 here the places do not see what we had 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.450
 in iron grip that is all the dirt and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.400
 she keeps right here and in the engine but not 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.080
 throws out so with like that a 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.500
 clutch your engine will be 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.049
 feel a little better 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.659
 Well now back to this iron 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.720
 coupling in general here once i 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.119
 used a puller for oil 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 filter he was in my chain nakida 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.840
 The hair circle was a pen and held but 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.710
 I once had this story 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 that man brought me an engine and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.240
 in the evening he had to pick it up I'm 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.319
 the turn was here to replace 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.879
 friction lining clutch 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.590
 when i started to unscrew the nut 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.109
 it turned out that the nut but very much 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.719
 tightened and in general I have a chain chair 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.790
 digging again for a pack I did not 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.400
 Overall I got it already slippers and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.709
 I decided to do such a freak yes 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.019
 Yes 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.620
 it looks terrible just terrible I know but 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.159
 yet like that he attacks from 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.169
 affairs rather clutch he keeps tightly 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.200
 This was done by adapting them to say 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.999
 a big hurry in general I had left 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.659
 just a few hours and I need something 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:49.419
 it was quick to come up found 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.669
 yourself in the garage some kind of bar here 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.889
 here's how you see here made the cuts 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.680
 so that I could, without heating my arms, bend 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.250
 did here such a collective farm curve 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.519
 ring 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.409
 Well, in general, fought nuts here 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.819
 By the way Gadget on 22 millimeters just 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.199
 at times gives here in this groove and in general here 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.480
 so here is this thing us pounce 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:13.329
 a little tight but nothing is 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.729
 well will not slip out not like someone 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.709
 probably say that here it was possible 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:19.479
 Much neater do yes agree 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.759
 could be much more careful to do 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:24.609
 find just some suitable 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.849
 pipe with a suitable diameter 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.949
 talking nuts all that great 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.810
 clean well 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.479
 attributed to a normal welder as they are 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.829
 I keep snot myself but here 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.829
 it's not beauty 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.639
 the main thing that this thing worked well, that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.530
 guys like that 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.199
 I once had to surf 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.879
 enjoy enjoyed this piece 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:47.739
 metal for about two years but 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.169
 i want to tell you me sometimes so 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.090
 decently rescued not audible mouth it was 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.189
 clutch retainer hope this video 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.150
 I will be useful to someone until all 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.150
 bye everyone
