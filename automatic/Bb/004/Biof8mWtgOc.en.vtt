00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
for that injury try to work around it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.170 
for that injury try to work around it
try<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> work<00:02:16.650> through<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.250> try<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.940> build

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
try to work through it and try to build

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.530 
try to work through it and try to build
strength<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:20.180> bench-pressing<00:02:21.180> without

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
strength on it so bench-pressing without

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.360 
strength on it so bench-pressing without
wrist<00:02:21.810> fraps<00:02:22.050> maybe<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.710> your<00:02:22.830> speed<00:02:23.130> day

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
wrist fraps maybe just on your speed day

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.180 
wrist fraps maybe just on your speed day
would<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> good<00:02:24.840> good<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.650> helping<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
would be a good good way of helping to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.890 
would be a good good way of helping to
build<00:02:26.460> some<00:02:26.610> strength<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
build some strength there and if it

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
build some strength there and if it
feels<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.440> hurts<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.920> lighten<00:02:29.520> that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
feels like it hurts and lighten that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
feels like it hurts and lighten that
weight<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.060> little<00:02:30.240> bit<00:02:30.420> until<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.200> pain

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
weight up a little bit until the pain

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.810 
weight up a little bit until the pain
subsides<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.190> hopefully<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.670> get

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
subsides and hopefully you can get

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.770 
subsides and hopefully you can get
stronger<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.330> stronger

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
stronger and stronger

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.170 
stronger and stronger
over<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> period<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.800> time<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.459> that's<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.940> from

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
over a period of time and that's it from

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.740 
over a period of time and that's it from
super<00:02:36.480> training<00:02:36.690> TV<00:02:37.350> later
