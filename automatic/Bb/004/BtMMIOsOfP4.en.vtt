00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.820
 Hello everyone, well, what about that? 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.540
 to straighten semiautomatic or not 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:17.240
 so this is the wing on this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.470
 the car is aligned with a semi-automatic 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.650
 prehistory 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.410
 need to know from the previous video 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.580
 the car was repaired by my student 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.580
 but but decided 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:41.100
 apparently help me with straightening and that we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 see means here here on the wing was 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 a warehouse is feasible and here it was 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.070
 blown completely here was a failure was 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 here more no less did mean that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.629
 here here here if well 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.470
 look at this you can see 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:08.820
 welding a semi-automatic 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.409
 already sharpened and everywhere throughout for all 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 folds here here that is what 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.979
 going police arrest with potter 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 cooler a nifiga like metal 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.070
 overstretched 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 that's here now is the attachment 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.380
 some kind of piece of iron 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.049
 hammer on the so-called sweat 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.049
 welding it with a semi-automatic 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.110
 retention from these boobs zones 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.020
 overstrain so-called sweat it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 all for grinding and in the end what 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.140
 It turns out in the end there is no iron to sell 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.869
 his psyche canvases under from the semi-automatic 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 no iron here 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.289
 grabbed a cooler pulled 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.009
 1 here grabbed grabbed out 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:05.490
 so also the next drop is not waste ie 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.050
 actually it turns out there is no metal here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.390
 and where he stayed is not up turned very 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:17.730
 strong metal stress 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.660
 that there is something here that is not necessary 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.660
 all yes tinker what what to do in it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.420
 the case should be seated thermal to 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.540
 somehow weaken this is now 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.310
 incomprehensible 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.079
 on stupidity on can say that this 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.269
 right that metal is so tense 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.640
 yes a fig like metal should be 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.610
 keep fit they are tense 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.150
 able to be why because 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.099
 we start here for spat yes everything 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.989
 align color let's start your 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.180
 thermal thermal drops 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:55.890
 temperatures and everything that we put here with 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.150
 walking metal will crack 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.459
 and in the end 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 there will be a full grid with all 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:10.319
 Rusty bugs to the wrong 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.989
 like that is, I basically do not want 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.380
 no one that imposes tells you something 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.940
 what i went through 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:24.450
 what I know at the moment is up to you 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.610
 align this way or not right 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.810
 yours that is 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.970
 It's probably easier from here with 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.570
 any hole behind the stage flush 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.370
 squeeze than so here to trash 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.410
 metal and the student will have to do 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.690
 admonition that this is no longer 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.300
 repeated 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.880
 grabs guys think good luck to all 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.970
 I'll set it all up again 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.830
 upset the metal so he barely ass 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.300
 weakened this tension here 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.610
 it is seen 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.900
 then re-align the colors later 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.610
 8 will have to solder all these holes 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:13.480
 such ones i did not i did 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.709
 just stoch and just opened so 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.390
 think it is worth with a potter rift and two 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.160
 semi-automatic so-called reverse 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.210
 a hammer collective farm all this peel I 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.340
 I understand somewhere there is small 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.450
 in hard to reach places can still be when 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.000
 no when there is an approach to some 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.020
 of course wants to squeeze out of there you think 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.020
 decide for yourself
