00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.449
 about what I have on my nails today 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 because my nails are really all 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.910

 then a layer of these here is me 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.920

 me today on the nails it is by the way 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.140
 these are the two that Masha sent me 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.360
 Our main thanks to Masha Big 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 cash for the test I have some not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 some have already tried most 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 that impression will be soon 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.470
 such a global video about all their 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.649
 Received from Masha pro Laki, too, so 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.710
 these two varnishes and this one 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.450
 beautiful here it is generally perfect 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 as I say finely chopped garbage 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 here are these sparkles 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 here are some hexagons and these 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.670
 here are the stripes and some small dots 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 Autumn of which there is nothing but such as 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.979
 just in one cover it falls 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.789
 ingeniously and smoothly 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.489
 base is not goose 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.640
 then I don't have to catch anything and here 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 really look here is one cover 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.170
 here she and she smooth but nothing 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.849
 she clings smooth she 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.620
 there’s nothing above this 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.840
 little brought me details unfortunately us 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.609
 this brand is not available then I typed more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.370
 now here 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:35.609
 chopped up rubbish just differently 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.269
 enjoying alone let's start over 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.010
 I had this one here in two layers flag 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.569
 I will tell about it in detail in a separate 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.939
 video when I will do a review on everything 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.780
 lucky that Masha sent me but he 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:50.879
 such he is on a blueberry monument something and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.049
 there is a little so I don’t know 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:58.590
 they gave you will not see yaga water 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:03.900
 lilac such a shimmer on the nails 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.989
 he is seen well, so you have to strain yourself 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.950
 I denounced this varnish for several days 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.220
 some few good days 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.919
 probably 5 ok everything was small 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.079
 he has a problem here I don't even think 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:19.829
 what with lacquer i think him a tassel know 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.659
 very thin varnish slightly pays not me 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.120
 I think that all the same it is because of the brush well 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.449
 and liquid varnish and brush still small in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.760
 general double complexity but in general he 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:33.229
 I kept very decent and I decided it 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.769
 decorate the whole thing afterwards like this 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:41.729
 trash bin finely chopped from keiko 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:49.609
 this is our number where the main is written here 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:53.760
 probably 37 this is miso we have here 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.190
 288 in general here is this lagna me 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.360
 absolutely not typical I'll be like that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.430
 lilac blueberry so color so 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.650
 curious going forward like this he 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.650
 looked on his own 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.730
 The track was this is now also on the cover 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.200
 a couple of days and from above here I don't know 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.920
 I see you try to show on here 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.260
 so here so here so coverage 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.690
 top and it all turned out to me 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.240
 it just seems ingeniously interesting how I 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.630
 I will soak it but thank God the method 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.930
 foil there will be data stock up 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.780
 patience and we will soak your nails 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.740
 It looks like this super duper puff 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.050
 manicure 20 layers I like to change 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.270
 alarmists in the process of their wear they just 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.550
 there a week defied sisters I varnishes 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.460
 almost everything keeps as nailed 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.170
 which I manage to inflict are rare 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.230
 copies of which I do not mind the morning 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.480
 apply but those that I apply without 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 bases without most often and nails not 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.240
 paint and hold just as nailed 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.160
 literally well that's how you see yes 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.910
 having gone through so much transformation 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.360
 but probably now manicure days 7 already 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.340
 That's how it looks for a couple of days 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.110
 take it off soak and come up 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:29.060
 something new literally on the go 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:33.390
 such beauty turned out not for those 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.210
 three wonderful varnishes like this 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.810
 all looked separately and like this 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.980
 they look together 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.980
 thank you very much for watching
