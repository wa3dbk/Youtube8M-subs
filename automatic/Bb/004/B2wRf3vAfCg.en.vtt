 not long ago the comic is a 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 nerd subculture that was on the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 of art and entertainment and suddenly 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 the comics to stand on a base 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 Structural both comic 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 have yielded some of the biggest box office 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.260
 of the story sums up came out of the pages 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 comics to devour the brain 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 new week cable tv are among the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.140
 best selling comic books 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 have tripled their sales after 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.220
 that tablets became fashionable and the trick 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 of the major Hollywood studios was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.630
 acquire the leading publishers of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 comics that have an infinite number of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 character to do what they 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.770
 want series movies doll t-shirt 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 only that they have and reinvent the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.149
 characters all the time I do not know if it is 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
 extend the range and this can sometimes be 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 good but most of the time it's not 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 when they like it was announced as a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.210
 series about bruce wayne's childhood 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 I felt a little pretense of batman 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 not exactly a story for 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.699
 children and it would not work as 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.840
 smallville worked for the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.520
 gay teens 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.260
 in fact the story of the series turns in 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.600
 around james gordon that one day will 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.060
 to start but you already know that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.430
 how boot is loaded with criminals 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.680
 Mafiosi 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 terrorists from time to time I found 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 it was a good choice to put the future 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 Commissar as main character 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.100
 only because this is risky because it creates a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 generic dramatic police series 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.200
 set in the universe full of villains 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.110
 of comics and decided to transform 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 main arch of Batman mythology in 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.619
 a bruce wayne conspiracy 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.170
 originally a victim of violence 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.970
 of the streets is what makes it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 crazy in pajamas and running out 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.259
 by the streets calm bandit transform 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 the murders of the parents of Brazil and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.670
 in a wonderful plot is to destroy this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.280
 principle to throw away this methodology 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.439
 throw away the symbolism of the character 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 for me I would take walks so he 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 had not studied in Europe and that it would 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.649
 completely the character drop a 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.240
 series that has potential and has fans to 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.380
 take this series forward but I have 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 a bad news 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.520
 The second episode is far below what 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 It was the pilot episode and look at me. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.110
 pilot episode could have been better 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 What did you think of the gotham premiere? 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.350
 leave your opinion in the comments and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.930
 say if you keep watching 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.510
 series and do not forget to sign up 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.070
 in the nerdy grumpy as I know the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420
 Most Batman Fans Never Read 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.000
 no comic book this is a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.710
 fact if the fault of the knot a hint that the scene 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.320
 shot that killed the parents in the process n 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.460
 was directly inspired in batman year 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.930
 one by frank miller 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.640
 it's worth you to look up this story 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.640
 parallel comics is very fucking
