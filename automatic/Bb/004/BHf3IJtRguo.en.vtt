number one top tip for gaining lean

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.100 
number one top tip for gaining lean
muscle<00:00:22.170> however<00:00:23.630> what<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> do<00:00:25.020> is

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
muscle however what I'm going to do is

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.130 
muscle however what I'm going to do is
break<00:00:25.290> it<00:00:25.349> into<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.770> two<00:00:25.980> part<00:00:26.250> video<00:00:26.930> so<00:00:27.930> I've

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
break it into a two part video so I've

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310 
break it into a two part video so I've
kind<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.950> equal<00:00:29.460> top<00:00:29.849> ones<00:00:30.180> what<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.290> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
kind of got to equal top ones what is a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.430 
kind of got to equal top ones what is a
supplement<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.880> believe<00:00:33.390> every<00:00:34.230> girl

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
supplement that I believe every girl

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
supplement that I believe every girl
should<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.739> taking<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.120> lean

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
should be taking if you have to lean

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.170 
should be taking if you have to lean
mass<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.989> or<00:00:37.680> improve<00:00:38.430> body<00:00:38.670> composition

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
mass and or improve body composition

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
mass and or improve body composition
changes<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.530> think<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.579> much

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
changes and I think that pretty much

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.779 
changes and I think that pretty much
includes<00:00:42.300> 99.9<00:00:43.260> percent<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> population

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
includes 99.9 percent of the population

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.470 
includes 99.9 percent of the population
and<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:46.289> other<00:00:46.589> training<00:00:46.980> tip<00:00:47.339> so<00:00:47.609> part<00:00:48.179> two

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and the other training tip so part two

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.079 
and the other training tip so part two
of<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.839> video<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.859> my<00:00:50.160> number<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.760> top

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
of this video will be my number one top

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.739 
of this video will be my number one top
training<00:00:51.960> tip<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.070> an<00:00:53.219> acquire<00:00:53.969> lean

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
training tip to get an acquire lean

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.639 
training tip to get an acquire lean
muscle<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:57.539> safe<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.929> say<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
muscle and I think it's safe to say that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.959 
muscle and I think it's safe to say that
at<00:00:59.149> 69<00:01:00.149> odd<00:01:00.390> kilos<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> lean<00:01:01.230> mass<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:02.159> I<00:01:02.370> do

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
at 69 odd kilos of lean mass here I do

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.210 
at 69 odd kilos of lean mass here I do
know<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> thing<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.050> about<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.949> lean

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
know a thing or two about about lean

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
know a thing or two about about lean
muscle<00:01:05.670> gains<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.460> had<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> privilege<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
muscle gains so I had the privilege of

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
muscle gains so I had the privilege of
not<00:01:10.229> only<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.740> through<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.850> metabolic

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not only going through the metabolic

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.860 
not only going through the metabolic
precision<00:01:12.900> course<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.560> also<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.280> been

researchers in creatine now before you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.750 
researchers in creatine now before you
turn<00:01:27.300> off<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.920> I've<00:01:29.190> tried

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
turn off and think I know I've tried

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.900 
turn off and think I know I've tried
creatine<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.390> ba-ba-ba-ba-ba<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:32.310> hold<00:01:32.730> on

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
creatine or ba-ba-ba-ba-ba just hold on

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.740 
creatine or ba-ba-ba-ba-ba just hold on
and<00:01:33.270> listen<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.490> number<00:01:35.940> one<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
number one supplement that I believe you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
number one supplement that I believe you
should<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.090> taking<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.870> creatine<00:01:40.470> monohydrate

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
should be taking is creatine monohydrate

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.080 
should be taking is creatine monohydrate
and<00:01:42.500> don't<00:01:43.500> let<00:01:43.770> any<00:01:43.920> salesperson<00:01:44.730> talk<00:01:44.910> you

into any other kind of creatine
it's<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.550> monohydrate<00:01:48.150> that<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.320> must<00:01:49.560> have

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it's the monohydrate that you must have

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's the monohydrate that you must have
now<00:01:50.720> as<00:01:51.890> opposed<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.310> following<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.060> label<00:01:54.540> or

following what the sales rep tells you
to<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.820> what<00:02:00.210> dr.<00:02:00.600> Paul<00:02:00.780> KREEP<00:02:01.080> came<00:02:01.380> up

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to do what what dr. Paul KREEP came up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.020 
to do what what dr. Paul KREEP came up
with<00:02:01.830> was<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:03.050> creatine<00:02:04.050> cycling<00:02:05.040> method<00:02:05.460> which

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
with was a creatine cycling method which

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.300 
with was a creatine cycling method which
he<00:02:06.330> found<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.870> be<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.470> most<00:02:07.680> effective

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
he found to be the most effective

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.930 
he found to be the most effective
because<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.330> whole<00:02:09.539> idea<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> creatine<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:11.099> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
because the whole idea of creatine is to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.059 
because the whole idea of creatine is to
keep<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.569> concentration<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.500> creates

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
keep the concentration of creates

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.530 
keep the concentration of creates
very<00:02:14.670> high<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.269> your<00:02:15.840> muscles<00:02:16.260> at<00:02:16.439> all<00:02:16.920> times

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
very high in your muscles at all times

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.170 
very high in your muscles at all times
so<00:02:18.829> look<00:02:19.829> with<00:02:20.129> this<00:02:20.280> creatine<00:02:20.819> monohydrate

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
so look with this creatine monohydrate

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.420 
so look with this creatine monohydrate
what<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.140> expect<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.860> three-month

more contractile proteins in the muscle
we're<00:02:54.150> looking<00:02:54.569> at<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.739> two<00:02:55.769> kilo<00:02:56.569> loss<00:02:57.569> of

but<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.329> big<00:03:18.540> question<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.199> have<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:20.010> take<00:03:20.280> it

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
but the big question is have to take it

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.110 
but the big question is have to take it
well<00:03:21.359> interestingly<00:03:22.430> it's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.609> credit<00:03:23.940> in

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
well interestingly it's a credit in

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.319 
well interestingly it's a credit in

days on three days off girls it doesn't

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.720 
days on three days off girls it doesn't
matter<00:03:31.169> whether<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.769> are<00:03:31.919> training<00:03:32.280> or<00:03:32.549> not

off and this keeps going into missional
it<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.519> keeps<00:03:41.819> going<00:03:42.199> okay<00:03:43.199> now<00:03:44.389> what<00:03:45.389> we<00:03:45.540> do

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
it just keeps going okay now what we do

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.229 
it just keeps going okay now what we do
recommend<00:03:46.139> is<00:03:46.730> for<00:03:47.730> say<00:03:48.629> you're<00:03:49.290> an<00:03:49.410> average

three days on falls on a training day I

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.629 
three days on falls on a training day I
highly<00:04:10.199> recommend<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:11.040> have<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.430> in

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
highly recommend that you have it in

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.610 
highly recommend that you have it in
your<00:04:11.819> pre<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.239> post<00:04:12.449> shakes<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.109> that's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
your pre and post shakes and that's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.219 
your pre and post shakes and that's
because<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.280> creating<00:04:14.760> uptake<00:04:15.389> is<00:04:15.780> better

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
because the creating uptake is better

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.849 
because the creating uptake is better
when<00:04:16.949> you<00:04:17.070> drink<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:18.180> protein<00:04:18.840> liquid

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
when you drink a protein liquid

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.369 
when you drink a protein liquid
and<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.189> carbohydrate<00:04:20.669> liquid<00:04:21.509> so<00:04:21.959> that's<00:04:22.229> a

00:04:22.369 --> 00:04:22.379 
and a carbohydrate liquid so that's a

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.070 
and a carbohydrate liquid so that's a
very<00:04:22.560> optimum<00:04:23.129> time<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.610> take<00:04:23.849> it<00:04:24.060> other<00:04:24.780> than

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
very optimum time to take it other than

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.990 
very optimum time to take it other than
that<00:04:25.169> take<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:25.949> with<00:04:26.310> your<00:04:26.550> meals<00:04:26.759> and

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
that take it with your meals and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.659 
that take it with your meals and
preferably<00:04:27.509> with<00:04:27.810> water<00:04:28.110> so<00:04:29.009> we've<00:04:29.280> got<00:04:29.400> three

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669

it's one teaspoon five times a day and

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.779 
it's one teaspoon five times a day and
if<00:04:36.419> you're<00:04:36.629> not<00:04:36.900> training<00:04:37.349> on<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.280> off<00:04:38.460> days

get a little bit shine a little bit wary
of<00:04:46.349> creatine<00:04:47.189> a<00:04:47.750> because<00:04:48.750> they<00:04:49.080> don't<00:04:49.319> take<00:04:49.590> it

I<00:04:57.300> think<00:04:57.659> that<00:04:57.810> you'll<00:04:57.990> find<00:04:58.349> a<00:04:58.469> different

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
I think that you'll find a different

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.110 
I think that you'll find a different
result<00:04:59.689> secondly<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:02.219> what's<00:05:02.550> known<00:05:02.819> as<00:05:03.090> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
result secondly it is what's known as a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.080 
result secondly it is what's known as a
cell<00:05:03.599> volumizer<00:05:04.289> that<00:05:05.069> means<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.759> will

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
cell volumizer that means it will

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.350 
cell volumizer that means it will
increase<00:05:06.840> water<00:05:07.650> within<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> cell<00:05:08.879> but

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
increase water within the cell but

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.110 
increase water within the cell but
that's<00:05:10.050> fantastic<00:05:10.289> because<00:05:11.069> that<00:05:11.520> means<00:05:11.789> an

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
that's fantastic because that means an

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.219 
that's fantastic because that means an
improve<00:05:12.990> nutrient<00:05:13.800> flow<00:05:14.039> to<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.430> muscle<00:05:15.229> so

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
improve nutrient flow to the muscle so

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.320 
improve nutrient flow to the muscle so
what<00:05:16.439> does<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.830> mean<00:05:17.099> that<00:05:17.759> means<00:05:17.969> more

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
what does that mean that means more

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.469

growth and better recovery so look at
