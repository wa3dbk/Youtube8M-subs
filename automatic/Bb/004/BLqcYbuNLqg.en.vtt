easier<00:00:44.040> well<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.660> kill

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
easier well you don't really need kill

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.240 
easier well you don't really need kill
account<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.260> need<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.829> able<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> get

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
account you just need to be able to get

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
account you just need to be able to get
the<00:00:47.370> keys<00:00:47.640> wall<00:00:48.210> well<00:00:48.930> from<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> kill<00:00:49.469> account

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the keys wall well from the kill account

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
the keys wall well from the kill account
I<00:00:50.010> guess<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.390> there's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I guess so you don't need there's not a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
I guess so you don't need there's not a
requirement<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.649> kill<00:00:52.860> account<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.550> only

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
requirement of kill account the only

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
requirement of kill account the only
thing<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.270> need<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.809> inside<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
thing that you need to get inside the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.430 
thing that you need to get inside the
boss<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.800> 4000<00:00:56.190> count<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.660> first<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> need

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
boss is 4000 count but first you need

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.599 
boss is 4000 count but first you need
the<00:00:58.590> key<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.250> there

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the key to get in there

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.279 
the key to get in there
so<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.030> frozen<00:01:00.300> key<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.140> have

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so this frozen key that you have

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.860 
so this frozen key that you have
constructed<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.160> has<00:01:02.399> five<00:01:02.760> uses<00:01:03.239> that's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
constructed it has five uses that's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
constructed it has five uses that's
pretty<00:01:04.170> nice<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.710> expecting<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.460> didn't

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pretty nice I was expecting I didn't

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.000 
pretty nice I was expecting I didn't
know<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.299> until<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> key<00:01:07.260> until<00:01:07.950> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
know this until I made the key until you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.770 
know this until I made the key until you
right-click<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.790> check<00:01:08.970> uses<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.659> have

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
right-click it and check uses you have

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
right-click it and check uses you have
five<00:01:09.990> uses<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> key<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.280> guessing<00:01:11.729> one

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
five uses with the key I'm guessing one

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.429 
five uses with the key I'm guessing one
to<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.750> five<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to use for the the five it's going to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
to use for the the five it's going to
explode<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.159> inventory<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.760> never

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
explode in your inventory it's never

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
explode in your inventory it's never
gonna<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> seen<00:01:15.420> again<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.680> gonna

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
gonna be seen again and you're gonna

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
gonna be seen again and you're gonna
have<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> pieces<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:18.030> over

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
have to go and get the pieces all over

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.710 
have to go and get the pieces all over
again

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
again

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
again
but<00:01:18.840> um<00:01:19.490> yeah<00:01:20.490> five<00:01:20.850> uses<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.509> pretty

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
but um yeah five uses that's pretty

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.530 
but um yeah five uses that's pretty
decent<00:01:22.560> considering<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> figured

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
decent considering you know I figured

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.880 
decent considering you know I figured
you're<00:01:24.930> gonna<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> every

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you're gonna have to do this every
