engineer 775 here I'm going to show you
some<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.100> the<00:00:18.160> steps<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.760> putting<00:00:19.060> in<00:00:19.150> a<00:00:19.240> slow

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
some of the steps of putting in a slow

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.120 
some of the steps of putting in a slow
pump<00:00:20.140> in<00:00:20.590> a<00:00:21.570> difficult<00:00:22.570> terrain<00:00:23.350> situation

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
pump in a difficult terrain situation

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.460 
pump in a difficult terrain situation
I'm<00:00:24.250> on<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.490> side<00:00:24.700> of<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.910> mountain<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.260> we're

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
I'm on the side of a mountain and we're

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.269 
I'm on the side of a mountain and we're
collecting<00:00:26.830> spring<00:00:27.130> water<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.900> is<00:00:29.020> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
collecting spring water and there is a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.519 
collecting spring water and there is a
shared<00:00:30.300> source<00:00:31.300> of<00:00:31.570> water<00:00:31.780> here<00:00:32.050> with<00:00:32.379> two

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
shared source of water here with two

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.910 
shared source of water here with two
neighbors<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.180> we're<00:00:34.180> filling<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.809> tank<00:00:35.379> one

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
neighbors and we're filling a tank one

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640 
neighbors and we're filling a tank one
tank<00:00:36.190> has<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> electric<00:00:37.120> pump<00:00:37.330> in<00:00:37.480> it<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.809> then

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
tank has a electric pump in it and then

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.560 
tank has a electric pump in it and then
the<00:00:38.860> other<00:00:39.100> tank<00:00:39.580> is<00:00:39.790> going<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.000> capture<00:00:40.330> the

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
the other tank is going to capture the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.229 
the other tank is going to capture the
overflow<00:00:41.170> from<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.500> first<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.190> from<00:00:43.059> that

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
overflow from the first and from that

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.650 
overflow from the first and from that
we'll<00:00:43.420> use<00:00:43.449> a<00:00:44.019> tank<00:00:45.010> off<00:00:45.250> slow<00:00:45.610> pump<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.480> pump

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
we'll use a tank off slow pump to pump

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.600 
we'll use a tank off slow pump to pump
up<00:00:46.870> about<00:00:47.700> 270<00:00:48.700> feet<00:00:49.380> over<00:00:50.380> a<00:00:50.410> 800<00:00:51.100> foot<00:00:51.280> linear

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
up about 270 feet over a 800 foot linear

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.840 
up about 270 feet over a 800 foot linear
distance<00:00:51.970> but<00:00:52.270> 270<00:00:52.870> foot<00:00:52.989> elevation<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.850> so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
distance but 270 foot elevation and so

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.660 
distance but 270 foot elevation and so
I'll<00:00:55.270> show<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.480> what<00:00:55.600> I'm<00:00:55.690> doing<00:00:56.309> again<00:00:57.309> there

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
I'll show you what I'm doing again there

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.250 
I'll show you what I'm doing again there
if<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.180> can<00:00:58.300> see<00:00:58.329> it<00:00:58.690> up<00:00:58.809> in<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.020> woods

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
if you can see it up in the woods

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.139 
if you can see it up in the woods
there's<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.530> spring<00:00:59.950> box<00:01:00.160> it's<00:01:00.430> collecting<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
there's a spring box it's collecting the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.619 
there's a spring box it's collecting the
spring<00:01:01.510> order<00:01:02.260> at<00:01:02.350> its<00:01:02.500> head<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.070> then<00:01:04.030> coming

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
spring order at its head and then coming

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.930 
spring order at its head and then coming
down<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:05.050> a<00:01:05.080> tank<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:05.770> which<00:01:06.640> has<00:01:06.820> an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
down to a tank here which has an

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.889 
down to a tank here which has an
overflow<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:08.229> will<00:01:08.440> fill<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.910> big<00:01:10.210> tank

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
overflow that will fill the big tank

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.020 
overflow that will fill the big tank
it's<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.170> 2500<00:01:11.890> gallon<00:01:12.280> cistern<00:01:13.210> our<00:01:14.580> solar<00:01:15.580> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
it's a 2500 gallon cistern our solar and

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.639 
it's a 2500 gallon cistern our solar and
to<00:01:16.750> run<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.140> pump<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.649> around<00:01:18.490> 500<00:01:19.090> feet<00:01:19.240> away

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
to run this pump is around 500 feet away

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.870 
to run this pump is around 500 feet away
using<00:01:20.649> a<00:01:20.800> real<00:01:21.459> heavy<00:01:21.700> number<00:01:21.940> six<00:01:22.410> wire<00:01:23.410> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
using a real heavy number six wire and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.669 
using a real heavy number six wire and
so<00:01:24.880> we<00:01:25.000> minimize<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.720> voltage<00:01:26.050> drop<00:01:26.380> that's

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
so we minimize the voltage drop that's

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.150 
so we minimize the voltage drop that's
coming<00:01:27.069> down<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.520> long<00:01:27.910> ways<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.979> going<00:01:30.099> to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
coming down a long ways and I'm going to

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.350 
coming down a long ways and I'm going to
be<00:01:30.250> using<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:31.179> this<00:01:31.420> tank<00:01:32.110> off<00:01:32.940> 13:04<00:01:34.000> this

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
be using the on this tank off 13:04 this

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.609 
be using the on this tank off 13:04 this
is<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.509> 48<00:01:34.929> volt<00:01:35.160> motor<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.539> pump<00:01:37.539> setup<00:01:38.050> I'm

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
is a 48 volt motor and pump setup I'm

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.529 
is a 48 volt motor and pump setup I'm
going<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:38.920> pumping<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:39.429> spring<00:01:39.759> water<00:01:40.000> up

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
going to be pumping this spring water up

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.779 
going to be pumping this spring water up
to<00:01:40.599> two<00:01:41.200> tanks<00:01:41.770> on<00:01:42.039> top<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.459> mountain

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
to two tanks on top of the mountain

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.180 
to two tanks on top of the mountain
we're<00:01:43.660> going<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> pre-filter<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.950> 10

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
we're going to pre-filter it the 10

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.400 
we're going to pre-filter it the 10
micron<00:01:45.610> filter<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.599> then<00:01:47.080> we're<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.380> to

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
micron filter and then we're going to

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.469 
micron filter and then we're going to
use<00:01:47.470> a<00:01:47.649> linear<00:01:47.979> current<00:01:48.399> booster<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:50.229> will

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
use a linear current booster that will

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
use a linear current booster that will
basically<00:01:52.479> optimize<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:53.319> light<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.759> terms<00:01:55.119> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
basically optimize the light in terms of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.889 
basically optimize the light in terms of
pumping<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.860> lot<00:01:57.069> more<00:01:57.340> water<00:01:57.910> per<00:01:58.330> day<00:01:58.360> about

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
pumping a lot more water per day about

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.820 
pumping a lot more water per day about
40%<00:01:59.590> more<00:01:59.759> than<00:02:00.759> if<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.090> ran<00:02:01.630> solar<00:02:02.349> direct

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
40% more than if I just ran solar direct

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.219 
40% more than if I just ran solar direct
to<00:02:03.009> this<00:02:03.130> motor<00:02:03.759> so<00:02:04.450> it's<00:02:04.599> a<00:02:04.660> great<00:02:04.989> little

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
to this motor so it's a great little

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.779 
to this motor so it's a great little
thing<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:05.950> called<00:02:06.099> a<00:02:06.130> linear<00:02:06.310> current

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
thing it's called a linear current

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.279 
thing it's called a linear current
booster<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.209> used<00:02:07.420> amount<00:02:07.660> several<00:02:07.989> different

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
booster of used amount several different

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.130 
booster of used amount several different
things<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.910> we'll<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.270> wiring<00:02:10.780> into<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
things and so we'll be wiring into the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.190 
things and so we'll be wiring into the
LCB<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.580> linear<00:02:12.760> current<00:02:13.000> booster<00:02:13.239> and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
LCB that's a linear current booster and

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.170 
LCB that's a linear current booster and
then<00:02:14.380> I've<00:02:14.500> added<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:15.040> just<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.670> simple<00:02:16.000> toggle

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
then I've added a just a simple toggle

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.479 
then I've added a just a simple toggle
switch<00:02:16.569> down<00:02:16.780> here<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.739> needed<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.340> do

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
switch down here so if you needed to do

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.710 
switch down here so if you needed to do
any<00:02:18.670> maintenance<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.330> shut<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.690> thing

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
any maintenance you can shut the thing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.470 
any maintenance you can shut the thing
off<00:02:20.020> without<00:02:20.800> having<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.340> open<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.120> up<00:02:22.300> and
