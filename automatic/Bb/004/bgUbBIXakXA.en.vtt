that's dripping down into the tank and
to<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.649> overflow<00:00:52.000> same<00:00:53.000> principle<00:00:53.510> as<00:00:53.539> my

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
to the overflow same principle as my

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.979 
to the overflow same principle as my
other<00:00:53.899> ones<00:00:54.730> I've<00:00:55.730> got<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.059> hole<00:00:56.510> for<00:00:56.840> my

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
other ones I've got a hole for my

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.220 
other ones I've got a hole for my
waterline<00:00:57.500> right<00:00:57.920> about<00:00:58.129> there<00:00:58.870> water<00:00:59.870> drains

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
waterline right about there water drains

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.260 
waterline right about there water drains
into<00:01:00.469> there<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.070> as<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.520> water<00:01:01.550> reaches<00:01:02.120> the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
into there and as the water reaches the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.290 
into there and as the water reaches the
level<00:01:02.680> siphons<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.949> overflow<00:01:04.220> tube<00:01:04.699> down

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
level siphons to the overflow tube down

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.330 
level siphons to the overflow tube down
to<00:01:05.509> here<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:05.960> then<00:01:06.020> once<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.740> water<00:01:06.920> reaches

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
to here and then once the water reaches

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.300 
to here and then once the water reaches
here<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:09.080> going<00:01:09.259> to<00:01:09.289> overflow<00:01:09.649> down<00:01:10.039> into

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
here it's going to overflow down into

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.660 
here it's going to overflow down into
this<00:01:10.490> tube<00:01:10.759> siphon<00:01:11.270> out<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:13.369> will<00:01:13.550> only

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
this tube siphon out and this will only

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.109 
this tube siphon out and this will only
flow<00:01:14.360> as<00:01:14.690> much<00:01:14.929> as<00:01:15.170> I'm<00:01:15.740> dripping<00:01:16.039> as<00:01:16.340> much<00:01:16.940> as

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
flow as much as I'm dripping as much as

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.210 
flow as much as I'm dripping as much as
flowing<00:01:17.570> extra<00:01:17.929> through<00:01:18.140> there<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.070> not

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
flowing extra through there so it's not

other side there that is that and that
comes<00:01:53.830> off<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:55.510> one<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.720> did<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.960> quick<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
comes off on this one I did a quick this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.930 
comes off on this one I did a quick this
cruising<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.800> it's<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.100> quick<00:02:00.430> release<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:00.850> I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
cruising and it's a quick release so I

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.150 
cruising and it's a quick release so I
can<00:02:01.090> pull<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.360> off<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.950> reprime<00:02:02.950> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
can pull this off and reprime the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.070 
can pull this off and reprime the
overflowing<00:02:03.850> no<00:02:04.119> problem<00:02:04.570> i<00:02:04.690> did<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.960> this

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
overflowing no problem i did that this

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.290 
overflowing no problem i did that this
morning<00:02:05.140> took<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.770> five<00:02:05.950> seconds<00:02:06.369> all<00:02:07.240> right

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
morning took like five seconds all right

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.889 
morning took like five seconds all right
and<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.720> pulls<00:02:08.259> down<00:02:08.470> under<00:02:08.830> there

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
and the pulls down under there

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.080 
and the pulls down under there
there's<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.680> work<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.250> I've<00:02:12.459> got<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> tea

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
there's the work and I've got a tea

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.630 
there's the work and I've got a tea
coming<00:02:13.390> off<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.049> leads<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.640> this

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
coming off and that leads up to this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.309 
coming off and that leads up to this
other<00:02:15.879> overflow<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.629> one's<00:02:16.780> built<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.110> little

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
other overflow this one's built a little

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.710 
other overflow this one's built a little
bit<00:02:17.409> differently<00:02:18.180> unlike<00:02:19.180> my<00:02:19.329> other<00:02:19.360> ones

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
bit differently unlike my other ones

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500 
bit differently unlike my other ones
that<00:02:19.840> doesn't<00:02:20.140> have<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.489> one<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.939> usually

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
that doesn't have on this one I usually

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.410 
that doesn't have on this one I usually
have<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> tea<00:02:23.519> but<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.549> got<00:02:24.849> home<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.269> got

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
have a tea but I got home I got

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.550 
have a tea but I got home I got
everything<00:02:25.720> set<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.200> was<00:02:26.319> put<00:02:26.470> them

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
everything set up and I was put them

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.140 
everything set up and I was put them
together<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:27.010> like<00:02:27.159> a<00:02:27.250> crap<00:02:27.670> i<00:02:27.700> forgot<00:02:27.849> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
together I was like a crap i forgot a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.690 
together I was like a crap i forgot a
team<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.109> just<00:02:29.530> drill<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.829> top<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.159> that<00:02:30.280> same

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
team so just drill the top of that same

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.770 
team so just drill the top of that same
principle<00:02:30.879> works<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.540> same

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
principle works the same

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.910 
principle works the same
looks<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.470> little<00:02:33.640> more<00:02:34.640> symmetrical<00:02:35.770> which<00:02:36.770> I

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
looks a little more symmetrical which I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.949 
looks a little more symmetrical which I
like<00:02:37.959> but<00:02:38.959> again<00:02:40.120> overflows<00:02:41.120> got<00:02:41.660> a<00:02:41.690> water

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
like but again overflows got a water

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.809 
like but again overflows got a water
line<00:02:42.230> hole<00:02:42.500> right<00:02:42.680> there<00:02:42.740> then<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.430> can<00:02:43.580> see

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
line hole right there then you can see

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.380 
line hole right there then you can see
it<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.930> need<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.170> get<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:46.120> leaf<00:02:47.120> out<00:02:47.330> of

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it and I need to get this leaf out of

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.500 
it and I need to get this leaf out of
don't<00:02:48.350> want<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.620> gave<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> clogged<00:02:49.190> up

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
don't want that gave a clogged up

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.990 
don't want that gave a clogged up
and<00:02:51.080> safe<00:02:51.560> principle<00:02:52.040> overflows<00:02:52.519> down<00:02:52.760> there

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and safe principle overflows down there

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.640 
and safe principle overflows down there
once<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.390> reaches<00:02:53.659> this<00:02:53.810> level<00:02:53.870> where<00:02:54.439> i<00:02:54.470> could

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
once it reaches this level where i could

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.119 
once it reaches this level where i could
grain<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.159> drains<00:02:55.430> out<00:02:55.750> also<00:02:56.829> draining<00:02:57.829> at

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
grain it drains out also draining at

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.369 
grain it drains out also draining at
point<00:02:58.700> five<00:02:58.909> gallons<00:02:59.480> per<00:02:59.659> hour<00:02:59.720> there's<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
point five gallons per hour there's the

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.550 
point five gallons per hour there's the
dripper<00:03:00.620> right<00:03:00.860> there<00:03:01.120> then<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.569> works

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
dripper right there then this one works

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.960 
dripper right there then this one works

its way down tees off the main line

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.789 
its way down tees off the main line
alright<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.629> you<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.900> see<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.110> got<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.349> tee<00:03:09.620> down

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
alright as you can see I got a tee down

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.699 
alright as you can see I got a tee down
here<00:03:10.129> this<00:03:10.849> one's<00:03:11.090> coming<00:03:11.390> from<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.599> 75<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.260> 55

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
here this one's coming from the 75 to 55

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.380 
here this one's coming from the 75 to 55
and<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:12.980> one's<00:03:13.159> more<00:03:13.400> or<00:03:13.549> less<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.909> output

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and this one's more or less the output

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.130 
and this one's more or less the output
that<00:03:15.290> goes<00:03:15.500> underneath<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.980> couch<00:03:17.019> want<00:03:18.019> to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
that goes underneath the couch want to

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.190 
that goes underneath the couch want to
lounge<00:03:18.319> whatever<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.250> want<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.430> call<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.609> and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
lounge whatever you want to call it and

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.110 
lounge whatever you want to call it and
you<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.319> see<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.650> I've<00:03:22.280> got<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.519> kind<00:03:22.909> of<00:03:22.940> up

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
you can see it I've got it kind of up

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.599 
you can see it I've got it kind of up
right<00:03:23.359> here<00:03:23.540> because<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:23.989> one<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:25.430> one

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
right here because this one was this one

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.789 
right here because this one was this one
was<00:03:25.790> siphoning<00:03:26.239> down<00:03:26.450> into<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.109> I<00:03:27.140> take

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
was siphoning down into that so I take

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:38.140 
was siphoning down into that so I take
this<00:03:28.040> up<00:03:35.739> one<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.829> my<00:03:36.859> lights<00:03:37.159> over<00:03:37.430> here<00:03:37.609> get

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
this up one of my lights over here get

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.210 
this up one of my lights over here get
this<00:03:38.299> taped<00:03:38.599> up<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.200> don't<00:03:40.040> have<00:03:40.129> to

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
this taped up so that don't have to

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.740 
this taped up so that don't have to
worry<00:03:40.400> about<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.819> one<00:03:41.060> draining<00:03:41.420> into<00:03:41.569> that

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
worry about this one draining into that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.390 
worry about this one draining into that
one<00:03:41.959> or<00:03:42.049> maybe<00:03:42.200> backflow<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> just<00:03:43.190> didn't

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
one or maybe backflow and I just didn't

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.940 
one or maybe backflow and I just didn't
want<00:03:43.519> have<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.760> worry<00:03:43.940> about<00:03:44.060> any<00:03:44.329> issues<00:03:44.950> with

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
want have to worry about any issues with

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.830 
want have to worry about any issues with
these<00:03:46.159> ones<00:03:46.400> with<00:03:46.970> these<00:03:47.180> connections<00:03:47.540> right

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
these ones with these connections right

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.050 
these ones with these connections right
here<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.109> got<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.349> be<00:03:48.440> careful<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.790> really

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
here you got to be careful you really

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.539 
here you got to be careful you really
got<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.329> cut<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.599> line<00:03:50.780> even<00:03:50.989> straight<00:03:51.829> 90

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
got to cut the line even straight 90

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.860 
got to cut the line even straight 90
degrees<00:03:52.819> and<00:03:53.030> really<00:03:53.299> just<00:03:53.420> put<00:03:53.659> them<00:03:53.750> in

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
but yeah that's the drip system i'd say

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.110 
but yeah that's the drip system i'd say
probably<00:05:13.170> eighty<00:05:13.740> percent<00:05:13.980> done<00:05:14.400> still<00:05:15.000> got

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
probably eighty percent done still got

probably eighty percent done still got
some<00:05:15.180> tweaking<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.660> do<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:15.960> course<00:05:16.170> but<00:05:17.690> yeah

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690
