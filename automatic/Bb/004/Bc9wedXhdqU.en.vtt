you're coming out with that only works
with<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.730> Kinect<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.630> will<00:02:36.780> even<00:02:37.140> change<00:02:37.170> my

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
with the Kinect that will even change my

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.770 
with the Kinect that will even change my
mind<00:02:38.220> about<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.760> Kinect<00:02:39.090> which<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
mind about the Kinect which I think the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690 
mind about the Kinect which I think the
Kinect<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.200> an<00:02:40.349> absolute<00:02:40.890> piece<00:02:41.069> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
Kinect is an absolute piece of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.360 
Kinect is an absolute piece of
you<00:02:42.420> killed<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.470> Kinect<00:02:43.769> by<00:02:43.920> doing<00:02:44.250> this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you killed the Kinect by doing this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.490 
you killed the Kinect by doing this
which<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.940> okay<00:02:45.269> because<00:02:45.600> honestly<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.170> wanted

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
which is okay because honestly I wanted

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.970 
which is okay because honestly I wanted
the<00:02:46.650> Kinect<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.069> die<00:02:47.690> look<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.380> reality<00:02:49.590> of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the Kinect to die look the reality of

future is I really think this is gonna
happen<00:03:21.540> with<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.900> Kinect<00:03:22.170> Microsoft<00:03:22.680> is

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
happen with the Kinect Microsoft is

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.830 
happen with the Kinect Microsoft is
gonna<00:03:22.920> quietly<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.359> year<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> half

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
gonna quietly like in a year and a half

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.420 
gonna quietly like in a year and a half
two<00:03:25.079> years<00:03:25.109> maybe<00:03:25.799> even<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.100> little<00:03:26.160> less

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
two years maybe even a little less

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.190 
two years maybe even a little less
because<00:03:26.579> hell<00:03:26.850> they<00:03:27.000> got<00:03:27.510> rid<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.780> they're

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
coming out with the Xbox one Kinect was

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.630 
coming out with the Xbox one Kinect was
bundle<00:03:31.890> much<00:03:32.069> quicker<00:03:32.310> than<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.549> thought

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
bundle much quicker than I thought

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.750 
bundle much quicker than I thought
they're<00:03:33.540> gonna<00:03:33.690> quietly<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.709> know<00:03:34.739> sweep<00:03:35.579> the
