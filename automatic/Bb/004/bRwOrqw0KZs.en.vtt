00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 primark belongs to the group something for 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.820
 social ends picture is initially 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340

 the first clothing store in dublin 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 and the success story of primark 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.399
 talented but the work out principle 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 differs significantly from that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.039
 the other big fashion chain primark 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 takes fashion trends extra 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.730
 fast moves but on price 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.559
 the level of hans m &amp; g also what the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.300
 shopping atmosphere itself primark 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.530
 against all trends on the fight and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.820
 Ramsch principle most 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 Clothing stores try the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.780
 To buy as pleasant as possible 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.589
 that means there is a lot of space 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 seating and the customer will 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.619
 throughout with background music 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.450
 however, modest primark has neither 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.220
 music still seating and only 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 no space for the sales area 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 is delivered with clothesstands and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 rummages and still works 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 antonella danone professor for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.080
 Apparel sociologist believes the reason 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.090
 to know for it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.890
 we can all be ourselves you can 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.570
 all touch everything try not 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.920
 Seller observes you mean that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.240
 the fashion more and more important for ours 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 society has become and especially 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.960
 Teenagers are trying their best too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.700
 its the question what i am attracting today 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.990
 has become essential Freimark 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.460
 does not allow teens yet 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 To have so much money available 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.369
 to be up to date 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.200
 The target group are teenagers in the lead 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.909
 Girl the fashion chain is putting on mass 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.130
 the meshes so the profit margins 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 are between 10 and 12 that is not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 much but the sales volume makes 2013 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.329
 primark made about 625 million euros 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
 profit per square meter of sales area 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.049
 the group achieves over 6,000 euros 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.549
 other big chains can not do that 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.350
 keep up with the prices are so low 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.149
 Many customers fall into one 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.710
 Kaufrausch the mode becomes aweckwerth 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.000
 Product as it quickly by others 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.799
 cheap parts can be replaced 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.719
 sustainability at primark is not 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.009
 the group can save the subject of advertising 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.780
 costs in the social networks 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.430
 Adolescents exchange themselves automatically 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.620
 also youtube for primark 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.239
 free 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.680
 the platform has become as many there 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.319
 their wood presents the fashion discounter 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.830
 offers in contrast to most 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.720
 textile stores none online 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 Shipment can be bought only 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.629
 In the business this cheap policy becomes 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.489
 primark from different sides always 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.930
 accused again because that means 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.730
 that can be saved on other corners 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.989
 must be nurtured in production 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.579
 The accusation of exploitation of 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.870
 workers also by the fact that the chain 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.190
 neither the addresses of your factory 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.019
 locations still publishes the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.459
 countries of origin on their label printing 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.319
 Paul Lester is the head of the department 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.849
 ethical trade yes such a department 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.590
 is there really he rejects the charge 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.299
 the exploitation back they leave alike 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.799
 like all others, but they produce 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.660
 You can order larger quantities 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.859
 clothes also offer cheaper primax 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.120
 but it is the aim of the work and 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.470
 production conditions for the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.760
 to improve employees 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.140
 the ethics chef says that they all 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.910
 Have factory locations checked 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.799
 Especially after the factory became cleaner 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.480
 plasa in Bangladesh collapsed in the 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.489
 let them produce even primark 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.019
 so far â‚¬ 2.4 million in compensation 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.150
 for the workers there paid the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.950
 Fashion chain lets in about 1200 factories 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.989
 produce most are in 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.640
 asia list explained that my last one 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.470
 year 2000 inspections alone 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 have carried out prioritization 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.129
 all the most endangered in 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.109
 Bangladesh are 40 out of a total of 88 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.030
 locations primax goal is ethical 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.459
 to create responsible fashion 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.840
 they want to be toxic to all by 2020 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.530
 chemicals in the garments 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.269
 renounce 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.829
 not even on the products then 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.430
 you know that until then probably one more 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.290
 long way 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.970
 in fact, primark is open for 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.919
 criticism and trying to make a difference 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.750
 that confirm different environment and 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.250
 human rights organization greenpeace 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.169
 thinks I'm just not in principle 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.940
 bad and luxury market is not 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.049
 be good in principle, too 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.040
 let luxury brands under 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.290
 inhumane conditions 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.060
 produces for example wage increases for 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.650
 To bring about the complete must 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.239
 industry with pulling the prices will be 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.769
 namely paid by the suppliers 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
 work again for other brands 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.980
 that means a closer working both 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.540
 for private as well as for pastor 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.069
 Changes must therefore be made by the 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.359
 industry get along for the nearer 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.430
 are the weakest link in the chain 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.010
 and especially leading companies like primark 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.690
 should have a pioneering role 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.310
