00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.420
 I think that led two different half-time 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.420
 first half 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.100
 inside the plan was such a play 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.200
 almost strictly defensively released 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.660
 a large number of players 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.390
 defensive plan displeasure 1 0 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.430
 missed the brushes with their standard 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 break made permutations in the calculation 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 for more the same action of my team 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 I had to recoup and the teacher what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 zenith played two days ago the hardest 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.380
 harder screw against seville thought that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.250
 the team is physically a little fit and 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.300
 I think that 2 there were very very 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.480
 well aware of the moments in which 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.640
 In general, the moments played great 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.910
 controlled the ball but unfortunately not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 wanted the most important goals scored 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.050
 not enough implementation anyway 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.910
 if not ashamed of the team, I think that we 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.700
 looked very dignified against 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.030
 the teams that I count to 90 here 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.330
 percent champion vladimir kolos partisan 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 . 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
 Dmitry android this season is already 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.300
 played with the zenith three times and all three matches 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.550
 they were different at first there was a rout in 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.920
 bullet then your great victory in peter 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.380
 in the cup and now quite complex 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
 labor victory zenith is what we saw 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.240
 different view 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.130
 or it was still a different arsenal 1 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.640
 I want to say that all these three games were 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.500
 in my opinion it is very interesting to understand 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.320
 that the first two games there were a lot, 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 heads of intrigue was above the meeting button 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 Today, despite something, I think that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.130
 the viewer should like football in 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.570
 to some extent 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 final arsenal that's still for 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 compared with the first round when of them 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.330
 I came to Tulu I think we added 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.780
 great added gained confidence 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.610
 Teamwork and the guys the guys understand that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.200
 you can even with such teams with such 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.770
 strong teams how to change to 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.099
 departure 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.650
 the game the darkness on the forty machine guns on the frames i 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.540
 I think we all have the right to congratulate you on 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.410
 good game especially really 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.209
 the second half and watched with interesting 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.180
 Big follow your activity 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.700
 coaching course of course that you 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.260
 significantly less players 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 overseas high class and you 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.489
 completely different other material 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.380
 opportunities and in connection with this question 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.830
 Do you believe that the Russian 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.110
 football players if they limit the number 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.390
 foreigners you can invite 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.280
 and that is why there will be a question what with 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 your point of view should be 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.500
 number of foreigners in our teams 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.170
 but can Russian footballers and 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.930
 Russian children's coaches 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.700
 grow players of your level 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.400
 arshavin and and so on so that 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.860
 our football level did not fall at 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.180
 restricting the purchase of overseas 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.840
 football players you know 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.530
 I can not yet decided 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.379
 know with your opinion about the limit 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.349
 because now there is a lot of discussion 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.719
 10-15 746 then I somehow don’t want to find 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.109
 Now talk on this topic but I can 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:26.959
 One thing to say is that of course if such 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.959
 football players which does not have zenith 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.359
 when they hulk hisrah the Libyans will 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.189
 many others random then there roofs here 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.959
 you can list of course they only 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.980
 Decorates our championship Russia I only I 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.780
 two hands for 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.209
 so that these players I 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.500
 Listed was as much as possible the beginning 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.720
 your account nadya something very 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.200
 then it will only grow this first 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.310
 the second 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.329
 Of course, I think that in our country 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.219
 there are so many talents and I always am 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.099
 spoke and remained unconvinced that 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.590
 if our coach will trust our 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.850
 Russian football players, I am convinced that they 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.070
 can too 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.350
 our team more accurately can make 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.170
 competition in european championships on 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.420
 World Cup most important is trust in 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.640
 no one will convince this world 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.050
 Dmitry longer live for the second year in a row 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.750
 we are two different halves 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.790
 and you talked about what was today 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.340
 protective composition of the first half intentional 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.200
 delivered but was everything possible 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.760
 still here looking at the game itself pocket 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.760
 today's game is different to hold 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:34.040
 its first half is somehow more aggressive 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.050
 to play ban ali thing I will say probably 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.920
 it was already possible to put the same composition as 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.140
 u how we played in the second half 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.760
 the fact that we did not win it 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.560
 we did not lose because accounting 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.380
 so I think that in principle 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:54.230
 principle done right on the basis again 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:55.130
 I don’t think that my opponent’s strength 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.350
 I think that such 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.210
 didn't want us a little bit like Yar's 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.010
 implementation in any case do not want 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.340
 congratulate on the victory 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.130
 I like more want to congratulate 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.810
 We communicate now in private conversation 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.810
 thank you all thanks
