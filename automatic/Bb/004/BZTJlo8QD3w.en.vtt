00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.759 
having other game up you're gonna see
how<00:03:59.099> fast<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.609> comes<00:03:59.790> into<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.389> load<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:01.079> do

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
how fast it comes into the load and do

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.580 
how fast it comes into the load and do
its<00:04:01.950> thing<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.959> that's<00:04:03.959> important<00:04:04.560> because

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
its thing and that's important because

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.729 
its thing and that's important because
that<00:04:05.069> slows<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.430> down<00:04:05.599> when<00:04:06.599> you<00:04:06.989> do<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.349> so

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
that slows you down when you do that so

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.349 
that slows you down when you do that so
what's<00:04:07.980> gonna<00:04:08.069> happen<00:04:08.160> now<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:09.030> see<00:04:09.209> me
