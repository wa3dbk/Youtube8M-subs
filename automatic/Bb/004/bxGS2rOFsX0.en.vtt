cube ZZ is located in China and the
shipping<00:00:32.219> took<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.960> 9<00:00:34.440> days

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
shipping took I think around 9 days
which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.790> too<00:00:36.059> bad<00:00:36.090> considering

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

it's coming from China and there was a
snowstorm<00:00:39.950> around<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.110> is<00:00:43.110> actually

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
snowstorm around me so that is actually

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
snowstorm around me so that is actually
quite<00:00:44.070> fast<00:00:44.460> shipping<00:00:45.230> but<00:00:46.850> looking<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.059> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
though starting with the Gans 3 first
thing<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.100> noticed<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.330> stickered

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
thing I noticed is that is not stickered
already<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.549> sticker<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.939> on

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
already so I will have to sticker it on

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.429 
already so I will have to sticker it on
my<00:01:27.240> own<00:01:28.700> there's<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.090> logo<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.380> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
my own there's the logo it's kind of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
my own there's the logo it's kind of
ugly<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.189> probably<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> on

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
ugly so I'm probably not gonna put it on

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.950 
ugly so I'm probably not gonna put it on
there<00:01:34.040> then<00:01:35.420> here<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> puzzle<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
there then here is the puzzle so the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
there then here is the puzzle so the
pieces<00:01:40.200> are<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> weird<00:01:40.920> shaped<00:01:41.280> I've

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pieces are kind of weird shaped I've

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
pieces are kind of weird shaped I've
never<00:01:41.820> owned<00:01:42.000> against<00:01:42.329> three<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.049> maybe

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
never owned against three so maybe

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929 
never owned against three so maybe
that's<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.460> pieces<00:01:44.670> are

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that's the way all the pieces are

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.990 
that's the way all the pieces are
normally<00:01:45.270> shaped<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.640> starting<00:01:47.640> off<00:01:47.729> with

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
normally shaped but starting off with

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.480 
normally shaped but starting off with
first<00:01:48.210> turn<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:50.810> tensions<00:01:51.890> pretty<00:01:52.890> decent

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.270 

and<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.670> very<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.240> fast<00:02:00.539> out-of-the-box

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and it's very very fast out-of-the-box

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.399 
and it's very very fast out-of-the-box
I'm<00:02:02.280> quite<00:02:02.880> impressed<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> probably<00:02:04.229> not

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I'm quite impressed with it probably not

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.080 
I'm quite impressed with it probably not
gonna<00:02:04.560> live<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
gonna live it because I'm not really

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.669 
gonna live it because I'm not really
sure<00:02:06.299> where<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.539> would<00:02:06.659> live<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> considering

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
sure where I would live it considering

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.780 
sure where I would live it considering
this<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> puzzle<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> octopus<00:02:09.810> core

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
this is the puzzle with the octopus core

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.339 
this is the puzzle with the octopus core
you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> wasn't<00:02:12.420> thinking<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.170> was

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
you know I wasn't thinking this was

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.780 
you know I wasn't thinking this was
going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> become<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.860> man<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.459> thought<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
going to become a man so I thought that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.250 
going to become a man so I thought that
it<00:02:14.849> would<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.000> cool<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.450> yellow<00:02:15.750> cube

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it would be cool to have a yellow cube

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.220 
it would be cool to have a yellow cube
one<00:02:17.220> side<00:02:17.370> sticker<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> few<00:02:18.959> songs

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
one side sticker it and do a few songs

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.500 
one side sticker it and do a few songs
with<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.650> we'll<00:02:20.549> see<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> affects<00:02:21.299> my

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
package we have the mo u o su and then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.080 
package we have the mo u o su and then
unlike<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.049> mo<00:02:34.319> u

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
unlike the mo u

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.479 
unlike the mo u
way<00:02:36.090> still<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.079> get<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.650> puzzle<00:02:38.040> in<00:02:38.190> black

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
way still I do get this puzzle in black

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.610 
way still I do get this puzzle in black
simply<00:02:39.299> because<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> don't<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.110> black<00:02:40.349> for

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
simply because I don't have a black for

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890 
simply because I don't have a black for
my<00:02:40.769> for<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.099> and<00:02:41.280> I've<00:02:41.430> been<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:42.540> enjoying

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
my for it and I've been really enjoying

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.460 
my for it and I've been really enjoying
black<00:02:43.200> cubes<00:02:43.590> lately<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.840> for<00:02:46.260> first

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
black cubes lately so now for first

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:59.180 
black cubes lately so now for first
turns<00:02:55.610> it's<00:02:56.610> quite<00:02:57.030> tight<00:02:57.650> which<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.769> probably

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
turns it's quite tight which is probably

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.140 
turns it's quite tight which is probably
why<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:01.040> too<00:03:02.040> great<00:03:02.310> at<00:03:02.370> corner<00:03:02.850> cutting

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
why it's not too great at corner cutting

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.069 
why it's not too great at corner cutting
right<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:06.000> does<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.780> very

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
right now but it does have a very very

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.039 
right now but it does have a very very
smooth<00:03:07.560> feeling<00:03:08.549> which<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.420> definitely<00:03:09.660> think

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
smooth feeling which I definitely think

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.420 
smooth feeling which I definitely think
will<00:03:10.260> break<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.920> over<00:03:11.489> time<00:03:12.889> however<00:03:13.889> I<00:03:14.130> can

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
will break in over time however I can

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.330 
will break in over time however I can
already<00:03:14.880> tell<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.630> puzzle<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.340> faster

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
already tell that this puzzle is faster

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.620 
already tell that this puzzle is faster
than<00:03:17.609> my<00:03:17.790> waist<00:03:18.030> ooh

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
than my waist ooh

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780 
than my waist ooh
therefore<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> definitely<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.609> going

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
therefore I definitely think it's going

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.030 
therefore I definitely think it's going
to<00:03:20.819> end<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.150> becoming<00:03:21.420> my<00:03:21.660> main<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.709> we'll

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
to end up becoming my main but we'll

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
to end up becoming my main but we'll
have<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.400> see<00:03:23.670> if<00:03:23.700> there's<00:03:23.970> any<00:03:24.120> other<00:03:24.359> flaws

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
have to see if there's any other flaws

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.660 
have to see if there's any other flaws
