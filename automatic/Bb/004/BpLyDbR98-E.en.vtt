00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
well if like I said it doesn't work when

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.830 
well if like I said it doesn't work when
you<00:03:22.730> first<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.060> learned<00:03:23.270> that's<00:03:23.390> what<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.570> did

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
you first I learned that's what I did

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.260 
you first I learned that's what I did
then<00:03:24.380> if<00:03:24.739> like<00:03:25.550> before<00:03:25.880> i<00:03:25.910> actually<00:03:26.030> did

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
then if like before i actually did

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.729 
then if like before i actually did
recheck<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> way<00:03:26.840> back<00:03:26.959> I'm<00:03:27.170> like<00:03:27.410> I'm<00:03:27.560> so
