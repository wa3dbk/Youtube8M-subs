to whiz on with today's final questions
the<00:00:28.019> first<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.460> question<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.970> Kristen

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the first one it's question from Kristen

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.319 
the first one it's question from Kristen
strong<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:32.340> very<00:00:32.460> general<00:00:32.759> question<00:00:32.790> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
strong it's very general question in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.139 
strong it's very general question in
terms<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> drama<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.710> score<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.940> are

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
terms of the drama of a score what are

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
terms of the drama of a score what are
some<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> techniques<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
some of the techniques you use to

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160 
some of the techniques you use to
correlate<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> music<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> action<00:00:39.170> it's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
correlate the music with the action it's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
correlate the music with the action it's
quite<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> tough<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> answer<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
quite a tough one to answer in about a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.650 
quite a tough one to answer in about a
minute<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.899> i'd<00:00:43.620> say<00:00:44.010> maybe<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.850> key<00:00:45.120> concept

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
minute but i'd say maybe one key concept

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.990 
minute but i'd say maybe one key concept
is<00:00:45.809> about<00:00:46.170> connection<00:00:46.920> connection<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
is about connection connection of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500 
is about connection connection of the
music<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> picture<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.300> mean

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
music with the picture so this can mean

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.029 
music with the picture so this can mean
many<00:00:51.660> things<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.110> different<00:00:52.649> circumstances

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
many things in different circumstances

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.930 
many things in different circumstances
but<00:00:53.699> i'm<00:00:54.170> aware<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.230> certain<00:00:55.649> times<00:00:56.550> when

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
but i'm aware of certain times when

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.139 
but i'm aware of certain times when
perhaps<00:00:57.750> i'm<00:00:58.559> trying<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.699> hard<00:00:59.730> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
perhaps i'm trying too hard to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
perhaps i'm trying too hard to
compensate<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.989> something<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> perceive

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
compensate for something that I perceive

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.490 
compensate for something that I perceive
isn't<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.270> picture<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.989> perhaps<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
isn't there in the picture so perhaps a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.270 
isn't there in the picture so perhaps a
car<00:01:04.680> chase<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.840> doesn't<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.960> much<00:01:07.280> kinetic

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
car chase that doesn't have much kinetic

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
car chase that doesn't have much kinetic
energy<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> try<00:01:09.630> too<00:01:09.689> hard<00:01:10.310> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
energy in it if you try too hard to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.010 
energy in it if you try too hard to
really<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.880> something<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.720> music

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
really for something then your music

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
really for something then your music
will<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> disconnect<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> picture

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
will kind of disconnect from the picture

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.880 
will kind of disconnect from the picture
and<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> same<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.590> trying<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and that's the same if you're trying to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
and that's the same if you're trying to
make<00:01:16.979> something<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.580> scarier<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
make something much scarier than it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
make something much scarier than it
actually<00:01:18.509> looks<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.020> screen<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> would

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
actually looks on screen so what I would

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.890 
actually looks on screen so what I would
say<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> always<00:01:20.880> try<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.210> connect<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
say is always try and connect with

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
say is always try and connect with
actually<00:01:22.229> what's<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.770> screen<00:01:22.979> what's

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
actually what's on the screen what's

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.749 
actually what's on the screen what's
happening<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> story<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.890> then

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
happening what the story is and then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.999 
happening what the story is and then
you'll<00:01:27.240> find<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.780> way<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.290> inside<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you'll find a way from the inside of the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
you'll find a way from the inside of the
music<00:01:29.369> outwards<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.750> get<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> point<00:01:31.320> where

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
music outwards to get to a point where

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
music outwards to get to a point where
you're<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:32.009> writing<00:01:32.369> music<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> feels

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you're you're writing music that feels

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
you're you're writing music that feels
like<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.420> whole<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> drama<00:01:34.430> too

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
like it's a whole with the drama too

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.219 
like it's a whole with the drama too
quick<00:01:35.909> answer<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.390> big<00:01:36.720> question<00:01:37.079> but

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
quick answer to a very big question but

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.780 
quick answer to a very big question but
I<00:01:37.259> hoping<00:01:37.439> some<00:01:37.740> tiny<00:01:38.070> may<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> helps<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
I hoping some tiny may that helps and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.140 
I hoping some tiny may that helps and
the<00:01:39.390> second<00:01:39.960> question<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.579> a<00:01:41.579> question<00:01:41.670> that's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the second question is a question that's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.289 
the second question is a question that's
sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> based<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.290> Blaine<00:01:43.619> James

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
sort of based on one from Blaine James

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.609 
sort of based on one from Blaine James
but<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.509> wanted<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> show<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> something

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
but I just wanted to show you something

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
because I think these are excellent ways

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.020 
because I think these are excellent ways
to<00:04:46.139> get<00:04:46.229> yourself<00:04:46.409> into<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:47.250> industry<00:04:47.789> of
