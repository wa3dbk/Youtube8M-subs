00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
the what and the where part of Leafly is

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the what and the where part of Leafly is
you<00:02:15.150> know<00:02:15.209> we<00:02:15.330> have<00:02:15.480> about<00:02:15.599> eight<00:02:15.989> hundred

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you know we have about eight hundred

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.690 
you know we have about eight hundred
strains<00:02:16.709> there's<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.340> know<00:02:17.400> there's<00:02:17.610> an

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
strains there's you know there's an

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.390 
strains there's you know there's an
indica<00:02:18.120> sativa<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.110> hybrid<00:02:19.440> right<00:02:19.620> there's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
indica sativa and a hybrid right there's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.340 
indica sativa and a hybrid right there's
a<00:02:20.459> indica<00:02:21.150> sativa<00:02:21.210> being<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.960> two<00:02:22.110> main

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
a indica sativa being the two main

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.440 
a indica sativa being the two main
strains<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.830> marijuana<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.550> most<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
strains of marijuana and most of the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.090 
strains of marijuana and most of the
marijuana<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.170> available<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.830> some

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
marijuana that's available is some

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.780 
marijuana that's available is some
common

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
common

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.550 
common
you<00:02:26.849> know<00:02:26.939> hybrid<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> two<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:27.930> exactly

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you know hybrid of the two right exactly

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.649 
you know hybrid of the two right exactly
exactly<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.849> go<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.180> dispensary

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
exactly so if you go to a dispensary

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.149 
exactly so if you go to a dispensary
you'll<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.109> wide<00:02:31.650> array<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> different

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
you'll see a wide array of different

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.339 
you'll see a wide array of different
strains<00:02:32.609> and<00:02:32.939> as<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> consumer<00:02:33.780> or<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.959> patient

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
strains and as a consumer or a patient

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.599 
strains and as a consumer or a patient
you<00:02:34.439> don't<00:02:34.469> really<00:02:34.799> know<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.040> we're<00:02:35.129> buying

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
you don't really know what we're buying

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.149 
you don't really know what we're buying
and<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.269> Leafly<00:02:36.689> is<00:02:36.989> built<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.920> premise

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
and so Leafly is built on that premise

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.500 
and so Leafly is built on that premise
so<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:38.609> have<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.939> know<00:02:39.060> eight<00:02:39.209> hundred

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
so we have you know eight hundred

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.479 
so we have you know eight hundred
strains<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.900> our<00:02:39.959> database<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.370> all

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
strains in our database and it's all

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.399 
strains in our database and it's all
crowd-sourced<00:02:42.060> information<00:02:42.659> so<00:02:42.930> somebody

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
crowd-sourced information so somebody

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.649 
crowd-sourced information so somebody
could<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.280> rate<00:02:45.120> or<00:02:45.329> review<00:02:45.450> a

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
could go in and and rate or review a

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.539 
could go in and and rate or review a
strain<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.349> could<00:02:46.530> search<00:02:46.769> by<00:02:47.099> strains

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
strain and you could search by strains

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.460 
strain and you could search by strains
based<00:02:47.939> on<00:02:48.150> effects<00:02:48.629> so<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.840> you're<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> cancer

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
based on effects so if you're a cancer

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.530 
based on effects so if you're a cancer
patient<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.069> you're<00:02:50.700> looking<00:02:50.970> for<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.180> strain

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
patient and you're looking for a strain

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.420 
patient and you're looking for a strain
that<00:02:51.870> increases<00:02:52.560> your<00:02:52.769> appetite<00:02:52.799> and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that increases your appetite and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.190 
that increases your appetite and
suppresses<00:02:53.879> nausea<00:02:54.299> you'd<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.019> able<00:02:55.079> to

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
suppresses nausea you'd be able to

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.629 
suppresses nausea you'd be able to
filter<00:02:55.500> those<00:02:55.739> strains<00:02:56.040> down<00:02:56.310> right<00:02:56.549> and

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
filter those strains down right and

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.099 
filter those strains down right and
we'll<00:02:56.819> give<00:02:56.939> you<00:02:56.969> you<00:02:57.389> know<00:02:57.420> about<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> dozen

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
we'll give you you know about a dozen

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.470 
we'll give you you know about a dozen
strains<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.799> do<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.939> that's<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.269> what

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
strains that do that so that's the what

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.110 
strains that do that so that's the what
and<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.810> where<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.859> them<00:03:02.159> from<00:03:02.459> there<00:03:02.639> it's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and the where is them from there it's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.879 
and the where is them from there it's
all<00:03:03.239> geo-targeted<00:03:03.959> right<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:04.290> it'll<00:03:04.409> tell<00:03:04.709> you

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
all geo-targeted right so it'll tell you

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.490 
all geo-targeted right so it'll tell you
which<00:03:05.579> dispensaries<00:03:06.299> in<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.659> area<00:03:07.079> carry

which dispensaries in that area carry

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.929 
which dispensaries in that area carry
that<00:03:07.680> particular<00:03:08.220> stress<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:08.639> go<00:03:08.849> on
