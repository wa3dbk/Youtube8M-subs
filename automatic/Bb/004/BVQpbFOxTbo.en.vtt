hello<00:00:06.350> I<00:00:06.590> would<00:00:06.830> like<00:00:07.010> to<00:00:07.190> show<00:00:07.399> you<00:00:07.460> my

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
hello I would like to show you my

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.500 
hello I would like to show you my
gravity<00:00:08.660> knife<00:00:08.840> that<00:00:09.380> I've<00:00:09.500> built<00:00:09.650> myself<00:00:10.510> the

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
gravity knife that I've built myself the

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.060 
gravity knife that I've built myself the
reason<00:00:11.809> why<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:11.930> made<00:00:12.200> this<00:00:12.379> is<00:00:12.559> because<00:00:12.889> it

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
reason why I made this is because it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.860 
reason why I made this is because it
slips<00:00:13.309> through<00:00:13.700> a<00:00:13.849> loophole<00:00:14.210> in<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.510> German

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
slips through a loophole in the German

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.740 
slips through a loophole in the German
law<00:00:15.279> this<00:00:16.279> means<00:00:16.520> that<00:00:16.759> a<00:00:16.820> gravity<00:00:17.270> knife<00:00:17.480> is

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
law this means that a gravity knife is

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.660 
law this means that a gravity knife is
legal<00:00:18.170> as<00:00:18.349> long<00:00:18.410> as<00:00:18.680> it's<00:00:18.860> not<00:00:19.040> auto-locking

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
legal as long as it's not auto-locking

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.010 
legal as long as it's not auto-locking
as<00:00:19.880> long<00:00:20.029> as<00:00:20.150> you<00:00:20.270> need<00:00:20.420> to<00:00:20.540> take<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.869> other

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
as long as you need to take the other

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.470 
as long as you need to take the other
hand<00:00:21.289> to<00:00:21.440> knock<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.490> what<00:00:22.670> I've<00:00:22.820> done<00:00:23.000> is<00:00:23.060> I

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
hand to knock so what I've done is I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.109 
hand to knock so what I've done is I
took<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.710> blade<00:00:25.640> from<00:00:25.970> an<00:00:26.949> ak-47<00:00:28.119> Kalashnikov

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
took the blade from an ak-47 Kalashnikov

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.520 
took the blade from an ak-47 Kalashnikov
bayonet<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:31.269> shorten<00:00:32.269> it<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.419> bit<00:00:32.449> and<00:00:33.199> then<00:00:33.260> I

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
bayonet and shorten it a bit and then I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.470 
bayonet and shorten it a bit and then I
put<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.220> in<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:34.550> grip<00:00:34.820> that<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:35.090> made<00:00:35.330> from

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
put it in this grip that I made from

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.250 
put it in this grip that I made from
steel<00:00:36.040> now<00:00:37.040> this<00:00:37.399> does<00:00:37.579> not<00:00:37.610> lock<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.540> there

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
steel now this does not lock so there

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.910 
steel now this does not lock so there
are<00:00:39.380> two<00:00:39.620> new<00:00:40.340> time<00:00:40.550> magnets<00:00:41.200> so<00:00:42.200> one<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.590> in

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
are two new time magnets so one is in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.200 
are two new time magnets so one is in
the<00:00:43.070> locked<00:00:43.670> position

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
the locked position

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.770 
the locked position
and<00:00:44.719> one<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.079> in<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:45.260> open<00:00:45.710> position<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.780> that

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
and one is in the open position and that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.889 
and one is in the open position and that
of<00:00:47.899> course<00:00:47.930> looks<00:00:48.350> like<00:00:48.789> it<00:00:49.789> is<00:00:50.030> locking<00:00:50.539> but

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
of course looks like it is locking but

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.910 
of course looks like it is locking but
it's<00:00:51.020> not<00:00:51.260> really<00:00:51.680> very<00:00:51.980> soft<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:53.500> it's<00:00:54.500> just<00:00:54.800> a

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's not really very soft so it's just a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160 
it's not really very soft so it's just a
little<00:00:55.520> place<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.329> what<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.600> can<00:00:56.750> do<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.020> you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
little place but what you can do is you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.209 
little place but what you can do is you
can<00:00:57.320> tighten<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.550> bolt<00:00:59.539> here<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.140> then<00:01:00.949> it's

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
can tighten this bolt here and then it's

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.130 
can tighten this bolt here and then it's
actually<00:01:01.399> rock-solid<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.660> nothing<00:01:02.960> can

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
actually rock-solid and nothing can

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.870 
actually rock-solid and nothing can
happen<00:01:03.260> very<00:01:03.649> very<00:01:04.250> started<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.330> tough<00:01:06.880> and

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
happen very very started and tough and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.440 
happen very very started and tough and
if<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.149> want<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.450> plug<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:10.299> put<00:01:11.299> it

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
if you want to plug it in just put it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.179 
if you want to plug it in just put it
back<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.200> can<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.500> course<00:01:12.530> also<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
back and you can of course also do this

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.890 
back and you can of course also do this
automatically<00:01:14.799> like<00:01:15.799> this<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:17.450> if<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.600> want

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
automatically like this and if you want

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.550 
automatically like this and if you want
to<00:01:17.990> snap<00:01:18.260> it<00:01:18.409> back<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:18.799> all<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.460> do<00:01:19.580> is<00:01:20.560> like

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
to snap it back in all you do is like

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.690 
to snap it back in all you do is like
this<00:01:23.350> they<00:01:24.350> leox<00:01:24.650> are<00:01:24.799> not<00:01:24.950> normally<00:01:25.520> not

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
this they leox are not normally not

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.630 
this they leox are not normally not
sharp<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.439> I<00:01:27.439> want<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:27.890> knife<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.280> be<00:01:28.369> sharp

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
sharp but I want this knife to be sharp

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.240 
sharp but I want this knife to be sharp
so<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.060> gave<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.450> an<00:01:29.540> ish<00:01:29.720> what's<00:01:30.380> quite<00:01:30.680> work

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
so I gave it an ish what's quite work

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:45.190 
so I gave it an ish what's quite work
but<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.759> very<00:01:32.540> very<00:01:32.689> sharp<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:43.990> did<00:01:44.990> some

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
but it is very very sharp so I did some

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.670 
but it is very very sharp so I did some
more<00:01:45.320> polishing<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:46.150> ordered<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.270> better<00:01:47.680> told

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
more polishing I ordered a better told

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.389 
more polishing I ordered a better told
from<00:01:49.399> eBay<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.140> so<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:51.920> will<00:01:52.130> do<00:01:52.220> some

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
from eBay and so I will do some

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.730 
from eBay and so I will do some
fine-tuning<00:01:52.610> on<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.020> really<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.439> it

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
fine-tuning on this but I really like it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.590 
fine-tuning on this but I really like it
and<00:01:54.829> it's<00:01:55.189> legal<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.520> carry<00:01:56.350> thanks<00:01:57.350> bye<00:01:57.470> bye
