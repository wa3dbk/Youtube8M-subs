00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
I like this series now since this is

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.040 
I like this series now since this is
only<00:06:36.370> season<00:06:36.850> 1<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.090> don't<00:06:37.420> plan<00:06:37.600> on<00:06:37.720> giving<00:06:37.840> it

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
only season 1 I don't plan on giving it

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.380 
only season 1 I don't plan on giving it
a<00:06:38.110> rating<00:06:38.430> probably<00:06:39.430> not<00:06:39.550> for<00:06:39.670> a<00:06:39.730> while<00:06:39.880> you

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
a rating probably not for a while you

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.000 
a rating probably not for a while you
never<00:06:40.600> know<00:06:40.780> what<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.200> next<00:06:41.410> results<00:06:41.800> will<00:06:41.920> be

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
never know what the next results will be

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.950 
never know what the next results will be
for<00:06:42.190> season<00:06:42.430> 2<00:06:42.580> which<00:06:42.970> I<00:06:43.150> actually<00:06:43.390> am<00:06:43.660> looking

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
for season 2 which I actually am looking

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.410 
for season 2 which I actually am looking
forward<00:06:44.170> to<00:06:44.490> so<00:06:45.490> if<00:06:45.820> you<00:06:45.940> have<00:06:46.060> nothing<00:06:46.210> else

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.420 
forward to so if you have nothing else

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.630 
forward to so if you have nothing else
to<00:06:46.540> do<00:06:46.720> and<00:06:47.050> you<00:06:47.470> dare<00:06:47.740> yourself<00:06:47.920> to<00:06:48.280> watch<00:06:48.430> the

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:48.640 
to do and you dare yourself to watch the

to do and you dare yourself to watch the
show<00:06:48.820> and<00:06:48.970> give<00:06:49.120> it<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.240> shot<00:06:49.450> I'd<00:06:50.050> say

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
show and give it a shot I'd say

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.500 
show and give it a shot I'd say
definitely<00:06:50.470> check<00:06:50.890> it<00:06:50.920> out<00:06:51.100> under<00:06:51.400> my<00:06:51.520> risky

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
definitely check it out under my risky

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.890 
definitely check it out under my risky
recommendation<00:06:53.760> but<00:06:54.760> until<00:06:55.000> next<00:06:55.150> time<00:06:55.420> this

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
recommendation but until next time this

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.790 
recommendation but until next time this
is<00:06:56.050> Goldilocks
