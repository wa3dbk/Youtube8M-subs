if<00:02:07.979> that's<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:09.179> ro<00:02:10.050> showing

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
if that's just going to be as ro showing

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.120 
if that's just going to be as ro showing
it<00:02:11.129> off<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.610> best<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.629> then

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it off the best it can be and then

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.460 
it off the best it can be and then
later<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:13.700> changing<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.260> other

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
later on changing it to the other

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.980 
later on changing it to the other
plastic<00:02:15.950> wheels<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.700> no<00:02:17.270> paint<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:19.990> it's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
plastic wheels and no paint but it's

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.230 
plastic wheels and no paint but it's
going<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:22.060> $45<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.420> leader<00:02:23.600> class<00:02:23.900> toy

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
going to be $45 it's a leader class toy

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.050 
going to be $45 it's a leader class toy
so<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.750> quite<00:02:27.350> expensive<00:02:27.830> don't<00:02:28.640> know<00:02:28.850> if

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
so that is quite expensive don't know if

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.540 
so that is quite expensive don't know if
I'm<00:02:29.240> gonna<00:02:29.390> go<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:30.320> not<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.770> might<00:02:31.010> I'm

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
I'm gonna go for that or not I might I'm

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
really don't go for the larger figures i

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.710 
really don't go for the larger figures i
think<00:02:36.500> i<00:02:36.560> have<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.890> two<00:02:37.640> voyagers<00:02:38.360> and

think i have like two voyagers and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.360 
think i have like two voyagers and
that's<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> farthest<00:02:39.410> i've<00:02:39.560> gone<00:02:39.740> up<00:02:40.040> haven't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
that's the farthest i've gone up haven't

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
that's the farthest i've gone up haven't
got<00:02:40.460> any<00:02:40.670> higher<00:02:40.850> than<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:42.020> um<00:02:43.630> 45<00:02:44.630> bucks

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
got any higher than that but um 45 bucks

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.590 
got any higher than that but um 45 bucks
that's<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.230> lot<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.800> but<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.120> not<00:02:47.540> a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's a lot so but it is not a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320 
that's a lot so but it is not a
bad-looking<00:02:48.530> figure<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.550> just<00:02:49.700> not<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.880> big

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
bad-looking figure I'm just not a big

fan of the backpack now to talk about

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.300 
fan of the backpack now to talk about
this<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.480> comparable<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.590> movie<00:02:54.920> design

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
this is comparable to the movie design

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.470 
this is comparable to the movie design
it<00:02:55.700> does<00:02:55.970> kind<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.960> a<00:02:57.880> samurai<00:02:58.880> ish

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
it does kind of have like a samurai ish

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720 
it does kind of have like a samurai ish
look<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.350> know<00:03:00.470> he's<00:03:00.620> got<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:01.010> sword<00:03:01.310> he<00:03:01.610> has

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
look you know he's got the sword he has

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.750 
look you know he's got the sword he has
the<00:03:01.940> shield<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.990> he<00:03:03.230> looks<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.800> bit<00:03:04.010> more<00:03:04.070> slim

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
the shield and he looks a bit more slim

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.390 
the shield and he looks a bit more slim
down<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.480> not<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.020> you<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.710> clunky<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
down and not so you know clunky and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.100 
down and not so you know clunky and
everything<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:11.150> he<00:03:11.510> does<00:03:11.900> have<00:03:12.050> a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
everything so and he does have a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.890 
everything so and he does have a
different<00:03:12.680> face<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.220> mean<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.460> not<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.970> big

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
different face I mean it's not a big

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.020 
different face I mean it's not a big
change<00:03:15.290> but<00:03:15.500> his<00:03:15.950> face<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.340> slightly

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
change but his face is slightly

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.910 
change but his face is slightly
different<00:03:17.540> than<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.200> know<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> first<00:03:18.620> three

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
different than you know the first three

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.740 
different than you know the first three
movies<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.460> mean<00:03:19.640> actually<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:20.360> first<00:03:20.570> leg

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
movies I mean actually in the first leg

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.120 
movies I mean actually in the first leg
movies<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.140> has<00:03:21.290> gone<00:03:21.560> through<00:03:21.830> slight

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
movies it has gone through slight

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.400 
movies it has gone through slight
changes<00:03:22.670> but<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.420> think<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.720> one<00:03:23.960> is<00:03:23.990> the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
changes but I think this one is the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.680 
changes but I think this one is the
biggest<00:03:24.650> slight<00:03:25.220> change<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:26.210> still<00:03:26.420> kind<00:03:26.630> of

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
biggest slight change it still kind of

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.410 
biggest slight change it still kind of
has<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.110> main<00:03:27.350> look<00:03:27.710> and<00:03:27.920> everything<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:29.150> it

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
has the main look and everything but it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.210 
has the main look and everything but it
it<00:03:30.080> does<00:03:30.320> look<00:03:30.350> different<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.980> how<00:03:31.040> to

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
it does look different on how to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.550 
it does look different on how to
describe<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.910> while<00:03:32.090> talking<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.140> has<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
describe it while talking but it has a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.230 
describe it while talking but it has a
different<00:03:34.070> look<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.850> think<00:03:37.850> I'm

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
different look to it and I think I'm

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.360 
different look to it and I think I'm
annoyed<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> CGI<00:03:39.080> design<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:39.770> gonna<00:03:40.130> like

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
annoyed the CGI design I'm gonna like

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.850 
annoyed the CGI design I'm gonna like
the<00:03:40.520> change<00:03:40.880> I'm<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.510> can't<00:03:41.750> wait<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> see<00:03:42.320> what

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
the change I'm I can't wait to see what

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.440 
the change I'm I can't wait to see what
bumblebee<00:03:43.310> looks<00:03:43.550> like<00:03:43.760> because<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:44.030> think

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
bumblebee looks like because you think

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.630 
bumblebee looks like because you think
they'd<00:03:44.630> be<00:03:44.870> showing<00:03:45.290> him<00:03:45.530> soon<00:03:45.890> too<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.370> well

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
they'd be showing him soon too as well

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.300 
they'd be showing him soon too as well
because<00:03:47.540> he's<00:03:47.900> going<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.620> only<00:03:48.830> other

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
because he's going to be the only other

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.699 
because he's going to be the only other
returning<00:03:49.790> character<00:03:50.360> with<00:03:50.570> design<00:03:51.080> changes

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.060 
returning character with design changes
i<00:03:51.770> think<00:03:52.209> which<00:03:53.209> will<00:03:53.420> lead<00:03:53.570> into<00:03:53.830> my<00:03:54.830> next

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
i think which will lead into my next

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.580 
i think which will lead into my next

topic of discussion discussion and that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.230 
topic of discussion discussion and that
is<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:58.040> lead<00:03:58.250> foot<00:03:58.580> in<00:03:59.290> ratchet<00:04:00.850> both<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.120> them

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
rally fighters are different cars so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.870 
rally fighters are different cars so
they're<00:04:21.770> not<00:04:21.859> going<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.160> be<00:04:22.310> doubles<00:04:22.729> or

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
they're not going to be doubles or

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.280 
they're not going to be doubles or
anything<00:04:23.330> they<00:04:23.510> both<00:04:23.810> have<00:04:24.050> different

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290

numbers

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
numbers

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.660 
numbers
them<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.420> they<00:04:26.050> both<00:04:26.200> have<00:04:26.500> some<00:04:26.800> skoal<00:04:27.160> logos

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
them and they both have some skoal logos

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.690 
them and they both have some skoal logos
as<00:04:27.910> well<00:04:28.560> which<00:04:29.560> kind<00:04:30.100> of<00:04:30.160> reminds<00:04:30.430> me<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
as well which kind of reminds me the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.790 
as well which kind of reminds me the
nest<00:04:30.940> logo<00:04:31.450> but<00:04:31.750> they're<00:04:31.960> different<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.650> it's

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
nest logo but they're different so it's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.740 
nest logo but they're different so it's
interesting<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.490> where<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:34.390> would<00:04:34.420> be

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
interesting to see where that would be

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.540 
interesting to see where that would be
taken<00:04:35.230> if<00:04:35.890> that's<00:04:36.100> going<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.280> have<00:04:36.400> any

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
taken if that's going to have any

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.610 
taken if that's going to have any
significance<00:04:37.180> if<00:04:37.330> it's<00:04:37.480> enough<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.870> logo

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
significance if it's enough like a logo

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.470 
significance if it's enough like a logo
for<00:04:38.650> some<00:04:38.980> type<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:39.160> strike<00:04:39.580> team<00:04:39.850> or<00:04:40.210> strike

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
for some type of strike team or strike

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.100 
for some type of strike team or strike
force<00:04:40.810> on<00:04:41.080> something<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.630> but<00:04:43.630> on<00:04:44.050> a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
force on something like that but on a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.350 
force on something like that but on a
topic<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.740> lead<00:04:45.070> foot<00:04:45.370> um<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:46.980> think<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:49.180> he's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
topic of lead foot um I think that he's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.420 
topic of lead foot um I think that he's
going<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.870> be<00:04:50.200> maybe<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:50.920> beginning<00:04:51.040> of

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
going to be maybe in the beginning of

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.690 
going to be maybe in the beginning of
the<00:04:51.550> movie<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.290> for<00:04:53.290> some<00:04:53.470> reason<00:04:53.500> not<00:04:54.040> in<00:04:54.310> the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
the movie and for some reason not in the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.580 
the movie and for some reason not in the
end<00:04:54.910> whether<00:04:55.210> he<00:04:55.450> gets<00:04:55.630> killed<00:04:55.900> off<00:04:56.110> where<00:04:56.500> you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
end whether he gets killed off where you

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.610 
end whether he gets killed off where you
leave<00:04:56.800> something<00:04:57.250> like<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:58.140> but<00:04:59.140> he<00:04:59.320> hasn't

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620
