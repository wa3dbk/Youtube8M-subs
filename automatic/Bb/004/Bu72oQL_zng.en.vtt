has<00:01:31.710> nothing<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.290> Vista<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.350> all

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
has nothing to do with the Vista at all

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
has nothing to do with the Vista at all
this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.159> complete<00:01:35.670> diversion<00:01:36.450> here

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this is just a complete diversion here

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
this is just a complete diversion here
here's<00:01:37.380> another<00:01:37.530> example<00:01:37.650> yeah<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> thought

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
here's another example yeah I thought

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
here's another example yeah I thought
you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.850> maybe<00:01:39.060> scale<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> walls<00:01:39.780> across

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you know maybe scale the walls across

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
you know maybe scale the walls across
nope<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> actual<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:43.020> this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
nope but the actual way to get this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
nope but the actual way to get this
Vista<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.430> keep<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:45.000> keep<00:01:45.240> going

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Vista is to just keep going keep going

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.929 
Vista is to just keep going keep going
all<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.560> into<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> fields<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
all the way out into the fields and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
all the way out into the fields and
you'll<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.960> bunch<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.320> rocks<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> can

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you'll see a bunch of rocks that you can

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.530 
you'll see a bunch of rocks that you can
climb<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.299> it's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
climb up now from here on out it's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780 
climb up now from here on out it's
pretty<00:01:51.750> easy<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.520> know<00:01:53.610> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
pretty easy but I just I don't know it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.950

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.240 
funny they designed a bunch of walls
that<00:02:28.900> look<00:02:29.410> like<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.680> could<00:02:29.800> walk<00:02:30.040> across
