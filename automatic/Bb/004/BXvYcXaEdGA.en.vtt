00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.899 
looking at characters and their powers
and<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.700> fights<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:37.040> seeing<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.700> world

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and the fights I like seeing the world

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.870 
and the fights I like seeing the world
and<00:01:39.600> how<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.290> characters<00:01:40.770> grow<00:01:41.549> over<00:01:41.850> time

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and how the characters grow over time

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.999 
and how the characters grow over time
not<00:01:42.119> only<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.750> terms<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.799> physical

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
not only in terms of the physical

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
not only in terms of the physical
strength<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> their<00:01:44.909> abilities<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.020> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
strength and their abilities but also in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
strength and their abilities but also in
terms<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.100> their<00:01:47.520> relationship<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> world

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
terms of their relationship to the world

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.880 
terms of their relationship to the world
itself<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:50.460> right<00:01:50.610> next<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.909> what<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.570> most

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
itself all right next up what is my most

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
itself all right next up what is my most
unfamiliar<00:01:52.890> jon<00:01:53.100> renau<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.970> that's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
unfamiliar jon renau that that's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
unfamiliar jon renau that that's
probably<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.380> shoujo<00:01:56.040> probably

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
probably going to be a shoujo probably

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.770 
probably going to be a shoujo probably
although<00:01:56.610> i<00:01:56.700> did<00:01:56.909> watch<00:01:57.090> Sailor<00:01:57.390> Moon<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
although i did watch Sailor Moon as a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.920 
although i did watch Sailor Moon as a
kid<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.710> maybe<00:01:59.250> it'd<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.820> slice<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.750> life

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
kid so maybe it'd be slice of life

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
kid so maybe it'd be slice of life
probably<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.490> not

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
probably to something that I'm not

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.510 
probably to something that I'm not
really<00:02:02.700> interested<00:02:02.960> too<00:02:03.960> much<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.649> that's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really interested too much in so that's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.789 
really interested too much in so that's
probably<00:02:05.729> gonna<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.149> most<00:02:06.299> often<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
probably gonna be my most often the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
probably gonna be my most often the
unfamiliar<00:02:07.799> genre<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.119> what's<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.420> thing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
unfamiliar genre so what's one thing

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.029 
unfamiliar genre so what's one thing
that<00:02:09.599> persuades<00:02:10.080> me<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.530> continue<00:02:10.920> watching

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that persuades me to continue watching

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.910 
that persuades me to continue watching
series<00:02:11.400> after<00:02:11.580> episode<00:02:11.940> 1<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.480> good<00:02:13.230> ending

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.800 
now my favorite enemy soundtrack that
one<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.609> pretty<00:03:20.910> hard<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.239> there's<00:03:21.450> so

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
one is pretty hard because there's so

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.680 
one is pretty hard because there's so
many<00:03:21.959> good<00:03:22.200> ones<00:03:22.350> my<00:03:23.250> favorite<00:03:23.280> one<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.180> would

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
many good ones my favorite one I would

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.349 
many good ones my favorite one I would
probably<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.440> be<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:26.070> hunter<00:03:26.670> hunter<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
probably have to be a hunter hunter and

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.370 
probably have to be a hunter hunter and
etude<00:03:29.060> that's<00:03:30.060> probably<00:03:30.269> my<00:03:30.570> favorite<00:03:30.959> once<00:03:31.200> a

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
etude that's probably my favorite once a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.340 
etude that's probably my favorite once a
gone<00:03:31.769> also<00:03:32.040> Fullmetal<00:03:32.489> Alchemist<00:03:33.000> ending<00:03:33.690> to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
gone also Fullmetal Alchemist ending to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.830 
gone also Fullmetal Alchemist ending to
or<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:34.739> believe<00:03:35.040> but<00:03:35.700> those<00:03:36.239> are<00:03:36.390> very<00:03:36.630> similar

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
or I believe but those are very similar

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.509 
or I believe but those are very similar
in<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.049> they<00:03:37.230> start<00:03:37.530> before<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:38.430> episode

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
in that they start before the episode

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.890 
in that they start before the episode
actually<00:03:39.060> ends<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.359> could<00:03:39.510> put<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> couple

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
actually ends I could put a couple

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.180 
actually ends I could put a couple
seconds<00:03:40.290> before<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.620> ends<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.100> get

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
seconds before it ends so that I get

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.009 
seconds before it ends so that I get
that<00:03:41.700> goes<00:03:41.850> into<00:03:42.000> what<00:03:42.239> makes<00:03:42.660> me<00:03:42.780> want<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
that goes into what makes me want to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.020 
that goes into what makes me want to
keep<00:03:43.140> watching<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.650> favorite<00:03:44.459> anime<00:03:44.700> slander

made by yes in the 70s which is a very
popular<00:03:57.930> band<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.519> really<00:03:59.640> that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
popular band so it's not really that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.520 
popular band so it's not really that
much<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.239> an<00:04:00.329> anime<00:04:00.660> song<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.140> its<00:04:01.230> toes<00:04:01.380> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
much of an anime song but its toes I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.099 
much of an anime song but its toes I
mean<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.310> can't<00:04:03.090> stop<00:04:03.269> listening<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.870> is
