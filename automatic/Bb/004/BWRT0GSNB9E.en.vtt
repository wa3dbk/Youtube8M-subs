00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
a whole new way of thinking about high

know the Cray one systems where

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.330 
know the Cray one systems where
Singapore<00:00:14.300> was<00:00:14.540> one<00:00:14.870> of<00:00:15.080> Singapore<00:00:15.620> but<00:00:16.129> a

Singapore was one of Singapore but a

moment right now for that machine you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.630 
moment right now for that machine you
could<00:00:29.960> leave<00:00:30.319> it<00:00:30.439> on<00:00:30.560> your<00:00:30.679> desktop<00:00:31.099> which<00:00:31.489> is

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
could leave it on your desktop which is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.229 
could leave it on your desktop which is
Yuri<00:00:31.849> machines<00:00:32.450> right<00:00:32.720> now<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.460> perhaps<00:00:34.460> cost

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
Yuri machines right now and perhaps cost

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.150 
Yuri machines right now and perhaps cost
couple<00:00:35.539> thousand<00:00:35.840> dollars<00:00:35.870> but<00:00:36.769> what

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
couple thousand dollars but what

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.729 
couple thousand dollars but what
important<00:00:37.730> thing<00:00:37.910> is<00:00:38.149> that<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:38.780> amount<00:00:39.559> of

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
important thing is that the amount of

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.130 
important thing is that the amount of
computational<00:00:40.550> amount<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.329> problems<00:00:41.840> that<00:00:42.019> we

computational amount of problems that we

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.340 
computational amount of problems that we
see<00:00:42.170> that's<00:00:43.100> able<00:00:43.399> to<00:00:43.579> solve<00:00:43.910> by<00:00:44.510> using<00:00:44.870> this

see that's able to solve by using this

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.860 
see that's able to solve by using this

sighs<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.719> be<00:00:56.840> good

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
sighs to be good

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.120 
sighs to be good
and<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.820> think<00:00:59.880> if<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.800> some

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
and I think if you have some

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.340 
and I think if you have some
applications<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.240> very<00:01:03.600> beautiful<00:01:03.840> voice

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
applications that a very beautiful voice

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.680 
applications that a very beautiful voice
you<00:01:04.620> will<00:01:04.830> bite<00:01:06.470> really<00:01:07.470> helpful<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> cloth

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
you will bite really helpful but a cloth

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.860 
you will bite really helpful but a cloth
if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:11.070> using<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.660> night

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
if you are not using it in the night

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.930 
if you are not using it in the night
away<00:01:13.050> maybe<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.460> very<00:01:15.920> difficult<00:01:16.940> to

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
away maybe it's a very very difficult to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.260 
away maybe it's a very very difficult to
program<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:21.290> gpgpu

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.069 

for<00:01:25.899> what<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.829> good<00:01:27.189> things<00:01:27.250> point<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.079> my

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
for what are the good things point to my

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.380 
for what are the good things point to my
experience<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:30.189> if<00:01:30.549> you<00:01:30.850> can<00:01:32.039> really

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
experience is if you can really

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380 
experience is if you can really
understand<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.750> GPT<00:01:35.110> view<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:37.149> will

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
understand the GPT view and you will

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.300 
understand the GPT view and you will
find<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.929> many<00:01:38.710> many<00:01:39.039> different

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
find that many many different

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.569 
find that many many different
applications<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.659> actually<00:01:41.140> doable<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:42.219> it

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
applications is actually doable for it

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.230 
applications is actually doable for it
and<00:01:43.439> maybe<00:01:44.439> you<00:01:44.799> should<00:01:45.100> also<00:01:45.399> change<00:01:45.969> in

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
and maybe you should also change in

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.230 
and maybe you should also change in
development<00:01:47.020> not<00:01:47.439> municipal<00:01:48.429> algorithm<00:01:49.030> for

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
development not municipal algorithm for

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.040 
development not municipal algorithm for
them

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
them

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.230 
them
for<00:01:50.350> new<00:01:50.590> hardware<00:01:51.100> but<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.820> should<00:01:51.880> offer

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
for new hardware but I you should offer

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.640 
for new hardware but I you should offer
new<00:01:53.140> algorithm<00:01:53.920> for<00:01:54.820> all<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.450> them<00:01:55.690> so<00:01:56.260> this<00:01:56.620> is

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
new algorithm for all of them so this is

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.350 
new algorithm for all of them so this is
our<00:01:57.040> peace<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:57.820> working<00:01:58.030> on

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
our peace we are working on

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
our peace we are working on
participating<00:01:59.140> are<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.910> imagine<00:02:00.910> it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
participating are you imagine it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.270 
participating are you imagine it's
almost<00:02:03.130> every<00:02:03.880> stinking<00:02:04.330> tentative

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
almost every stinking tentative

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.950 
almost every stinking tentative
uncomfortable<00:02:06.280> hand<00:02:06.460> over<00:02:06.880> Earth<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.630> from

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
uncomfortable hand over Earth so from

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.580 
uncomfortable hand over Earth so from
the<00:02:08.200> food<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:08.770> need<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.330> objects<00:02:10.930> to<00:02:11.260> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
the food we need to the objects to the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.220 
the food we need to the objects to the
high<00:02:12.480> goals<00:02:13.950> every<00:02:14.950> chemical<00:02:15.730> materials<00:02:16.540> so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
high goals every chemical materials so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.360 
high goals every chemical materials so
this<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.590> very<00:02:17.770> wide<00:02:18.660> area<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:20.380> we<00:02:21.250> are

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this is a very wide area and we are

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.410 
this is a very wide area and we are
always<00:02:21.580> with<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.950> particle<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.400> interval

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
always with this particle the interval

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.500 
always with this particle the interval
really<00:02:27.140> Heather<00:02:27.530> away<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.819> is<00:02:29.060> why<00:02:29.270> we

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
really Heather away so this is why we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.170 
really Heather away so this is why we
can<00:02:29.750> use<00:02:29.930> it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.899 

verification<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.950> real<00:02:34.950> physical<00:02:35.489> system

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
verification of the real physical system

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:46.560 
verification of the real physical system
is<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:38.030> real<00:02:39.030> college<00:02:39.510> system<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.920> i<00:02:41.310> think

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.690 

we<00:02:47.570> can<00:02:47.810> really<00:02:48.020> get<00:02:48.320> very<00:02:48.590> much<00:02:49.160> benefit

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
we can really get very much benefit

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.490 
we can really get very much benefit
fraud<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:51.100> this<00:02:52.100> is<00:02:52.130> my<00:02:52.870> most

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.380 

experience

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.090 

maybe<00:03:02.450> Simon<00:03:03.450> Says<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.080> life<00:03:04.320> sciences<00:03:04.590> a

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
maybe Simon Says in the life sciences a

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.130 
maybe Simon Says in the life sciences a
lot<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.490> data<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.180> need<00:03:09.390> scalable

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
lot of data so so we need scalable

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.080 
lot of data so so we need scalable
solutions<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.770> can<00:03:13.770> stale<00:03:14.100> scale<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
solutions so that can stale scale to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.740 
solutions so that can stale scale to
really<00:03:15.570> really<00:03:16.050> big<00:03:16.260> data<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:18.270> moment

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
really really big data and the moment

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.400 
really really big data and the moment
GPUs<00:03:19.290> are<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.550> fastest<00:03:21.410> fastest

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
GPUs are the fastest fastest

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.080 
GPUs are the fastest fastest
architectures<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:24.290> when<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.410> want<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.740> get

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
architectures so when you want to get

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.720 
architectures so when you want to get
kind<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.240> best<00:03:27.500> performance<00:03:28.500> or<00:03:29.400> some

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
kind of the best performance or some

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.800 
kind of the best performance or some
terms<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.300> price<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.470> power<00:03:31.980> than<00:03:32.630> GPU<00:03:33.630> is

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.880 

then<00:03:36.810> she<00:03:37.290> give<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.740> is<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.850> best<00:03:39.030> choice<00:03:39.890> all

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
then she give you is the best choice all

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.710 
then she give you is the best choice all
right<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.340> what<00:03:41.640> I'm<00:03:41.850> trying<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> say<00:03:42.270> that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
right so what I'm trying to say that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.290 
right so what I'm trying to say that
there<00:03:42.900> are<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.290> lot<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.650> work<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:45.030> and

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
there are a lot of work going on and

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.570 
there are a lot of work going on and
this<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.290> be<00:03:46.440> still<00:03:46.800> more<00:03:47.040> what's<00:03:47.280> going

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
this going to be still more what's going

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.470 
this going to be still more what's going
on<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:49.110> have<00:03:49.290> companies<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.070> nobody<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.300> is

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
on we have companies like nobody and is

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.100 
on we have companies like nobody and is
providing<00:03:51.780> systems<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:53.100> easy<00:03:53.460> to<00:03:53.700> use<00:03:54.110> for

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
providing systems that's easy to use for

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.300 
providing systems that's easy to use for
folks<00:03:55.800> who<00:03:56.040> are<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.760> gb<00:03:57.030> gbu
