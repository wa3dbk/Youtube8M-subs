00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 it was evening and not to say 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.839
 do so was nothing work all the same 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.970
 I found today I wanted to pull out this one 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.980
 what's the philips tape market which even 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 I was born idle in the year 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.750
 somewhere 4 I tried to give it but 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
 regret unsuccessfully because in 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 first such devices now no one 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.890
 needed in the second is not some small 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 malfunctions but today when i have it already 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 shots threshold discovered that mom she 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.170
 might come in handy to listen to the kitchen in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 process 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.510
 quite unpleasant and tedious affairs 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.160
 like washing dishes and cooking 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.829
 so we are on this machine today 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 still a little bit 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.129
 repaired cost it a little 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 firstly broken telescopic 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.030
 antennas and of course show yourself probably 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 I can not because the only thing that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 it remains to be this stub but 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 change it is not a problem but the second thing 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.120
 need to do this clean the regulator 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.129
 volume and input selector 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 here's an example now we will switch to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.270
 radio and add country volume 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 listen to amazing noise 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.530
 In general, the functional seems to be normal 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.820
 cassette even work but here with 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.950
 volume control 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.960
 from the selector there is a certain 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.970
 the problem but that is trite cleaning and 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.490
 so this video comes out on backup 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 channel so we start working with 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 This unit often reproaches me with 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.050
 that I omit many of the details 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.970
 repair equipment that I can tell 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.510
 for example about replacing telescopic 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.460
 antennas 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.780
 I can only state the fact that 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 she was replaced 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 why not on it poked because 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
 there was no such thing in my house 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.240
 she is domestic authentic herself 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.690
 antenna from the TV brackets and Nalchik 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.300
 cap nozzle from receivers in v202 by 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040
 my here is a combination but 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.200
 everything works fine 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.229
 extends the antenna extends rather 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.960
 long and quite provide good reception 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.539
 conditions of the apartment but now we analyze 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.520
 the device and we will deal with switching 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.830
 time and volume control 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.780
 here is the same mode switch and 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.470
 somewhere down there is a regulator 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.690
 loudness 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.820
 Now I have them already smeared but not smeared 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.160
 quite right at all what is called 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.739
 according to science they need to be disassembled 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.750
 clean the contacts separately with a cloth 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.090
 or eraser then this thing is already 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.459
 gently lubricate and collect 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.080
 back and solder honest such 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 operations with such a device are not 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.239
 doing extremely vinyl because i 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.370
 I know that a simpler operation will give 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.950
 no less good result is trite 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.110
 dripping oil inside first 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.290
 dripped a couple of drops of alcohol and then another 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.780
 buried and usually lube here's of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.880
 ordinary medical syringe is not 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.730
 less efficiently and now I think we're in 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.530
 this we can make sure well come 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.510
 time to turn on 7 is not too 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.430
 wonderful device we move 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.010
 telescopic antenna all she already 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.940
 here in place and turn on the unit in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.800
 radio mode there is one add 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.030
 loudness 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.480
 also demonstrated that nothing 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.480
 mind shit 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.330
 an electrician who is very 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.560
 in general, everything in this unit is now 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.640
 it works so small 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.340
 the restoration of the apparatus remains only 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.990
 wash and proudly hoist on the fridge 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.310
 subscribe to the channel rate 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.340
 comment and watch my other videos 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.340
 good luck to all
