00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.420
 and what happens alive today we are in the day 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.160
 25 that day he was trained with a lot 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 of people we had 14 people 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.700
 physically he was fine and had to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 give him hard because there were two days left 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.390
 the breaking terra that my goal was 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.640
 combine the climbs the descents the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.110
 changes of direction and sets so I 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.500
 I put on heat and gave a deal to 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.500
 face time 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.800
 all right 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.330
 to me 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.269
 Let's see 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 Y 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.399
 and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
 and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.000
 later I started to try the campsites 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.610
 do not 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.260
 that I thought they were like a head 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.420
 white who put his head back 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.740
 and it's not like it's not much milk goes like this 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.090
 which is an advice that gave me shelter and 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.770
 kilian and like before learning the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.190
 good technique of the mills so I 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.190
 I put it to it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.189
 then continue to do freestyle 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.140
 just busted from stretching to cable 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.700
 I train super tired but very happy 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.230
 with very good vibes since welcome 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 a few alive from afar and it was a 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.099
 different environment and up to here I 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.269
 I train day 25 so see you tomorrow 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.269
 to take care of yourself voice 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.230
 being encouraged to think
