00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.820
 although the clinical want to send the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.160
 samples to the laboratory has the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.869
 obligation everything must take the 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.029
 high quality samples because 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.340
 misfortune more than 90% of the 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.680
 preparations are full of artifacts 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.500
 or are not valid for diagnosis in 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.770
 this case we see as an extension with 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 excessive force has done has broken 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.850
 all cells and therefore this 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.250
 preparation is not valid for the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.110
 diagnosis these are remnants of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.480
 core chromatin scattered by 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.520
 all preparation this preparation would have 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.879
 than to repeat it because it's not worth it for a 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.309
 diagnostic artifacts by precipitation 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.829
 of the dyes this unfortunately is 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.620
 very typical because they are by before very 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.800
 old ones would have to change depending 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.309
 the cytology that is done every month two 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.380
 months or at least when they start 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.950
 form these precipitates 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.200
 it is here it is more evident that there 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.200
 crystals of staining cans the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.270
 problem will be when there are only about 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 few precipitates that can make us 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.190
 think with blood parasites before the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.960
 It is a good idea to change the boats and 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.230
 Do it again with the dye pot 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.260
 new we will put the preparations the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.920
 part to study down in case it falls 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.560
 dust fall on the part that we're not going to 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.409
 study in such a way that we can 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.710
 clean 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:45.369
 the possible powder that has fallen and so 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.049
 we have a sample without artifacts 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.420
 because unfortunately it is usual 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.829
 find preparations that have 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.619
 neglected and has lots of 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.719
 dust and crap that makes it impossible to 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.789
 cytological study otitis is a 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.560
 multifactorial disease where the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.209
 number of different processes 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 nature are going to give a clinic or 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.409
 similar symptoms therefore 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.440
 for a successful treatment is 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.360
 fundamental to determine the cause for 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.660
 it the cytology of the ear is going to be of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.990
 great utility 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.390
 same as other histological samples 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.670
 we identify the sample we take the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.670
 hyssop for a bit of physiological soil 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.110
 and we will introduce to the bottom of the hole to 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.110
 get the sample 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.629
 and we will make two extensions one for each 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.630
 idol and or right on the right side 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.319
 left 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.549
 on the left side of the object holder 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.609
 clinicians it is enough to see the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.159
 color of the exudate but brings much more 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:58.560
 obviously the study 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:02.280
 cytological because that way we avoid mistakes 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.990
 first remove it without having to see if 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 there are other entities 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.690
 it is clear that it is more frequent in cats 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.800
 in dogs 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.890
 if adults are not seen 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.260
 we can see the presence of their eggs 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330
 once seen the existence or not of another 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.490
 vector we will go to dry and fix the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.670
 sample to dye the same as in 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.770
 stool it is convenient to use another set of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.030
 stain to prevent us from 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.030
 littering extinction 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.390
 in this case of otitis 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.040
 station so slow in this ear 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 but it's going to be the cytology that we 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.650
 determine the type of bacteria and if that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.630
 mixed infection or not here we see great 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.840
 amount of bacteria you have to have in 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.920
 realize that it's like there are bacteria started 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.540
 lists see a few bacteria by 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.050
 because when there is a lot of 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.330
 bacteria we are facing otitis 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.520
 bacterial is more indicative see the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.950
 presence of these phagocytized bacteria 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.970
 by neutrophils 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.690
 here we see an otitis coconut list 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.580
 our presence of bacilli and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.280
 dangerous are the short bacilli that 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.230
 are the grains that are more resistant to 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.770
 antibiotics should therefore 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.430
 make a crop the presence of 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.130
 macrophages 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.340
 is indicating the chronicity of the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.070
 process the bacterial athletes will be 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.760
 when we see more than 25 bacteria per 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:09.910
 field of 40 increases and in this case the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.040
 bacteria will not confuse them with 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.440
 cytoplasmic bodies as we see in 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.240
 this image that are of significance 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.720
 unknown but totally pathogenic 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.970
 in the next image we see the two 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.400
 structures to be able to compare them and not 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.680
 confuse the if in the cell below 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.380
 the cytoplasmic bodies and in the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.810
 superior the large amount of bacteria 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.790
 that would be an otitis by bacteria 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.940
 formed lactic is already this yeast 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.420
 with typical shape of peanuts or sole 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.850
 of shoe gives a brown exudate towards 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.280
 dark that if the clinician just fix 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.680
 the exodus can be confused to give an error 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.080
 diagnosis by mites as they are 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.660
 diners are diagnosed when there 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.270
 More than 10 malaysia per field of 44 x 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.150
 say increases here we see the bad is 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.130
 jazz with a lot of flakes by 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.830
 the background of the preparation are more 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.420
 pathogens this yeast combination 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.190
 with bacteria here for having another type 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.500
 of fungal infection in the ear but 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.510
 it is less frequent that the more is already in 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.070
 this case we see a lot of 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.320
 epithelial cells that are going to 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.750
 indicate that we are facing an alteration 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.930
 of lipids of the skin diseases 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.090
 inflammatory or allergic any 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.560
 increase in lymph nodes 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.470
 justifies the cytological study of this 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.420
 so we can do it to diagnose 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.880
 infectious skin diseases 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.700
 allergic diseases and especially 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.260
 tumors the metastases of the tumors 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:43.050
 you have to keep in mind that many 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.050
 tumors can put state in jumps
