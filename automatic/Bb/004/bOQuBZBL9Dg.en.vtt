00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 blend that is your dashboard 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.160
 blackberry in this case passport where 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 on android ios tablet but also on pc mac 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.960
 or windows needle is used for many things 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.839
 I think the manager you forget in 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 office the blackberry and must send one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.340
 fundamental mail from the properties of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 staff on which he cannot configure the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.840
 own company account or you are a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 bed you're on the couch 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 you want to send a message you want 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.670
 access our files to photos you have 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 done with the good you have forgotten 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 to blend all this well with a blend 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.940
 it is possible multiplatform did 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.020
 really very pertinent we have 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020
 find out how it works together 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.920
 yes yes to the recco which application 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.470
 practice of all the theory we have 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.140
 explained in the presentation you see 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.210
 here the short pass here an ipad but 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.129
 the application is already available 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.379
 for android tablet 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.119
 when he had application he asks me with 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.860
 which device you want to establish 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.159
 connection remember connection 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.009
 safe with all blackberry securities 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.740
 with the encryption algorithms you see 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.070
 here on the blackberry it appears to me that to the pads 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.780
 was connected via wifi and here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.250
 what about the apple app but equal 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.910
 even we'll find it on android on pc and su 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.009
 mac for pc all the dashboard 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.810
 which allows you to check that 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.190
 what's happening on my pasture 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.580
 you just see a me on the pass 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.090
 live court or notification and it appears to me 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.220
 also on the blend dashboard I can 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.020
 go to check lab then all the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.590
 messaging I'm getting on mine 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.560
 on my blackberry sky here on the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.930
 tablet I can go back to the home page 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.700
 i can check bbm sms read them but 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.590
 not only can they also write them I can 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.189
 go to view the calendar 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.350
 I can go to view the contacts 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.679
 contacts that are obviously contacts 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 of the blackberry I can go to see the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.090
 file that I have inside my passport 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.890
 however to all the devices that 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.820
 they will support bland and they are all those 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 with 10.31 for example in the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.600
 camera see all images 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.519
 can open them I can view them 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 I can copy them up to ipad 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.410
 for example, music can even 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 double click to play 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.280
 from ipad 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.670
 the music I have on the blackberry in 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.190
 so you have if you want a a 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.470
 double of the music now not 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.750
 is starting ok per game heard here 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.850
 there is also a little bit also because the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.519
 passport is currently connected 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.620
 under 3g network it seems to me not under the net 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.690
 wifi not actually under wifi network but the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 beauty of this system is that I can 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.180
 have ideas 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.740
 weiss connected on networks completely 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.540
 different so I can have also 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.640
 forgotten backberry in the office and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.990
 despite this I could go to 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.510
 view what is coming 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.750
 on the blackberry as a text message 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.750
 write from blackberry in remotely 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.610
 in short, so many possibilities for a 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.990
 program that is very interesting 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.580
 would be according to me is also implemented 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.040
 with voice calls not so much for 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
 call from the ipad but to see if for 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.020
 example I get calls 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.770
 notifications etc. etc. etc. 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.900
 an application that is also declined 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.480
 in desktop version and let's see 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.310
 how it works on su mac 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.050
 and here is the desktop version in this 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.090
 case is turning on me but there is also the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.590
 windows version you see we have the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.440
 same functions that we find in the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.650
 version for where I'm trying to send 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.350
 to my blackberry passport a text message 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.630
 you have seen notification and I see it in 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.030
 top right I can click on it I see 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.630
 all messages can be answered 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.850
 quietly from the PC keyboard in 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.370
 very very fast way of course 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.739
 we see text messages 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.200
 let's see you, in short, everything comes 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.390
 also reproduced on this application 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.390
 here in the top left how many sms how many 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.180
 months and how many bpm we have not read 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.510
 the calendar we see here in Basque 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.700
 to also display appointments 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.820
 daily those weekly ones 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.560
 monthly and the interesting thing is the file 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.240
 manager because I can go and see 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.300
 all the elements I have inside 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.140
 in my blackberry even here with the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.650
 double click 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.030
 I open the do now I opened in 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.790
 Mamma mia what an ugly face I opened it 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.210
 in preview from here I can save the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.940
 file I can also safely go 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.680
 to add a file to the folders 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.580
 or on PC see if with a simple drag 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.560
 and drag and drop for example music 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.290
 I can open moondance I can click 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.760
 twice have it start on the pc you have 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.980
 since beautiful notifications the born 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
 among these are the various possibilities 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.910
 possibility to also block the area of 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.410
 in short, I work under a password 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.760
 so many possibilities to come 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.920
 implemented in my opinion in the future 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.620
 also with the appropriate to see also from 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:16.750
 desktop client calls incoming calls 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.490
 on our password but back for the 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.900
 final conclusions that have seen how 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.770
 works on right belonged to the 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.090
 same way compared to the tablet 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.720
 what this application can do 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.390
 well i think of the manager kyle blackberry from 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.960
 job and a personal ipad does not want 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.490
 install your mail does not want 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.470
 configure your mail to your own 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.100
 contacts on your personal tablet 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.620
 however he can still work from the sofa 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.190
 from the bed with a blend on its own 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.490
 blackberry 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.770
 maybe I'll take blackberry in office in 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.090
 stay or really want first 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.830
 maybe one forgets the blackberry 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.590
 in short, applications 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.800
 I think there are so many for 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.690
 this system that I don't hesitate and don't have 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.460
 hesitated to define a genius for 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.460
