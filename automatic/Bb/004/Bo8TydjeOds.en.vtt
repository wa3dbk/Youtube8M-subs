00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello welcome everyone to the channel 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.919
 leopard with you alexander today with me 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 on repair 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:15.929
 99 VAZ 2101 Osta 9 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.060
 the problem is that it periodically 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.380
 own desire disappear completely 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 all power machines 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.699
 strange such never such yet 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.460
 was but here three days ago began 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.579
 man such trouble stalled by itself 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.770
 car stalled at the traffic lights and not 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.649
 start up and nothing to burn is not the device 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 no turning nothing works like that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.020
 interesting topic of the post and it will turn out 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.800
 an hour later to start up and go such 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.690
 interesting parsley we of course 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.760
 rummaged a little bit in general, then found 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 the reason that it does not work disassembled 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.000
 of course a lot of things in general came to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.470
 I conclude that the ignition lock is not at all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 give in power accordingly and after 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 we did not work the ignition or 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:24.480
 ignition system and everything else is not 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:35.040
 working now show 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:36.870
 one where did we find our parables we already 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.220
 eliminated there now I will show that we 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.620
 It was made here these wires connector 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.400
 go the ignition lock directly here 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:56.040
 our develop this connector goes straight to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:02.760
 ignition lock and now we have at 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:06.060
 brown wire here it is 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.950
 the wire is brown and here it is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.890
 there must be constant nutrition here's how 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.410
 Now she is now because we already 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.840
 twisted the wires found the open and twisted 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.120
 true and now there is food and before that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.480
 we found that we do not come 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.460
 constant plus and she is our castle 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.370
 ignition 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 now he comes on the brown wire 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.500
 thick brown power wire that's not 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 it was a plus and not the car was completely dying 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 there was nothing worked the machine did not 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.250
 turning down stomping nothing 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:50.120
 respectively this connector and wires from 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:53.550
 him go to our fuse box 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.590
 which is under the hood under we 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.770
 Now let's go under the hood 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:07.340
 dress now we spend under the hood and I 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.340
 I'll show you where we would have 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.060
 away and so clipping us was very 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.360
 banal that brown wire which 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:29.040
 hooked to the connector it comes in to our 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.480
 fuse box and out of it 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.390
 goes to the connector on the ignition so 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:46.730
 here we were not plus she locks ignition 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:50.310
 we did not have a plus before more precisely after 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.320
 fuse block was not a plus in front 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.810
 fuse block, too, we did not have 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.700
 power on the incoming and what is the main 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.130
 the incoming fuse box 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.770
 that feed our ignition 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.220
 This is the main power wire that goes 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:09.480
 from the generator from the generator comes in 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.720
 fuse box through a network of connectors 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.820
 switches to the ignition lock 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.250
 so we decided that we do not have 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:24.080
 food does not come catering not even 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:27.690
 on the fuse box respectively 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.910
 made a measurement on the generator she 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.330
 generators are also no permanent 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.330
 plus and here is the brown wire on 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.200
 generators and it was not a plus and this 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.090
 brown wire is screwed under 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.730
 Gadget in it is still screwed two 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.490
 there were no pink wires on it 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.850
 plus such is found my 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.840
 reasons, and this brown wire is 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.620
 here he he he comes from the terminals directly 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.070
 main power 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.370
 electricians all over the car he goes 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.950
 from 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.640
 our car plus terminals 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:09.960
 the generator and it turned out that we 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:13.050
 the cliff was a little bit shook 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.810
 so that nothing short-circuits our cliff 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.720
 there was this brown wire 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.990
 which goes from the battery terminals to 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.990
 generator is the main power of the whole 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.900
 car systems or electrics 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.540
 here we found a cliff here coiled up now 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.000
 well for isolating you can solder this 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:37.010
 this twist our 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.740
 and by this method we discovered our 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.840
 malfunction eliminated here such 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.930
 the reason why the car is completely glohla 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:53.060
 not from that not all here the cliff was exactly 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:56.070
 in this here is the wire such is the reason all 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.920
 just fiddled a little bit 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.470
 of course a little and nothing torpedo 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.850
 complex 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.680
 can someone come in handy male then 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.890
 too such trouble will be thanks that 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.040
 watched subscribe everyone good luck to 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.040
 dating
