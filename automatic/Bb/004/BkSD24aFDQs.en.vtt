00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.560 
mix because this shade is actually
closer<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:31.150> my<00:02:31.330> original<00:02:31.840> lip<00:02:32.800> color<00:02:33.160> then<00:02:34.120> my

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
natural lip color then the paint means

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.190 
natural lip color then the paint means
too<00:02:36.400> because<00:02:36.610> pink<00:02:36.820> mix<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.210> actually<00:02:37.570> lighter

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
too because pink mix is actually lighter

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.870 
to mention the longevity of this
lipstick<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.150> like<00:05:44.960> all<00:05:45.740> three<00:05:46.040> lipsticks<00:05:46.520> the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
lipstick so like all three lipsticks the

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.940 
lipstick so like all three lipsticks the
typical<00:05:47.330> lipsticks<00:05:47.900> that<00:05:47.990> they<00:05:48.350> stay<00:05:48.560> on<00:05:48.590> for

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
typical lipsticks that they stay on for

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.970 
typical lipsticks that they stay on for
about<00:05:49.070> four<00:05:49.850> hours<00:05:49.910> on<00:05:50.450> your<00:05:50.600> lips<00:05:50.900> but<00:05:51.740> that

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
about four hours on your lips but that

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.040 
about four hours on your lips but that
is<00:05:52.160> if<00:05:52.430> you're<00:05:52.670> not<00:05:52.700> eating<00:05:53.180> or<00:05:53.570> if<00:05:53.720> you're<00:05:53.870> not

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
is if you're not eating or if you're not

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.370 
is if you're not eating or if you're not
drinking<00:05:54.230> but<00:05:55.040> I<00:05:55.370> think<00:05:55.700> that<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.570> longevity

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
drinking but I think that the longevity

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.740 
drinking but I think that the longevity
is<00:05:57.800> pretty<00:05:58.100> commendable<00:05:58.670> as<00:05:58.850> well<00:05:59.210> because

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
is pretty commendable as well because

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.250 
is pretty commendable as well because
they<00:05:59.960> don't<00:06:00.320> fade<00:06:01.100> out<00:06:01.250> that<00:06:01.490> easily<00:06:02.260> unless

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
they don't fade out that easily unless

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.960 
they don't fade out that easily unless
you<00:06:03.470> keep<00:06:03.680> on<00:06:03.830> licking<00:06:04.100> your<00:06:04.220> lips<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.700> course
