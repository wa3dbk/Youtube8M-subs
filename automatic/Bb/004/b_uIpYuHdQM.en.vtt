that's about the length that you are
shooting<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.149> class<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
shooting for in this class you can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
shooting for in this class you can
instead<00:00:37.680> start<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.250> new<00:00:38.370> novel<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:39.300> plan

instead start a new novel and just plan

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.910 
instead start a new novel and just plan
that<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.020> keep<00:00:40.140> going<00:00:40.469> after<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that you would keep going after the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
that you would keep going after the
class<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.520> pretty<00:00:41.790> cool<00:00:42.000> too<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
class that's pretty cool too because it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.819 
class that's pretty cool too because it
will<00:00:42.780> force<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> keep<00:00:43.440> writing

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
will force you to keep writing

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.389 
will force you to keep writing
hopefully<00:00:44.520> theoretically<00:00:45.420> perhaps<00:00:46.250> but<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.309> do

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
hopefully theoretically perhaps but I do

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.860 
hopefully theoretically perhaps but I do
want<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> start<00:00:48.149> something<00:00:48.480> new<00:00:48.510> rather

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
want you to start something new rather

than something you've been working on

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
than something you've been working on
one<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> reasons<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.539> lot<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
one of the reasons for this is a lot of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.540 
one of the reasons for this is a lot of
a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> writers<00:00:53.940> who<00:00:54.110> want<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> become<00:00:55.550> pros

get stuck in a rut of working on the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
get stuck in a rut of working on the
same<00:00:59.430> concept<00:01:00.359> over<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.020> over<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.469> over

genres<00:05:10.400> do<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:11.060> idea<00:05:11.419> for<00:05:11.630> us<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
genres do the idea for us is that the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.440 
genres do the idea for us is that the
setting<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:12.950> living<00:05:13.460> breathing<00:05:13.730> character

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
setting is a living breathing character

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.300 
setting is a living breathing character
and<00:05:14.630> we<00:05:15.080> I<00:05:15.110> include<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.740> lot<00:05:15.950> of<00:05:16.070> different

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
and we I include a lot of different

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.920 
and we I include a lot of different
things<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:16.640> this<00:05:16.790> end<00:05:17.030> this<00:05:17.180> idea<00:05:17.510> for<00:05:17.690> setting

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
things in this end this idea for setting

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.210 
things in this end this idea for setting
it's<00:05:18.050> all<00:05:18.200> of<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.440> sort<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.770> science<00:05:19.100> fiction

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
it's all of the sort of science fiction

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.270 
it's all of the sort of science fiction
and<00:05:19.430> fantasy<00:05:19.520> stuff<00:05:20.480> I<00:05:20.750> don't<00:05:21.560> start<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.160> book

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
and fantasy stuff I don't start a book

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.500 
and fantasy stuff I don't start a book
until<00:05:22.550> I've<00:05:22.640> got<00:05:22.790> a<00:05:22.820> couple<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.300> good<00:05:23.450> ideas

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
until I've got a couple of good ideas

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.740 
until I've got a couple of good ideas
for<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.410> setting<00:05:24.800> all<00:05:25.220> right

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
for a setting all right

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.870 
for a setting all right
you<00:05:27.200> combine<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.560> with<00:05:27.770> a<00:05:27.980> character<00:05:29.200> um<00:05:30.880> I

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
you combine that with a character um I

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.300 
you combine that with a character um I
usually<00:05:32.780> want<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.200> start<00:05:33.500> with<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:33.710> good<00:05:34.130> idea

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
usually want to start with a good idea

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.100 
usually want to start with a good idea
for<00:05:34.669> character<00:05:35.000> an<00:05:35.090> idea<00:05:35.360> for<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.570> character<00:05:35.780> is

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
for character an idea for a character is

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.850 
for character an idea for a character is
really<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> character<00:05:36.650> conflict<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:39.470> right<00:05:39.680> a

good<00:05:40.490> character<00:05:41.060> conflict<00:05:42.040> then<00:05:43.040> you<00:05:43.520> mix

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
good character conflict then you mix

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.630 
good character conflict then you mix
that<00:05:44.030> with<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.360> plot<00:05:44.660> idea<00:05:47.620> plot<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.860> generally

it<00:06:18.590> is<00:06:18.680> but<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:18.950> can't<00:06:19.250> have<00:06:19.460> an<00:06:19.669> interesting

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
it is but you can't have an interesting

it is but you can't have an interesting

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.200 
idea for your twist on an interesting
plot<00:06:23.030> okay<00:06:23.810> and<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:24.860> I<00:06:25.070> usually<00:06:25.580> start<00:06:25.760> when<00:06:26.120> to

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
plot okay and so I usually start when to

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.969 
plot okay and so I usually start when to
have<00:06:26.300> it<00:06:26.419> when<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:26.900> have<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.110> few<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.620> each<00:06:27.740> of

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:27.979 
have it when I have a few of each of

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.070 
have it when I have a few of each of
these<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.400> they<00:06:28.940> begin<00:06:29.240> combining<00:06:29.960> in

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
these and they begin combining in

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.140 
these and they begin combining in
interesting<00:06:30.590> ways<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:31.070> that<00:06:31.550> makes<00:06:31.790> me<00:06:31.970> want

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
interesting ways and that makes me want

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.780 
interesting ways and that makes me want
to<00:06:32.210> write<00:06:32.330> a<00:06:32.390> story
