00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 this video let's see how we can 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.850
 cool very quickly 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.970
 cans that are at temperature 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.050
 environment then a video absolutely 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.820
 we are taking these artists today 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
 that are found at room temperature 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 so probably they are around 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.490
 35 37 degrees and we're going to put them in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.609
 cold water with plenty of water we give 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.199
 so let's take a can of beer 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's go in a red bull can that is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 located at room temperature 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.930
 we put in abundant water 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 ice and we are going to pour 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.570
 abundant examination this requires nothing if 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.090
 yes what is the reason to stay 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.079
 it works but i don't think i write i say either 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 fundamentally linked to the fact that it is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.640
 lowers the freezing point of the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 school between the missions in the comments that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.860
 is that he knows it increases it as a solution a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.559
 this point not just two minutes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 we 're going to shoot like that for two minutes 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.820
 our lukewarm will become cold 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.659
 as just presented here we continue to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.000
 turn for two minutes and grace 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 to the magic ingredient that is between 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 plenty of salt put together with water 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.490
 the cold will move to the wedding 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.670
 we have to turn around see you after two 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670
 minutes 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.119
 well only passed only two minutes 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.700
 let's test this experiment 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:42.729
 from the cinquina it is absolutely fresh 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:46.770
 only two months we go there to feel it 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 already in the morning really very cool and 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.450
 really successful final experiment 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.840
 fresh as if pulled out of a fridge 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.810
 very cold in just two minutes 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.329
 so do your stocks 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.979
 ice freezing it inside the 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.840
 paper cups so you have big ones 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.390
 cubes takes any time 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.420
 even a surprise even to a big one 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.890
 number of friends give me a party you will be 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.379
 able to serve soft drinks 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.060
 absolutely prey 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.160
 I don't know what the principle of this is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 miraculous reaction he succeeds in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.790
 freeze it on only two minutes of rivello 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.560
 only two minutes 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.790
 if you succeed with some research in 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.720
 internet to find an explanation 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.310
 scientific 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 write it on the committees 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 ends
