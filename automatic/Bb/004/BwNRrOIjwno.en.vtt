00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.460
 This is the first of these 15 days 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.550
 here the shame peace will become today 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 also represent the dinner 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.290
 the rest we have a little bit more 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.290
 cancel 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.009
 outside and now come the new 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.469
 experiment for this year and indeed 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.929
 tree trunks straw bales like there well 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.899
 Personally, however, it is suitable for me personally 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.630
 until now so elaborate and therefore have 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:29.530
 me on the internet a few videos 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.380
 looked over and over correctly 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.390
 coffee set this is from italian 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.859
 directly from the espresso machine 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.209
 that is from us there I will paper 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:45.129
 from freeman, there a bit 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.500
 I am going to get that rich in humus 

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:52.439
 to mix with each other 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.590
 the whole thing will patches with this goal 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 as one says in German, the vaccine and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.340
 everything comes together in there 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.170
 plastic bag and then becomes airtight 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
 closed and hung in the cellar 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.290
 when I'm ready I sign 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.739
 resists to the patch with 10 here 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.549
 on the statement before it brings 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.730
 five minutes in cold tap water 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:28.349
 improve 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:28.349
 I'll do that in half 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.980
 a glass 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.000
 ok and the rest comes back in the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.020
 packaging so so I have now 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.130
 made a bag ready 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:09.320
 That should be about seven and a half 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.200
 kilo or in volume that corresponds 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.630
 about one and a half kilometer 1 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.960
 that's half and half coffee set now 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:31.090
 and earth moist earth and in the stick 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:31.090
 I now this mushroom mycelium middle one 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.849
 1 gates 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.340
 so we find that together and then 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.800
 We hang in the basement on 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.630
 about 12 to 10 to 15 degrees gets up 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.070
 the packing I have about 12 degrees 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.760
 in the one cellar 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.040
 there is an ideal and there the coffee grounds 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.760
 faster than I thought 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.150
 I will experiment the second time though 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.010
 with wrapped stream equal 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.770
 more on that I said at first though 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.930
 straw is too complicated but me 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.530
 Just try it after the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.220
 Instructions on the instructions for use, however 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.860
 just different and want to tick this 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.140
 sits pretty compressed there 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.340
 put in two pieces that now 24 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.870
 mend hours 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.130
 that means I throw those in here 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.930
 rain barrel complains with a stone 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:58.380
 by tomorrow you will be with the mushroom 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:02.100
 myzel vaccinated and then I will be off and 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.640
 to report how is with the mushrooms 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.260
 is synonymous and sometimes something out of it 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.260
 ok to 10 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.910
 the henry munich here from morning 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.960
 creation is or 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:28.110
 mushrooms first harvest madness a whole 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.300
 kilo 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:39.930
 I'm totally happy and now there's 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.930
 way too lax and macaroni look
