00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.589
 another video of me i am your app 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.569
 I would like to store with you today 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 together the ipod touch the sixth 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 unpacking the generation I have the whole thing 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 in gold ordered with 16 gb the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.849
 packaging has great and aim them 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.470
 honestly hardly changed than on the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 left on the right time is ipod 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 touch behind our gigabyte variant 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.840
 and raised the apple logo otherwise 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 can now also this sticker 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.340
 remove and open the box then comes 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 here directly contrary to ipod touch 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.060
 and I have to say that gold looks up 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 in any case very very nice even 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.079
 a little better than on the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.239
 images and now it all depends on from 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.070
 free the foil then comes one here 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.290
 Directly already the 4 inch list 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 contrary to the ipod touch has it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.399
 now hardly from the design technical 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 it changed only a few colors to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.370
 come and the hardware has been around 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.899
 much improved 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.670
 otherwise we can do it for a short time 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.050
 put aside and give us a little more detail 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 look what else in the scope of delivery 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.620
 is included here then we have to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.360
 First of all all the paperwork and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 we have the apple sticker here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 Of course, also an icon cable with what 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 then I can charge the ipod touch 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 sync on the pc and so on and on 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.740
 then the airports here 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.119
 unfortunately without a microphone otherwise can 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.979
 we now also have the ipod touch 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.260
 start and us as long as the hardware 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.780
 have a closer look so have it below 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.850
 35 jack nike in connection and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.950
 our speaker on the left side 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 then of course our volume regulator above 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 is the power button on the right 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 There is nothing on the page and on the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.650
 back then we have the 8 megapixels 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.770
 camera a microphone led lightning the wlan 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.540
 antenna and the ipod imprint otherwise 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.220
 is now on the back of this button 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.439
 where usually the ipod touch the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 fifth generation of lukom it 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.680
 So this feature will disappear 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.479
 no longer supported here though 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.170
 with a much better one for here 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 hardware so in the middle of an a8 chip with 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.299
 64 bit and one m 8 motion co processor 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.939
 that is, in terms of performance 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 it comes almost to the iphone sex ran 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.219
 but who with very wide content a 4 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 inch display with a resolution of 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:06.329
 1,100 36 x 640 pixels at one 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.099
 pixel density of 326 ppi 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.780
 So I would have here in any case 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 also desired in larger screen 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.760
 and another point I pretty much 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.650
 what a shame 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.239
 found that apple is the ipod touch of the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.939
 sixth generation unfortunately no 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.530
 Touch function has built in and yes 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.540
 otherwise I was already saying too 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.579
 unboxing from the ipod touch the sixth 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.019
 generation you can your opinion to the 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.819
 all the way down in the comments post 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.110
 and if you have any video 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.340
 should wish it could also 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.110
 like to write below in the comments 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.480
 I like to have more videos 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.769
 otherwise, if the ipod touch 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.659
 you liked the video that up 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.579
 definitely a positive assessment is 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.019
 if you also have an ipod touch sixth 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.310
 want to buy generation looks 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.230
 below in the video description i 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.819
 I think the whole and then I would 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.859
 thank you for looking 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.000
 of the video until next time you 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.000
 see my friends
