00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.999 
and it can also fit side-by-side three
both<00:01:35.579> pans<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> full<00:01:37.590> batch<00:01:37.799> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
both pans so you can do a full batch of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
both pans so you can do a full batch of
bread<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> cook<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.210> inside

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bread and cook it right in there inside

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.910 
bread and cook it right in there inside
and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:41.130> cool<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.970> runs<00:01:42.329> off<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.920> tea

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and the cool thing is it runs off of tea

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.440 
and the cool thing is it runs off of tea
lights<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.610> you'll<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> tell<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.360> how

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
lights so you'll have to tell me how

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.789 
lights so you'll have to tell me how
that<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.750> works<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.290> still<00:01:46.560> finding

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that all works because I'm still finding

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
that all works because I'm still finding
that<00:01:47.490> hard<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> believe<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.659> use

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that hard to believe so you just use

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
that hard to believe so you just use
these<00:01:49.049> little<00:01:49.290> tea<00:01:49.470> lights<00:01:49.710> which<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.250> cook

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
these little tea lights which can cook

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
these little tea lights which can cook
for<00:01:51.180> four<00:01:51.509> hours<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.590> four<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
for four hours that right and four to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
for four hours that right and four to
five<00:01:52.979> hours<00:01:53.280> four<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> five<00:01:53.820> hours<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:55.140> with

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
five hours four to five hours just with

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.459 
five hours four to five hours just with
that<00:01:55.560> cooking<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.820> 350<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:57.600> fantastic<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that cooking at 350 that's fantastic to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
that cooking at 350 that's fantastic to
me<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.799> let's<00:01:59.310> tell<00:02:00.149> me<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.420> works<00:02:00.570> I'm

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
me so let's tell me how it works I'm

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.719 
me so let's tell me how it works I'm
really<00:02:01.049> excited<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.430> tea<00:02:02.579> light

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
really excited about it so the tea light

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.389 
really excited about it so the tea light
candles<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.420> paraffin<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.619> has<00:02:05.100> twice

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
candles are paraffin actually has twice

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.540 
candles are paraffin actually has twice
the<00:02:05.460> story<00:02:05.880> energy<00:02:06.420> alcohol<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.190> everyone's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the story energy alcohol and everyone's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.119 
the story energy alcohol and everyone's
heard<00:02:08.700> about<00:02:08.759> an<00:02:09.000> alcohol<00:02:09.300> stove<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.920> can

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
heard about an alcohol stove so we can

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.600 
heard about an alcohol stove so we can
burn<00:02:11.280> half<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> amount<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> fuel

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
burn half the amount of fuel

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.550 
burn half the amount of fuel
and<00:02:12.700> get<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.270> same<00:02:13.510> amount<00:02:13.840> release<00:02:14.290> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and get the same amount release of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.730 
and get the same amount release of
thermal<00:02:14.950> energy<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.150> paraffin<00:02:16.740> with

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
thermal energy with the paraffin with

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.390 
thermal energy with the paraffin with
the<00:02:17.920> XXL<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:19.570> bakes<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.710> your<00:02:20.860> conventional

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the XXL it bakes like your conventional

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.540 
the XXL it bakes like your conventional
oven<00:02:21.520> may<00:02:22.450> uses<00:02:22.840> 20<00:02:23.230> candles<00:02:23.740> but<00:02:23.980> really<00:02:24.340> what

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
oven may uses 20 candles but really what

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.150 
oven may uses 20 candles but really what
we're<00:02:24.790> not<00:02:24.910> using<00:02:25.120> his<00:02:25.360> 20<00:02:25.690> candles<00:02:26.110> reason<00:02:26.800> 20

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
we're not using his 20 candles reason 20

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.190 
we're not using his 20 candles reason 20
wicks<00:02:27.450> because<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.690> wick<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.020> what

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
wicks because the wick is what

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920 
wicks because the wick is what

determines the rate that the fuels is
burnt<00:02:32.350> or<00:02:33.060> combust<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.750> that

burnt or combust and it's that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.450 
burnt or combust and it's that
combustion<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.530> releases<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> thermal

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
combustion that releases the thermal

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
energy which cooks your stuff the reason

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.000 
energy which cooks your stuff the reason
why<00:02:39.190> they<00:02:39.340> eco<00:02:39.730> uses<00:02:40.600> or<00:02:41.260> cooks<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:41.800> like<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
why they eco uses or cooks more like a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.190 
why they eco uses or cooks more like a
crock<00:02:42.310> pot<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.820> because<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> only<00:02:43.510> uses<00:02:43.750> ten

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
crock pot is because it only uses ten

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.700 
crock pot is because it only uses ten
wicks<00:02:44.530> or<00:02:44.890> ten<00:02:45.070> candles<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:47.290> about

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
wicks or ten candles so but what about

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.160 
wicks or ten candles so but what about
two<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.310> XXL<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.120> about<00:02:49.420> 40<00:02:49.810> cents<00:02:50.110> of

large pieces of meat for Thanksgiving we

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.840 
large pieces of meat for Thanksgiving we
didn't<00:03:01.990> have<00:03:02.140> enough<00:03:02.380> oven<00:03:02.770> space<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.340> had

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
didn't have enough oven space so we had

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.750 
didn't have enough oven space so we had
a<00:03:03.880> 10<00:03:04.630> pound<00:03:04.870> duck<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.650> was<00:03:05.709> stuffed<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.550> it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
a 10 pound duck that was stuffed and it

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.330 
a 10 pound duck that was stuffed and it
took<00:03:06.910> four<00:03:07.150> hours<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.709> was<00:03:08.860> perfectly

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
took four hours and it was perfectly

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.680 
took four hours and it was perfectly
done<00:03:09.580> it<00:03:09.760> wasn't<00:03:09.910> dry<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.240> out<00:03:10.330> because<00:03:10.540> we

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
done it wasn't dry it out because we

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.020 
done it wasn't dry it out because we
were<00:03:10.750> using<00:03:10.959> radiant<00:03:11.530> energy<00:03:11.680> as<00:03:12.130> well<00:03:12.790> as

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
were using radiant energy as well as

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.360 
were using radiant energy as well as
convection<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.260> we're<00:03:14.410> not<00:03:14.530> trying<00:03:14.770> out<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
convection so we're not trying out the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.479 
convection so we're not trying out the
food<00:03:15.580> but<00:03:15.790> we're<00:03:15.940> actually<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.290> baking<00:03:17.290> it

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
food but we're actually just baking it

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.940 
food but we're actually just baking it
the<00:03:18.489> way<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.640> should<00:03:18.730> be<00:03:18.910> done<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.350> has<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
the way it should be done so it has the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.970 
the way it should be done so it has the
is<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.030> because<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.450> has<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.560> bricks<00:03:23.800> in

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
is that because it has the the bricks in

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.729 
is that because it has the the bricks in
it<00:03:24.040> yes<00:03:24.700> lady<00:03:25.209> are<00:03:25.510> they<00:03:25.660> clay<00:03:25.930> yes<00:03:26.410> there

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
it yes lady are they clay yes there

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.550 
it yes lady are they clay yes there
there<00:03:27.070> I'm<00:03:27.580> glaze<00:03:27.880> quarry<00:03:28.600> stone<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.140> by

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
there I'm glaze quarry stone and by

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.250 
there I'm glaze quarry stone and by
heating<00:03:30.070> those<00:03:30.489> up<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.269> thermal<00:03:32.230> energy

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
heating those up with the thermal energy

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.860 
heating those up with the thermal energy
it<00:03:33.040> stores<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.580> thermal<00:03:34.090> energy<00:03:34.120> acts<00:03:34.630> as<00:03:34.840> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
it stores that thermal energy acts as a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.390 
it stores that thermal energy acts as a
reservoir<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:35.920> when<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.100> put<00:03:36.280> your

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
reservoir and then when you put your

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.190 
reservoir and then when you put your
food<00:03:36.820> in<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.330> food<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.690> closest<00:03:38.110> thing

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
food in your food is the closest thing

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.440 
food in your food is the closest thing
in<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.410> room<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:39.130> energy<00:03:39.880> took<00:03:40.120> on<00:03:40.300> this

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
in the room that energy took on this

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.710 
in the room that energy took on this
belief<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:42.100> stones<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.790> goes<00:03:43.060> into<00:03:43.570> your

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
belief the the stones and goes into your

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.250 
belief the the stones and goes into your
food

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
food

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.259 
food
kind<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.040> like<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.310> Sun<00:03:45.550> will<00:03:45.700> hit<00:03:45.820> your<00:03:46.060> face

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
kind of like the Sun will hit your face

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.120 
kind of like the Sun will hit your face
if<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.959> were<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.440> shade<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.739> then<00:03:48.070> you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
if you were in the shade and then you

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.490 
if you were in the shade and then you
step<00:03:48.340> out<00:03:48.519> under<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> Sun<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> oven

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
step out under the Sun so the oven

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.350 
step out under the Sun so the oven
thermometer<00:03:50.860> isn't<00:03:51.459> as<00:03:51.580> important<00:03:52.030> or

thermometer isn't as important or

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.150 
thermometer isn't as important or
watching<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.989> time<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.739> one<00:03:53.920> thing<00:03:54.130> about

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
watching the time the one thing about

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.410 
watching the time the one thing about
these<00:03:54.400> other<00:03:54.640> suits<00:03:54.940> they're<00:03:55.060> not<00:03:55.209> airtight

these other suits they're not airtight

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.160 
these other suits they're not airtight
because<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.769> candles<00:03:57.190> need<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:58.030> fresh<00:03:58.959> air

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
because the candles need that fresh air

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.490 
because the candles need that fresh air
to<00:04:00.010> function<00:04:00.670> or<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.850> operate<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.200> you're

stainless steel it's not a good
conductor<00:04:54.080> of<00:04:54.380> thermal<00:04:54.800> energy<00:04:55.160> or<00:04:55.190> heat<00:04:55.310> so

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
conductor of thermal energy or heat so

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.660 
conductor of thermal energy or heat so
like<00:04:56.930> if<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.200> was<00:04:57.380> aluminum<00:04:57.890> it<00:04:58.520> would

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
like if this was aluminum it would

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.640 
like if this was aluminum it would
really<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:59.060> heating<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.510> kitchen<00:04:59.900> but<00:05:00.320> with

really be heating the kitchen but with

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.530 
really be heating the kitchen but with
the<00:05:00.770> stainless<00:05:00.980> steel<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.610> reflects<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.510> back

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
the stainless steel it reflects it back

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.540 
the stainless steel it reflects it back
in<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.140> we'll<00:05:03.230> show<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.470> later<00:05:03.560> through<00:05:04.340> some

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
in and we'll show you later through some

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.790 
in and we'll show you later through some
thermal<00:05:04.940> imaging<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.290> bottom<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.710> the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
thermal imaging that the bottom of the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.860 
thermal imaging that the bottom of the
oven<00:05:06.920> down<00:05:07.190> here<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.610> legs<00:05:07.790> is<00:05:08.420> actually

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
oven down here on the legs is actually

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.820 
oven down here on the legs is actually
the<00:05:08.990> same<00:05:09.230> color<00:05:09.260> as<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:10.220> countertop<00:05:10.850> so

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
the same color as the countertop so

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.990 
the same color as the countertop so
oftentimes<00:05:12.830> there<00:05:13.250> in<00:05:13.310> our<00:05:13.400> videos<00:05:13.700> we'll

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
oftentimes there in our videos we'll

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.810 
oftentimes there in our videos we'll
have<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.210> bed<00:05:14.450> sheet<00:05:14.660> down<00:05:14.870> because<00:05:15.200> it's<00:05:15.380> white

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
have a bed sheet down because it's white

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.270 
have a bed sheet down because it's white
is<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.030> better<00:05:17.270> video<00:05:17.600> and<00:05:18.170> we<00:05:18.830> can<00:05:19.040> cook

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
is this a better video and we can cook

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.100 
is this a better video and we can cook
now<00:05:19.880> I'm<00:05:19.940> not<00:05:20.150> recommending<00:05:20.330> this<00:05:20.720> but<00:05:20.990> right

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
now I'm not recommending this but right

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.080 
now I'm not recommending this but right
on<00:05:21.140> flammable<00:05:21.830> material<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.520> not<00:05:22.910> have<00:05:23.060> a

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
on flammable material and not have a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.090 
on flammable material and not have a
problem<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:24.080> these<00:05:24.530> don't<00:05:24.800> get<00:05:24.890> hot

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
problem so these don't get hot

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.870 
problem so these don't get hot
underneath<00:05:25.550> no<00:05:26.120> did<00:05:26.570> y'all<00:05:26.780> see<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.880> comes

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
underneath no did y'all see that comes

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.440 
underneath no did y'all see that comes
off<00:05:29.030> of<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.210> camera<00:05:29.620> trigger<00:05:30.620> right<00:05:31.300> but<00:05:32.300> then

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
off of the camera trigger right but then

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.450 
off of the camera trigger right but then
the<00:05:32.480> top<00:05:32.780> will<00:05:32.990> be<00:05:33.140> warm<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.860> top<00:05:34.040> will<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.340> be

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
the top will be warm the top will it be

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430 
the top will be warm the top will it be
like<00:05:34.700> burns<00:05:35.000> with<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.330> touch<00:05:35.540> or<00:05:35.840> just<00:05:36.230> like

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
like burns with a touch or just like

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.890 
like burns with a touch or just like
warm<00:05:37.010> it<00:05:37.460> will<00:05:37.640> be<00:05:37.850> hot<00:05:38.330> enough<00:05:38.450> that<00:05:38.630> you

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
warm it will be hot enough that you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.180 
warm it will be hot enough that you
could<00:05:39.020> put<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.230> pan<00:05:39.440> on<00:05:39.470> here<00:05:39.800> in<00:05:39.890> boiled<00:05:40.160> water

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
could put a pan on here in boiled water

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.780 
could put a pan on here in boiled water
oh<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:41.419> don't<00:05:42.400> touch<00:05:43.400> it

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
oh so don't touch it

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.190 
oh so don't touch it
no<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.060> would<00:05:44.360> want<00:05:44.540> to<00:05:44.630> use<00:05:44.750> some<00:05:44.930> gloves

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.570 
some oven mitts or something like that
but<00:05:50.930> some<00:05:51.110> kind<00:05:51.290> of<00:05:51.320> thermal<00:05:51.590> protection<00:05:51.980> and

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
but some kind of thermal protection and

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.850 
but some kind of thermal protection and
does<00:05:52.790> it<00:05:52.910> radiate<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.510> lot<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.840> heat<00:05:53.990> out<00:05:54.380> into

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
does it radiate a lot of heat out into

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.830 
does it radiate a lot of heat out into
the<00:05:54.980> room<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:56.330> like<00:05:56.540> would<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.750> be

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
the room so like would it be

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.450 
the room so like would it be
uncomfortable<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.740> be<00:05:57.770> cooking<00:05:58.190> in<00:05:58.370> the

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
uncomfortable to be cooking in the

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.159 
uncomfortable to be cooking in the
kitchen<00:05:58.490> with<00:05:58.940> it<00:05:59.090> no<00:05:59.450> in<00:05:59.510> fact<00:05:59.690> we<00:05:59.900> have<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.050> lot

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
kitchen with it no in fact we have a lot

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.659 
kitchen with it no in fact we have a lot
of<00:06:00.260> customers<00:06:00.620> right<00:06:00.800> now<00:06:00.830> that<00:06:01.160> use<00:06:01.340> this<00:06:01.490> in

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
of customers right now that use this in

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:02.980 
of customers right now that use this in
the<00:06:01.760> summertime<00:06:02.180> because<00:06:02.270> it<00:06:02.480> does<00:06:02.600> not<00:06:02.720> heat

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
the summertime because it does not heat

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.990 
the summertime because it does not heat
their<00:06:03.290> whole<00:06:03.530> kitchen<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.400> way<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.730> if<00:06:04.850> they

their whole kitchen the way that if they
got<00:06:05.120> their<00:06:05.330> way<00:06:05.450> that<00:06:05.660> is<00:06:06.140> a<00:06:06.350> nice<00:06:06.590> benefit

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
got their way that is a nice benefit

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.400 
got their way that is a nice benefit
yeah<00:06:07.400> because<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.880> keeps<00:06:08.750> that<00:06:08.990> thermal

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
yeah because it keeps that thermal

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.840 
yeah because it keeps that thermal
energy<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:09.830> keeps<00:06:10.040> bouncing<00:06:10.430> it<00:06:10.520> in<00:06:10.610> now<00:06:10.790> if

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
energy and keeps bouncing it in now if

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.580 
energy and keeps bouncing it in now if
this<00:06:10.970> was<00:06:11.150> aluminum<00:06:11.570> it<00:06:11.990> would<00:06:12.140> transfer

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
this was aluminum it would transfer

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.050 
this was aluminum it would transfer
through<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.890> metal<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.430> then<00:06:13.580> out<00:06:13.730> into<00:06:13.910> the

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
through the metal and then out into the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.150 
through the metal and then out into the
answer<00:06:14.510> but<00:06:15.020> this<00:06:15.260> one<00:06:15.470> does<00:06:15.650> not<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.070> it

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
answer but this one does not so it

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.460 
answer but this one does not so it
doesn't<00:06:16.460> get<00:06:16.550> warm<00:06:16.790> around<00:06:17.600> it<00:06:17.840> it<00:06:18.050> just<00:06:18.080> keeps

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
doesn't get warm around it it just keeps

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.840 
doesn't get warm around it it just keeps
it<00:06:18.590> in<00:06:18.740> there<00:06:18.890> and<00:06:19.070> then<00:06:19.400> one<00:06:19.550> of<00:06:19.640> the<00:06:19.700> nice

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
it in there and then one of the nice

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.580 
it in there and then one of the nice
things<00:06:20.060> too<00:06:20.270> is<00:06:20.419> if<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:20.990> use<00:06:21.140> half<00:06:21.410> the

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
things too is if you use half the

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.920 
things too is if you use half the
candles<00:06:22.010> in<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.280> xxo<00:06:22.820> then<00:06:23.330> it'll<00:06:23.600> work<00:06:23.720> like

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
candles in the xxo then it'll work like

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.200 
candles in the xxo then it'll work like
you're<00:06:24.200> xcalibur<00:06:24.560> your<00:06:24.950> food<00:06:25.250> dehydrator<00:06:25.430> so

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
you're xcalibur your food dehydrator so

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.300 
you're xcalibur your food dehydrator so
you<00:06:26.300> can<00:06:26.419> actually<00:06:26.540> dehydrate<00:06:27.260> food<00:06:27.500> make

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
you can actually dehydrate food make

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.540 
you can actually dehydrate food make
fruit<00:06:28.550> leather<00:06:28.790> dry<00:06:29.690> raw<00:06:30.140> nuts<00:06:30.440> it's<00:06:31.400> very

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
fruit leather dry raw nuts it's very

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.110 
fruit leather dry raw nuts it's very
versatile<00:06:32.090> so<00:06:32.440> and<00:06:33.440> then<00:06:33.650> there<00:06:33.860> again<00:06:34.130> the

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
versatile so and then there again the

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.930 
versatile so and then there again the
paraffin<00:06:35.900> wax<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:36.260> very<00:06:36.440> easy<00:06:37.039> to<00:06:37.220> store

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
paraffin wax is very easy to store

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.650 
paraffin wax is very easy to store
it's

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
it's

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.260 
it's
volatile<00:06:39.050> it's<00:06:39.410> not<00:06:39.620> going<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.860> break<00:06:40.100> down

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
volatile it's not going to break down

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.790 
volatile it's not going to break down
decompose<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:41.570> last<00:06:41.840> forever<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.530> it

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
decompose and last forever and it

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.670 
decompose and last forever and it
doubles<00:06:43.100> as<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.220> light<00:06:43.430> source<00:06:43.930> so<00:06:44.930> with<00:06:45.470> the

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
doubles as a light source so with the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.530 
doubles as a light source so with the
candles<00:06:46.370> so<00:06:46.580> they're<00:06:46.730> safe<00:06:46.910> to<00:06:47.090> store<00:06:47.270> inside

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
candles so they're safe to store inside

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.870 
candles so they're safe to store inside
