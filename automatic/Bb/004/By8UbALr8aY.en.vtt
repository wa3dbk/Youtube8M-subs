00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.150
 hi everyone out of the game you 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.469
 find for a video a little bit 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.389
 special because I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.250
 series that I started and that I do not 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 would never end in their rights while 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.710
 in fact illogical I will start with 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.630
 not finish the marquise series 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.029
 finally the PC night house and 4 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.009
 christine caste yes that's it all 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.140
 just because it does more 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.140
 little man the series is the first 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.329
 tons did not have me so much anymore and 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.300
 even though my game lend them to my sister 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.210
 she liked it but even though she 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.100
 buy more I do not think I read it 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.190
 will not see the rest of the fifth 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.480
 wave of nothing is the infinite sea that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.070
 go out in not very long 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.019
 simply because unlike 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.000
 to the rest of the planet I 'm not going 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.019
 like 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.309
 I did not succeed there are moments 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.449
 I really wanted to stop before 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.920
 it sucks me and finally frankly I 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.630
 really been disappointed by this book generated 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.310
 subsequently marine intel if 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.770
 alexander I saw that a second volume 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.200
 is out or will surf but not very 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.540
 a long time and I was a bit surprised 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.490
 because it did not deserve a second 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 volume for me and me that annoys me 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 books that have a second volume then 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 they do not deserve this one I 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.670
 did not like it because it's not my 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.550
 favorite area the vampires 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.950
 but the creatures sex etc etc 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.110
 although I think it may please 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.050
 a lot of people this is really a case 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.460
 exceptional but I will not go later 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.280
 in your just because I have 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.050
 loved the first volume and I have so much 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.960
 afraid of being disappointed I saw some critics 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.450
 so negative that I want to keep 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.030
 a good picture of this book is to have 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 read that first tome that to read the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.780
 second volume is to have an image a 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.460
 little less positive generated subsequently 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.230
 a craving for sweet 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.600
 macabo all because the first volume 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.650
 had very moderately pleased and I have the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.120
 lazy to read more 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.860
 I have very few memories of vampires 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.320
 of manhattan of melissa of the cruz 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.619
 but all I care is the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.190
 negative so I will not read more 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.130
 no there is blonde side mcc abbott who does not 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.480
 did not deserve follow me anyway 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.950
 26 and I was pretty happy with the first 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.150
 volume which I absolutely do not want to 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
 spoil the image of this series 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.320
 especially in my opinion if following this 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.270
 is going to be a completely useless thing 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.070
 who does not have that in every way so 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.870
 the first volume was rather well done 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.790
 and pretty cool plot 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.670
 and here and anyway I gave them to him 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
 very long this one so if I have 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.430
 relapse the second volume I have with me 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:46.810
 you lie lost neither his later indulge 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.040
 apparently not bad but frankly 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 I was so disgusted by the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.330
 first volume that I will never read the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.250
 Following a fukuda draw for me it's bye 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.410
 bye at the time that I had I had 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.620
 loved my life according to me sylvaine jaoui 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.270
 but now I think I was a 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.390
 little too late for me to read it I 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.370
 am a little too old and I think 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.470
 even if I read it again and I reread 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
 this one down I'll really be bored 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.260
 surprise of the century 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.520
 attention there is going to be a sequel to the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.580
 perfect woman loss to be a bitch 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.260
 this thing absolutely not literary 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.490
 so not funny is going to have a sequel 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.050
 no but wait he 'll want 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.970
 buy her daughter as well as have it all 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.530
 just because you're a fifth 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.160
 is already at the time I saw that found 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.990
 really kid is so here even though I 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.990
 know that everyone loves this series 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.720
 I will not read and finish not 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.490
 to vote I will not finish the series 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.800
 pantyhose of the sun-king dannemarie 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.780
 of esplas simply because 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.290
 I read if tom hicks hama files 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.980
 really I had read them when I was 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.709
 in fifth 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.080
 at the time I had liked so is the 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.090
 sixth volume froze the head in fourth he 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.220
 so here I said to myself but how 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.000
 I could yesterday sam 1 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.130
 at first it's good it's funny boring 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.540
 by a small conclusion to this video 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.580
 I find that there is far too much 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.170
 books now that they are made 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.480
 during a suite according to me ie 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.590
 that marc and wait 10 volumes is 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540
 really exaggerated 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.760
 who is this going to buy said man 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.320
 waiting for the only series when I bought 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.080
 more items is the diary of a 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.459
 princess when I was in 6th 5th and 4th 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.110
 but here I find that ten volumes 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.330
 it's really exaggerated then there are 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.850
 books like emergency blonde who make 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.480
 that they do not need more and that's 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.580
 so well 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.000
 to have a book where there is no more 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.380
 to buy as I can send some 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840
 flowers for once the opposite back 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.550
 it's a book that is a bit of an ostal 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.020
 opposite and there is only one top and 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.760
 that's what I like a little bit 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.140
 design people it changes them because there 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.030
 the books they were successful 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.510
 last year of twilight harry potter and 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.050
 always 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.460
 it was trilogy of dogs and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.140
 that's all for this little girl 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.640
 video and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.960
 with you will not scream too much at 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.850
 scandal because I would have criticized 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.170
 your series pampered the fund on oneself 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.610
 the fifth ring and the girls in 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.890
 chocolate that everyone will love it 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.640
 in short we find ourselves very quickly for a 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.150
 new video 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.150
 kisses
