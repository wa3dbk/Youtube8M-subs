that<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.140> comments<00:02:17.670> why<00:02:18.670> but<00:02:19.210> I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
that down in the comments why but I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.740 
that down in the comments why but I
think<00:02:19.480> every<00:02:19.840> game<00:02:20.260> type<00:02:20.500> has<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.270> has<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
think every game type has it has it the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.940 
think every game type has it has it the
best<00:02:22.960> map<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.510> found<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.170> playing

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
best map for it and I found that playing

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.780 
best map for it and I found that playing
on<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.370> firing<00:02:27.730> range<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.860> really<00:02:30.160> good<00:02:30.460> for

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
on on firing range it is really good for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.090 
on on firing range it is really good for
capture<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.630> flag<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.680> stick<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.070> the

kills<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.350> think<00:03:08.590> with<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.950> silencer

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
kills I think with the silencer

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.770 
kills I think with the silencer
returning<00:03:11.739> flags<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.330> good<00:03:13.900> way<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
returning flags so a good way to get and

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.509 
returning flags so a good way to get and
it<00:03:17.080> besides<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:17.709> you're<00:03:17.920> just<00:03:18.100> your<00:03:18.310> team

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
it besides like you're just your team

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.310 
it besides like you're just your team
deathmatch<00:03:19.030> where<00:03:19.330> you<00:03:19.989> would<00:03:20.140> get

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
racking up myself 750 kills not 75 but I

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.770 
racking up myself 750 kills not 75 but I
mean<00:03:38.650> that's<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:40.030> doesn't<00:03:40.299> matter<00:03:40.420> see<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.690> in
