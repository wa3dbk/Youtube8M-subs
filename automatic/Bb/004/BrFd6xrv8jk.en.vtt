 this I have to open it like this 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.990
 yes because if it's not worth it here next 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.990

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.880
 simply unzip it where 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.740
 you want and but this I'm going to erase 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.900

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.310
 launcher 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.110
 It's worth it , everything is normal 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.910
 to see if now it opens that sometimes 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.600
 when it closes it completely it takes 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.210
 but to the party 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.340
 worth here he will expose endow that he also 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.460
 can for the dota and starcraft we 're going 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.770
 to be here to proust and where you have 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.630

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.580
 open I 'll open it to window mode 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.230
 so you can see it because with the screen 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.920
 full name of starcraft software 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.920
 OK 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.920
 and it is already 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.600
 it is still simple that you want to open it mode 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.070
 window because you see it in window mode here 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:27.210
 no then we're not going to multiplayer to the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.300
 expansion to the original will leave us 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.389
 the expansion 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.050
 and here, as you can see , the abyss does not appear 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.050
 and ccoo 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.000
 we open accept forgiveness 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.610

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.280
 having a player profile and here you put 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.980

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:59.210
 so here is joining and all that you see 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.220
 here are servers and if you do not have 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.150
 enough then to say that they believe 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.150
 you can also play with friends 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.480
 You see here you can have friends but I do not 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.480
 I have 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:18.339

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:22.389
 absolutely nothing else I'm going to leave 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.389
 and well this is the whole game 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.560
 and it is already 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.630
 you do not have to do anything more good guys 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.150
 I hope you liked that you have 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.940
 fun with it that you have learned 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.460
 how to play it and dislike if it has not 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.960
 liked to put in the comments if there 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.569
 some failure 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.449
 so one thing about the colors will have 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:49.200
 agreed all the colors when you open 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:53.840
 the game in full screen 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:57.300
 april or to the tab you open the 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.300
 task manager and you're going to 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.880
 where they put explorer point excel not 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.850
