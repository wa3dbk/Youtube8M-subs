and<00:00:25.170> I've<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.830> been<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> test<00:00:26.519> drive<00:00:26.580> in

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
and I've just been for a test drive in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.839 
and I've just been for a test drive in
the<00:00:27.480> vehicle<00:00:27.930> watch<00:00:28.800> my<00:00:29.010> other<00:00:29.039> video<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> see

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the vehicle watch my other video to see

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
the vehicle watch my other video to see
the<00:00:29.880> test<00:00:30.210> drive<00:00:30.619> it's<00:00:31.619> absolutely<00:00:32.160> freaking

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the test drive it's absolutely freaking

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870 
the test drive it's absolutely freaking
me<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.850> how<00:00:33.270> well<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.660> car<00:00:34.200> goes<00:00:34.730> all<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
me out how well this car goes all the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:48.380 
me out how well this car goes all the
latest<00:00:36.090> technology<00:00:37.079> from<00:00:37.290> Japan<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:47.390> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
latest technology from Japan as it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
latest technology from Japan as it's
quite<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> narrow<00:00:48.960> car<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.559> designed<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> see

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
quite a narrow car it's designed to see

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
quite a narrow car it's designed to see
for<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.149> adults<00:00:51.620> very<00:00:52.620> comfortably<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
for for adults very comfortably and it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720 
for for adults very comfortably and it
just<00:00:55.559> drives<00:00:55.800> unbelievable<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
just drives unbelievable it's a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.260 
just drives unbelievable it's a
turbocharged<00:00:57.539> 600<00:00:58.379> cc

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
turbocharged 600 cc

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.570 
turbocharged 600 cc
so<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:03.500> think<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> technology<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so I think with the technology of the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.890 
so I think with the technology of the
variable<00:01:06.060> valve<00:01:06.299> timing<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> turbo<00:01:08.900> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
variable valve timing the turbo this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.520 
variable valve timing the turbo this
thing<00:01:10.140> absolutely<00:01:10.260> flies<00:01:11.299> now<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.500> made<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thing absolutely flies now I just made a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.030 
thing absolutely flies now I just made a

so<00:01:16.030> my<00:01:16.180> colleague<00:01:17.010> is<00:01:18.010> selling<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.430> lot<00:01:18.580> of

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
so my colleague is selling a lot of

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.630 
so my colleague is selling a lot of
innocent<00:01:19.330> cubes<00:01:19.660> recently<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.920> thing<00:01:21.280> will

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
innocent cubes recently this thing will

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.790 
innocent cubes recently this thing will
blow<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> cube<00:01:22.480> out<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.870> water<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.350> terms<00:01:23.530> of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
blow a cube out of the water in terms of

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.730 
blow a cube out of the water in terms of
performance<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:24.460> Anisa<00:01:24.850> cube<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.590> you're

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
performance so Anisa cube if you're

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.240 
performance so Anisa cube if you're
driven<00:01:27.010> one<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.160> those<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.580> a<00:01:27.670> 1.4<00:01:28.330> liter<00:01:29.250> non

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250

so you can turn the car on and off

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.590 
so you can turn the car on and off
without<00:02:26.770> having<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.160> take<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.459> key<00:02:27.700> out<00:02:27.970> of

very<00:02:34.670> very<00:02:34.910> compact<00:02:35.300> design

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.560 

I<00:02:45.560> tried<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.250> get<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.550> car<00:02:46.820> out<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.240> direct

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
I tried to get the car out of the direct

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.590 
I tried to get the car out of the direct
sunlight<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.970> get<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> good<00:02:50.240> idea<00:02:50.360> of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
sunlight so you can get a good idea of
