shield and start away from the wall a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.710 
shield and start away from the wall a
little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> said<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
little bit you know like I said it's a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
little bit you know like I said it's a
roller<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> brush<00:01:14.250> fits<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.670> behind

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
roller and then the brush fits in behind

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
roller and then the brush fits in behind
it<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.659> brush<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> actually<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.500> does

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
it and the brush is actually what does

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
it and the brush is actually what does
the<00:01:16.799> final<00:01:17.159> cutting<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.390> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the final cutting and that is what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.420 
the final cutting and that is what
allows<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> edge

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
allows you to get right up to the edge

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
allows you to get right up to the edge
without<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.570> brush<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.619> doesn't<00:01:22.950> work<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
without that brush this doesn't work so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.429 
without that brush this doesn't work so
the<00:01:24.150> roller<00:01:24.330> basically<00:01:24.810> puts<00:01:25.020> paint<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the roller basically puts paint on the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
the roller basically puts paint on the
wall<00:01:25.619> first<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.400> then<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> brush<00:01:27.240> comes

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
wall first and then the brush comes

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
wall first and then the brush comes
behind<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> moves<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> paint<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.369> up

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
behind it and moves that paint right up

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
behind it and moves that paint right up
to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> edge<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.360> you're<00:01:30.509> never<00:01:30.689> actually

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to the edge so you're never actually

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.920 
to the edge so you're never actually
putting<00:01:31.500> paint<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.310> brush<00:01:32.430> itself<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
putting paint on the brush itself so it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.230 
putting paint on the brush itself so it
makes<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> very<00:01:34.259> fast<00:01:34.650> operation<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
makes it a very fast operation the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
makes it a very fast operation the
consistency<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> results<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> painting

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
of doing it on the market so what we've

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.310 
of doing it on the market so what we've

or learning how to use a paintbrush and
you<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.530> because<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.950> skill<00:03:35.190> set

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
you know that because that's a skill set

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.520 
you know that because that's a skill set
that<00:03:35.550> takes<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:36.000> lot<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.810> practice<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.350> mean<00:03:37.380> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
that takes a lot of practice I mean it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.570 
that takes a lot of practice I mean it
takes<00:03:37.650> years<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.010> practice<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
takes years of practice for a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.670 
takes years of practice for a
professional<00:03:38.970> cleaner<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.570> so<00:03:40.470> this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
professional cleaner to do that so this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
professional cleaner to do that so this
basically<00:03:41.220> overcomes<00:03:41.790> those<00:03:41.970> problems<00:03:42.420> it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
basically overcomes those problems it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.170 
basically overcomes those problems it
combines<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.580> like<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.820> said<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
combines you know like I said it's a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.420 
combines you know like I said it's a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
roller and then the brush fits in behind

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.070 
roller and then the brush fits in behind
it<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.090> brush<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.480> actually<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:48.930> does

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
it and the brush is actually what does

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.350 
it and the brush is actually what does
the<00:03:49.230> final<00:03:49.620> cutting<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.850> what

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the final cutting and that is what

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.850 
the final cutting and that is what
allows<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.170> get<00:03:52.260> right<00:03:52.440> up<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> edge

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
allows you to get right up to the edge

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.509 
allows you to get right up to the edge
without<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.940> brush<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:55.019> doesn't<00:03:55.320> work

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
without that brush this doesn't work

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.130 
without that brush this doesn't work
we've<00:03:56.519> patented<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.300> it's<00:03:57.900> now

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
we've patented it and it's now

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.350
