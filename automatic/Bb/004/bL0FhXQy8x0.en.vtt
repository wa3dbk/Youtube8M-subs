00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
they have red eyes so Bob's going to say

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.440 
they have red eyes so Bob's going to say
he<00:01:34.340> saw<00:01:34.520> his<00:01:34.700> daughter<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:36.470> hunting<00:01:36.950> store

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
he saw his daughter in the hunting store

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.640 
he saw his daughter in the hunting store
now<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.570> won't<00:01:38.720> happen<00:01:38.900> until<00:01:39.170> exactly
