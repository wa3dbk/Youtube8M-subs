hey guys I have another video for you
and<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.389> actually<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.929> tag<00:00:04.319> video<00:00:04.620> as<00:00:05.220> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
and this is actually a tag video as you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
and this is actually a tag video as you
could<00:00:05.580> probably<00:00:05.700> tell<00:00:06.060> from<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.509> title<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
could probably tell from the title and

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.680 
could probably tell from the title and
this<00:00:07.919> would<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.370> first<00:00:08.400> tag<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.630> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
this would be my first tag video and I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.110 
this would be my first tag video and I
was<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.080> requested<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.070> do<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.090> I

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
was actually requested to do it so I

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.099 
was actually requested to do it so I
figured<00:00:12.570> why<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.590> called<00:00:14.120> nail<00:00:15.120> polish

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
figured why not it's called nail polish

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.950 
figured why not it's called nail polish
obsession<00:00:16.800> tag<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.580> has<00:00:17.820> 10<00:00:18.390> questions

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.340 
obsession tag and it has 10 questions

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.389 
like more than others but there's not
just<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.360> brand<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
just one brand that I really like the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.490 
just one brand that I really like the
reason<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> most<00:01:54.329> OPI<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.869> because

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
reason I have the most OPI is because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
reason I have the most OPI is because
that's<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> nail<00:01:56.130> polish<00:01:56.460> Fran<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> was

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that's the nail polish Fran that I was

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.569 
that's the nail polish Fran that I was
exposed<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.320> most<00:01:58.500> when<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> first<00:01:59.369> started

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
exposed to the most when I first started

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.240 
exposed to the most when I first started
out<00:02:00.049> getting<00:02:01.049> nail<00:02:01.200> polish<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.649> purchasing

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
out getting nail polish and purchasing

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.230 
out getting nail polish and purchasing
it<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.170> second<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> SC<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.000> didn't

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it and second is SC and I really didn't

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.999 
it and second is SC and I really didn't
like<00:02:06.360> SC<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> beginning<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.530> ever<00:02:07.740> since

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
like SC in the beginning but ever since

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.949 
like SC in the beginning but ever since
L'Oreal<00:02:08.489> bought<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.940> over<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.810> much

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
L'Oreal bought them over there so much

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.010 
L'Oreal bought them over there so much
more<00:02:10.229> easily<00:02:10.440> accessible<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.489> they're<00:02:12.209> also

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
more easily accessible and they're also

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.150 
more easily accessible and they're also
I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> formula<00:02:14.460> has<00:02:14.580> changed<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.120> lot<00:02:15.270> so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I think the formula has changed a lot so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.090 
I think the formula has changed a lot so
it<00:02:17.160> would<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> tie<00:02:17.820> OPI<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.780> SC<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
it would be a tie OPI and SC but if I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
it would be a tie OPI and SC but if I
had<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.700> pick<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.660> probably<00:02:21.960> be<00:02:22.410> se

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
had to pick one it would probably be se

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.870 
had to pick one it would probably be se
number<00:02:24.120> two<00:02:24.360> glitter<00:02:25.290> or<00:02:25.590> no<00:02:25.860> glitter<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.460> I

right here this is Zoya Harlow and I

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.540 
right here this is Zoya Harlow and I
just<00:04:47.289> don't<00:04:47.469> like<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.830> way<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.069> looks<00:04:48.099> pretty

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
just don't like the way it looks pretty

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.110 
just don't like the way it looks pretty
much<00:04:48.879> I<00:04:49.360> only<00:04:50.110> use<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.800> once<00:04:51.400> or<00:04:51.580> twice<00:04:51.699> and

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
much I only use that once or twice and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.540 
much I only use that once or twice and
that's<00:04:52.270> just<00:04:52.539> because<00:04:52.719> I<00:04:53.280> could<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.310> throw

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
that's just because I could just throw

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.850 
that's just because I could just throw
it<00:04:54.849> on<00:04:54.939> without<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.419> base<00:04:55.689> coat<00:04:55.930> or<00:04:56.080> topcoat<00:04:56.590> and

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
it on without a base coat or topcoat and

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.730 
it on without a base coat or topcoat and
it's<00:04:57.639> good<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.479> go<00:04:58.659> but<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.110> doesn't<00:04:59.379> last<00:04:59.530> very

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
it's good to go but it doesn't last very

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.260 
it's good to go but it doesn't last very
long<00:04:59.949> on<00:05:00.250> your<00:05:00.370> nails<00:05:00.520> like<00:05:00.789> that<00:05:01.060> so

long on your nails like that so

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.260 
long on your nails like that so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.209 
definitely not Matt 9 French manicure I
never<00:05:07.270> give<00:05:07.509> myself<00:05:07.659> a<00:05:07.990> French<00:05:08.229> manicure<00:05:08.440> just

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
never give myself a French manicure just

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.800 
never give myself a French manicure just
because<00:05:09.490> I'm<00:05:09.639> really<00:05:09.819> bad<00:05:10.120> at<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.539> but

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
because I'm really bad at it but

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.860 
because I'm really bad at it but
whenever<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:11.500> go<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.860> get<00:05:12.219> my<00:05:12.370> nails<00:05:12.580> done

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
whenever I go to get my nails done

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.869 
whenever I go to get my nails done
professionally<00:05:13.870> at<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.080> salon<00:05:14.469> I<00:05:14.879> always

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:15.879 
professionally at the salon I always

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.089 
professionally at the salon I always
consider<00:05:16.330> doing<00:05:16.629> a<00:05:16.840> French<00:05:17.169> on<00:05:17.379> my<00:05:17.560> toes<00:05:17.830> or

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
consider doing a French on my toes or

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.369 
consider doing a French on my toes or
fingernails<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.180> that's<00:05:19.719> definitely<00:05:20.020> an

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
fingernails so that's definitely an

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.890 
fingernails so that's definitely an
option<00:05:20.529> I<00:05:20.919> would<00:05:20.979> consider<00:05:21.599> number<00:05:22.599> 10

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
option I would consider number 10

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.070
