00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.510 
a little hole here and then put a little
loop<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.340> getting<00:01:00.260> getting<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:01.530> too

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
loop here I was getting getting some too

much<00:01:02.670> water<00:01:02.880> in<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.360> filter<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.259> put<00:01:05.039> a<00:01:05.069> little

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
much water in the filter so put a little

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
much water in the filter so put a little
bit<00:01:05.399> of<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> loop<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:05.939> don't<00:01:06.119> seem<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.359> stop

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
bit of a loop there I don't seem to stop

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.620 
bit of a loop there I don't seem to stop
most<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.319> and<00:01:08.179> that<00:01:09.179> goes<00:01:09.329> back<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
most of it and that goes back down in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.649 
most of it and that goes back down in
into<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.749> bottom<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:14.119> filter<00:01:15.119> container

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
into the bottom of the filter container

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
into the bottom of the filter container
there<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.649> your<00:01:16.859> is<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> drop<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
there and there's your is the drop of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.050 
there and there's your is the drop of
the<00:01:17.819> drain<00:01:18.030> hose<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.700> comes<00:01:20.789> back

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the drain hose and then that comes back

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.539 
the drain hose and then that comes back
up<00:01:21.590> right<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:23.659> do<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:26.399> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
up right there do this and this and this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.069 
up right there do this and this and this
flashing<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.119> why<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:27.539> check<00:01:27.840> valve

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
flashing is why when we check valve

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.469 
flashing is why when we check valve
there<00:01:28.490> right<00:01:29.490> there<00:01:31.609> it<00:01:32.609> goes<00:01:32.789> up<00:01:33.030> underneath

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
there right there it goes up underneath

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:49.639 
there right there it goes up underneath
my<00:01:33.630> hurry<00:01:33.929> box<00:01:35.479> back<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:46.819> goes<00:01:47.819> to<00:01:48.649> right
