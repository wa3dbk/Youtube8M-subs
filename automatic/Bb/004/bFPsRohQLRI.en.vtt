that<00:00:41.200> for<00:00:41.350> a<00:00:41.590> while<00:00:41.830> I<00:00:42.190> did<00:00:42.730> like<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.090> idea<00:00:43.420> I

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
that for a while I did like the idea I

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.900 
that for a while I did like the idea I
did<00:00:43.960> want<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.560> be<00:00:44.830> in<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.250> game<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.670> could

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
did want it to be in the game we could

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.150 
did want it to be in the game we could
buy<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> Supply<00:00:46.630> Drop<00:00:46.690> but<00:00:47.560> I<00:00:47.650> didn't<00:00:47.950> think

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
buy a Supply Drop but I didn't think

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.640 
buy a Supply Drop but I didn't think
it'd<00:00:48.250> be<00:00:48.280> as<00:00:48.580> expensive<00:00:49.150> as<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.540> did<00:00:50.290> actually

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
it'd be as expensive as I did actually

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.010 
it'd be as expensive as I did actually
thought<00:00:51.220> it<00:00:51.430> would<00:00:51.640> be<00:00:51.820> because<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:52.720> about

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
thought it would be because it's about

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.960 
thought it would be because it's about
twenty<00:00:53.350> dollars<00:00:53.620> for<00:00:53.800> about<00:00:54.010> thirteen<00:00:54.580> supply

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
twenty dollars for about thirteen supply

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.550 
twenty dollars for about thirteen supply
drops<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.480> if<00:00:55.540> you<00:00:55.660> live<00:00:55.870> in<00:00:55.900> Australia<00:00:56.440> where

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
drops and if you live in Australia where

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.820 
drops and if you live in Australia where
I<00:00:56.590> do<00:00:56.770> it's<00:00:57.070> about<00:00:57.360> $26<00:00:58.360> for<00:00:58.810> 13<00:00:59.320> advanced

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
I do it's about $26 for 13 advanced

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.590 
I do it's about $26 for 13 advanced
supply<00:01:00.220> drugs<00:01:00.460> which<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.730> actually<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:01.030> lot<00:01:01.450> of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
supply drugs which is actually a lot of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.780 
supply drugs which is actually a lot of
money<00:01:01.630> if<00:01:02.020> you<00:01:02.140> quite<00:01:02.440> think<00:01:02.770> about<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
money if you quite think about the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.189 
money if you quite think about the
amount<00:01:03.910> of<00:01:04.150> leads<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.629> you<00:01:04.839> could<00:01:04.989> possibly

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
amount of leads that you could possibly

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.960 
amount of leads that you could possibly
get<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:05.950> as<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.310> already<00:01:06.400> know<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.850> these

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
get so as you already know in these

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.210 
get so as you already know in these
advanced<00:01:07.390> supply<00:01:07.689> drops<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.979> have<00:01:09.130> an

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
advanced supply drops basically have an

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.919 
advanced supply drops basically have an
increased<00:01:09.759> chance<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.240> getting<00:01:10.539> elite

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
increased chance of getting elite

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:12.810 
increased chance of getting elite
weapons<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.679> as<00:01:12.159> you<00:01:12.310> guys<00:01:12.490> all<00:01:12.789> know

weapons and as you guys all know

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.209 
weapons and as you guys all know
basically<00:01:13.499> ecology<00:01:14.499> I<00:01:14.530> guess<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.920> could<00:01:14.979> say

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
basically ecology I guess you could say

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.609 
basically ecology I guess you could say
has<00:01:15.399> been<00:01:15.640> going<00:01:15.909> downhill<00:01:16.359> ever<00:01:17.350> since

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
has been going downhill ever since

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.340 
has been going downhill ever since
ghosts<00:01:18.429> and<00:01:18.729> advanced<00:01:19.420> warfare<00:01:19.840> has<00:01:20.049> brought

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
ghosts and advanced warfare has brought

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.419 
ghosts and advanced warfare has brought
it<00:01:20.469> up<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.710> little<00:01:20.859> bit<00:01:20.979> they've<00:01:21.280> been

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
it up a little bit they've been

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.609 
it up a little bit they've been
implementing<00:01:22.090> new<00:01:22.119> changes<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.049> what<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.229> love

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
implementing new changes and what I love

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.559

about<00:01:23.679> sledgehammer<00:01:24.369> games<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.390> they're

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
about sledgehammer games is that they're

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.450 
about sledgehammer games is that they're
pretty<00:01:25.810> much<00:01:25.840> adding<00:01:26.409> new<00:01:26.590> stuff<00:01:26.619> each<00:01:27.159> week

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
pretty much adding new stuff each week

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.730 
pretty much adding new stuff each week
nothing<00:01:27.909> too<00:01:28.119> much<00:01:28.329> groundbreaking<00:01:29.170> but

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
nothing too much groundbreaking but

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.989 
nothing too much groundbreaking but
something<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.130> little<00:01:30.310> bit<00:01:30.490> different<00:01:30.850> each

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
something a little bit different each

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.270 
something a little bit different each
time<00:01:31.030> we<00:01:31.450> play<00:01:31.719> and<00:01:31.990> by<00:01:32.140> doing<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:32.770> makes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280

and<00:01:39.399> using<00:01:40.270> supply<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:40.659> was<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.049> good<00:01:41.499> our<00:01:41.770> way

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and using supply just was a good our way

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.039 
and using supply just was a good our way
to<00:01:42.159> I<00:01:42.700> guess<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.240> could<00:01:43.359> say<00:01:43.509> get<00:01:43.719> people

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
to I guess you could say get people

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.779 
to I guess you could say get people
involved<00:01:44.409> in<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.799> game<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.159> get<00:01:45.310> more<00:01:45.429> people

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
involved in the game and get more people

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.090 
involved in the game and get more people
to<00:01:45.819> buy<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.659> in<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.899> business<00:01:47.109> side<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.649> does

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
to buy and in the business side it does

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.980 
to buy and in the business side it does
make<00:01:48.310> call<00:01:48.579> of<00:01:48.729> duty<00:01:48.969> even<00:01:49.329> richer<00:01:49.840> if

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
make call of duty even richer if

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.469 
make call of duty even richer if
anything<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:50.829> what<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.429> will<00:01:51.700> say<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.999> even

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
anything and what I will say is even

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.239 
anything and what I will say is even
though<00:01:52.719> these<00:01:52.869> supply<00:01:53.200> drops<00:01:53.499> do<00:01:53.679> cost<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.130> lot

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
though these supply drops do cost a lot

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.709 
though these supply drops do cost a lot
of<00:01:54.310> money<00:01:54.429> they're<00:01:54.759> making<00:01:54.789> heaps<00:01:55.329> of<00:01:55.509> money

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
of money they're making heaps of money

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.410 
of money they're making heaps of money
out<00:01:56.139> of<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.530> if<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.740> take<00:01:56.920> fee<00:01:57.249> for<00:01:57.549> csgo<00:01:58.030> in

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
out of and if you take fee for csgo in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.020 
out of and if you take fee for csgo in
retrospect<00:01:59.249> basically<00:02:00.249> they've<00:02:00.490> done<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
retrospect basically they've done the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.179 
retrospect basically they've done the
marketplace<00:02:01.810> right<00:02:01.990> we<00:02:02.439> can<00:02:02.590> actually<00:02:02.829> buy

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
marketplace right we can actually buy

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.859 
marketplace right we can actually buy
plays<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.850> stuff<00:02:03.999> we've<00:02:04.209> been<00:02:04.359> asking<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
plays and stuff we've been asking to

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.480 
plays and stuff we've been asking to
actually<00:02:05.289> have<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> trading<00:02:06.009> market<00:02:06.369> in

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
actually have a trading market in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.490 
actually have a trading market in
advanced<00:02:07.240> warfare<00:02:07.749> that<00:02:07.929> ever<00:02:08.110> does<00:02:08.380> come

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
advanced warfare that ever does come

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.440 
advanced warfare that ever does come
around<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:09.069> would<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.369> absolutely<00:02:09.789> amazing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
around that would be absolutely amazing

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.360 
around that would be absolutely amazing
but<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.290> don't<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.920> that<00:02:12.040> coming

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
but I don't actually see that coming

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.009 
but I don't actually see that coming
around<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.940> future<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.599> when<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> comes

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
around in the future but when it comes

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.350 
around in the future but when it comes
down<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.260> supply<00:02:14.769> drops<00:02:15.099> what<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:16.060> say<00:02:16.090> is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
down to supply drops what I will say is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.660 
down to supply drops what I will say is
that<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:17.019> you<00:02:17.170> are<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.379> mediocre<00:02:18.069> person

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
that if you are a mediocre person

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.760 
that if you are a mediocre person
average<00:02:19.060> gamer<00:02:19.360> who<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.780> plays<00:02:19.990> advanced

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
average gamer who just plays advanced

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.680 
average gamer who just plays advanced

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.210 
warfare on the down low sometimes you
play<00:02:22.870> sometimes<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.010> probably

much<00:02:27.970> money<00:02:28.000> you'll<00:02:28.420> probably<00:02:28.630> go<00:02:28.900> ahead<00:02:29.020> and

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
much money you'll probably go ahead and

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.949 
much money you'll probably go ahead and
maybe<00:02:29.920> buy<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> few<00:02:31.030> supply<00:02:31.360> dress<00:02:31.599> maybe<00:02:31.720> just

people like average game is spending

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.110 
people like average game is spending
like<00:02:45.970> 200-300<00:02:46.870> dollars<00:02:47.500> on<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.310> supply<00:02:48.700> drops

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
like 200-300 dollars on the supply drops

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.190 
like 200-300 dollars on the supply drops

anything is nothing wrong with that is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.250 
anything is nothing wrong with that is
just<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.120> lot<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.569> money<00:02:52.690> for<00:02:53.110> some

elites<00:02:53.620> I've<00:02:53.769> seen<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:53.980> few<00:02:54.310> elite<00:02:54.670> videos

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
elites I've seen a few elite videos

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.940 
elites I've seen a few elite videos
especially<00:02:55.330> where<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.110> open<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.530> hundred

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
especially where they open a hundred

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.009 
especially where they open a hundred
times<00:02:57.220> advanced<00:02:58.060> supply<00:02:58.420> drops<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
times advanced supply drops and

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.500 
times advanced supply drops and
basically<00:02:59.440> what<00:02:59.980> they<00:03:00.160> get<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.580> about<00:03:00.850> 10<00:03:01.209> to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
basically what they get is about 10 to

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.680 
basically what they get is about 10 to
11<00:03:02.019> elites<00:03:02.560> hour<00:03:02.860> per<00:03:03.489> supply<00:03:03.970> drop<00:03:04.299> or<00:03:04.510> more

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
11 elites hour per supply drop or more

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 
11 elites hour per supply drop or more
or<00:03:04.780> less<00:03:04.930> out<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.230> all<00:03:05.500> those<00:03:05.650> 100<00:03:06.310> supply

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
or less out of all those 100 supply

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.330 
or less out of all those 100 supply
drops<00:03:07.450> they<00:03:07.600> get<00:03:07.810> they<00:03:07.959> got<00:03:08.170> 10<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.709> 11<00:03:09.069> elites

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
drops they get they got 10 to 11 elites

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.100 
drops they get they got 10 to 11 elites
which<00:03:09.489> is<00:03:09.610> actually<00:03:09.850> kind<00:03:10.299> of<00:03:10.360> staggering<00:03:10.870> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
which is actually kind of staggering and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.890 
which is actually kind of staggering and
when<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:12.040> open<00:03:12.400> up<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.670> 13<00:03:13.090> supply<00:03:13.450> drops<00:03:13.750> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
when you open up the 13 supply drops you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
when you open up the 13 supply drops you
only<00:03:14.019> get<00:03:14.260> about<00:03:14.350> one<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.980> two<00:03:15.010> elites<00:03:15.489> as<00:03:15.610> well

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
only get about one to two elites as well

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.039 
only get about one to two elites as well
so<00:03:15.970> you're<00:03:16.120> also<00:03:16.269> got<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.600> think<00:03:16.750> about<00:03:16.810> the

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
so you're also got to think about the

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.080 
so you're also got to think about the
chances<00:03:17.470> they<00:03:17.590> implement<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.760> once<00:03:18.940> again

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
chances they implement but once again

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.759 
chances they implement but once again
it's<00:03:19.390> also<00:03:19.630> down<00:03:20.019> on<00:03:20.200> luck<00:03:20.380> but<00:03:20.560> what<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.709> will

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
it's also down on luck but what I will

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.559 
it's also down on luck but what I will
say<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> future<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:21.880> when<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.239> comes<00:03:22.420> down

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
say in the future is when it comes down

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.479 
say in the future is when it comes down
to<00:03:22.630> supply<00:03:23.049> drops<00:03:23.350> they<00:03:23.769> might<00:03:24.040> add<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.340> into

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
to supply drops they might add it into

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.890 
to supply drops they might add it into
the<00:03:24.700> next<00:03:24.940> Call<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.150> Duty<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:25.540> will<00:03:25.660> never<00:03:25.840> know
