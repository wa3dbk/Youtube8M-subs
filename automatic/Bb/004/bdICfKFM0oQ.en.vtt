taken completely apart the PC board and
cable<00:03:14.610> wasn't<00:03:14.850> needed<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.450> wrap<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.900> up

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960

second drill bit so I drilled a few
holes<00:03:40.830> along<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.400> line<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.060> use<00:03:42.270> the<00:03:42.450> rotary

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
holes along that line and use the rotary

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.040 
holes along that line and use the rotary

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.930 
average super glue when it was messy I
submitted<00:03:58.590> both<00:03:58.800> sides<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.430> sink<00:03:59.700> head
