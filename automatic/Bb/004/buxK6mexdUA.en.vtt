00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.310 

you<00:01:19.700> know<00:01:19.820> times<00:01:20.360> like<00:01:20.510> this<00:01:20.720> can<00:01:20.960> be<00:01:21.110> very

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
you know times like this can be very

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.110 
you know times like this can be very
very<00:01:21.470> tough<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.950> sometimes<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.550> think<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
very tough and sometimes I think the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.640 
very tough and sometimes I think the
most<00:01:23.270> amazing<00:01:23.750> thing<00:01:23.900> is<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.050> sometimes<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
most amazing thing is that sometimes the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.440 
most amazing thing is that sometimes the
most<00:01:24.800> unexpected<00:01:25.160> people<00:01:25.880> are<00:01:26.000> not<00:01:26.120> saying<00:01:26.360> in

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
her case but I think sometimes the most

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.770 
her case but I think sometimes the most
unexpected<00:01:28.070> people<00:01:28.760> come<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.330> come<00:01:29.630> into
