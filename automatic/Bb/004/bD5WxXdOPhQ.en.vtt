00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.550
 or minute and a half nothing else 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.979
 the one that does not have microwave also what

 they can make as if they were tamales 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.220
 now say that one is going to avoid 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.429
 ends to put in this bag and already 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 they do not get to heat in the lava by 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.080
