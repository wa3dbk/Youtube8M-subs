one<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.460> challenges<00:01:23.000> that<00:01:23.030> we<00:01:23.330> have<00:01:23.360> is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
one of the challenges that we have is

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.810 
one of the challenges that we have is
that<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:24.409> are<00:01:24.439> tequila<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.189> process<00:01:25.640> but

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
that we are tequila in the process but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.760 
that we are tequila in the process but
not<00:01:25.970> from<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.330> region<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.080> what<00:01:27.290> that<00:01:27.470> means

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
not from the region and what that means

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.700 
not from the region and what that means
is<00:01:28.100> because<00:01:28.640> tequila<00:01:29.150> is<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.390> region<00:01:30.200> state<00:01:30.590> of

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
is because tequila is a region state of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.010 
is because tequila is a region state of
Jalisco<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.250> some<00:01:31.970> outskirts<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.750> state

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
Jalisco and some outskirts of the state

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.249 
Jalisco and some outskirts of the state
of<00:01:33.110> Jalisco<00:01:34.150> we've<00:01:35.150> had<00:01:35.299> some<00:01:35.509> challenges<00:01:35.540> but

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
of Jalisco we've had some challenges but

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.749 
of Jalisco we've had some challenges but
i<00:01:36.320> think<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.710> works<00:01:36.920> for<00:01:37.159> our<00:01:37.250> advantage

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
i think it's works for our advantage

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.940 
i think it's works for our advantage
there's<00:01:38.600> actually<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.439> more<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.860> a

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
there's actually it's more of a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.120 
there's actually it's more of a
conversation<00:01:40.130> piece<00:01:40.900> for<00:01:41.900> me<00:01:42.049> because<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:42.860> we

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
conversation piece for me because if we

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.550 
conversation piece for me because if we
were<00:01:43.220> just<00:01:43.430> another<00:01:43.700> tequila<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.049> think

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
were just another tequila you just think

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.960 
were just another tequila you just think
of<00:01:45.680> another<00:01:45.950> tequila<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:46.610> then<00:01:46.790> when<00:01:46.939> you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
of another tequila but then when you

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.760 
of another tequila but then when you
