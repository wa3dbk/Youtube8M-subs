00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
one particular way it's kind of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.000 
one particular way it's kind of
difficult<00:00:38.150> it's<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:39.410> see<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.710> from<00:00:39.860> another

difficult it's to see it from another
angle<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.780> know<00:00:41.780> I<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.530> know<00:00:42.560> I<00:00:42.649> grew<00:00:43.040> up<00:00:43.100> in<00:00:43.280> a

angle you know I you know I grew up in a

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.229 
angle you know I you know I grew up in a
period<00:00:43.579> where<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:46.100> music<00:00:46.460> was<00:00:46.489> just<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> most

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
period where the music was just the most

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.910 
period where the music was just the most
pristine<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:49.609> most<00:00:49.910> honest<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:53.920> clearly

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
pristine and the most honest and clearly

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.369 
pristine and the most honest and clearly
defined<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.789> I'm<00:00:56.329> not<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:56.660> saying<00:00:56.809> Hardy

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
defined and I'm not just saying Hardy

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.689 
defined and I'm not just saying Hardy
you<00:00:58.039> know<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.219> mean<00:00:58.609> rock<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.510> roll<00:00:59.690> was<00:01:00.699> rock

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
you know I mean rock and roll was rock

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.010 
you know I mean rock and roll was rock
and<00:01:01.879> roll<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:02.989> mean<00:01:03.910> put<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.059> way<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
and roll and I mean put the way you I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.360 
and roll and I mean put the way you I
think<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.860> largely<00:01:07.370> came<00:01:07.580> from<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.880> fact<00:01:08.120> that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
think it largely came from the fact that

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.160 
think it largely came from the fact that
every<00:01:10.370> group<00:01:11.380> work<00:01:12.380> together<00:01:13.900> every<00:01:14.900> band

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
every group work together every band

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.580 
every group work together every band
worked<00:01:15.800> together<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:17.030> know<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.480> it<00:01:17.630> took<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
worked together you know and it took the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.730 
worked together you know and it took the
complete<00:01:18.980> collective<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:20.270> make<00:01:20.420> one<00:01:20.740> except

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
complete collective to make one except

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.490 
complete collective to make one except
you<00:01:22.610> know<00:01:22.760> right<00:01:23.030> now<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.750> know<00:01:24.020> for<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.350> way

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
you know right now you know for the way

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.199 
you know I I can see the fruition of
what<00:04:00.230> my<00:04:00.320> dreams<00:04:00.590> were

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
what my dreams were

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.720 
what my dreams were
I<00:04:08.620> think<00:04:09.620> over<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:09.890> years<00:04:10.129> I've<00:04:10.370> managed<00:04:10.700> to

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
I think over the years I've managed to

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.399 
I think over the years I've managed to
develop<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.269> sound<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.780> never<00:04:11.840> really<00:04:12.260> paid

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
develop the sound I never really paid

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.580 
develop the sound I never really paid
attention<00:04:12.469> to<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.099> before<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:15.230> I've<00:04:15.409> been

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
attention to it before but I've been

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.499 
attention to it before but I've been
reminded<00:04:15.950> by<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.579> number<00:04:16.880> of<00:04:16.940> different<00:04:17.209> people
