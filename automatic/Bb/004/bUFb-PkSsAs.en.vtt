us about the perfect app absolutely Seth
the<00:00:16.980> perfect<00:00:17.310> app<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:17.720> important

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the perfect app is very important

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.300 
the perfect app is very important
because<00:00:18.960> there<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> lot<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> people<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
stress out of changing your headrest to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
stress out of changing your headrest to
make<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> make<00:00:31.560> sure<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> looks<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.309> factory<00:00:32.880> as

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
make it make sure it looks as factory as

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.530 
make it make sure it looks as factory as
possible<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:34.320> go<00:00:34.440> through<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> actually

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
possible we go through and actually

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
possible we go through and actually
manufacture<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> headrest<00:00:37.140> buns<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.770> foam

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
manufacture the headrest buns the foam

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.290 
manufacture the headrest buns the foam
inside<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> specific<00:00:40.500> post

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
inside we get the specific post

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
inside we get the specific post
dimensions<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.200> measurements<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.829> do

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
dimensions and the measurements and do

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
dimensions and the measurements and do
that<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.550> precisely<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.469> our

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that very precisely these are all in our

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
that very precisely these are all in our
machine<00:00:46.829> shop<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.640> actually<00:00:47.910> put<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.090> notches

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
machine shop we actually put the notches

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
machine shop we actually put the notches
in<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> factory<00:00:49.710> ones<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.280> they

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
in just like the factory ones so they

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.779 
in just like the factory ones so they
perfectly<00:00:51.059> match<00:00:51.289> now<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:53.129> stitching<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
perfectly match now the stitching is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
perfectly match now the stitching is
another<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.649> something

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
another thing that is really something

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.000 
another thing that is really something
that<00:00:56.550> somebody<00:00:57.090> will<00:00:57.210> notice<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.020> off<00:00:58.289> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that somebody will notice if it's off so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
that somebody will notice if it's off so
we<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.309> through<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.969> research<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.930> weight

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
we go through and we research the weight

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.100 
we go through and we research the weight
of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> thread<00:01:02.250> used<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.180> type<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> stitching

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of the thread used the type of stitching

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.260 
of the thread used the type of stitching
that<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.610> beyond<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.119> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that is on here and then beyond that we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
that is on here and then beyond that we
do<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.869> color<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.189> there's<00:01:08.369> also<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
do the color and then there's also the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
do the color and then there's also the
texture<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
texture on it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
texture on it
which<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> grain<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
which is like the you know the grain of

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
which is like the you know the grain of
the<00:01:13.020> leather<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> sheen

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the leather and then also the sheen

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.289 
the leather and then also the sheen
you'll<00:01:15.330> notice<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:16.340> Saturn<00:01:17.340> headrest<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you'll notice a Saturn headrest is a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
you'll notice a Saturn headrest is a
little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:18.960> different<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.590> Mercedes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
little bit different from a Mercedes

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.749 
little bit different from a Mercedes
headrest

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
headrest

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.570 
headrest
to<00:01:21.420> wear<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.900> has<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> different<00:01:22.380> texture<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to wear that has a different texture and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.789 
to wear that has a different texture and
Sheen<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.509> different<00:01:24.810> look<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.650> go

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
Sheen to it just a different look we go

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.940 
Sheen to it just a different look we go
out<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> match<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.939> perfectly<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
out and match that perfectly so there is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.550 
out and match that perfectly so there is
no<00:01:29.220> doubt<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.630> stock<00:01:31.079> headrest

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
no doubt that that is a stock headrest

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
no doubt that that is a stock headrest
but<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.610> rear<00:01:32.880> seat<00:01:33.060> entertainment<00:01:33.150> touch

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
but with rear seat entertainment touch

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
but with rear seat entertainment touch
so<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.560> sounds<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.799> there's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so it sounds like there's a lot of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.640 
so it sounds like there's a lot of
research<00:01:35.579> behind<00:01:35.880> making<00:01:36.810> sure<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.290> headrest

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
research behind making sure the headrest

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520 
research behind making sure the headrest
is<00:01:37.799> exactly<00:01:38.659> what<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> car<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
is exactly what is in the car that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
is exactly what is in the car that
matches<00:01:41.040> perfectly<00:01:41.119> tons<00:01:42.119> tons<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> research

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
matches perfectly tons tons of research

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.660 
matches perfectly tons tons of research
and<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.590> people<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.310> all<00:01:44.549> they

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and we have people that that's all they

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.030 
and we have people that that's all they
do<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> their<00:01:45.299> job<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.710> find<00:01:46.920> out

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
do that is their job we want we find out
