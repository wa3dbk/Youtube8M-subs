you<00:02:10.179> know<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:11.100> first<00:02:12.100> decide<00:02:12.340> blowing<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:12.730> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
you know I first decide blowing out a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.160 
you know I first decide blowing out a
candle<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:13.570> I'm<00:02:13.690> gonna<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:14.020> pretend

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
candle and then I'm gonna like pretend

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.200 
candle and then I'm gonna like pretend
like<00:02:14.500> I'm<00:02:14.650> sucking<00:02:14.890> through<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.160> straw<00:02:15.520> and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
like I'm sucking through a straw and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.240 
like I'm sucking through a straw and
that's<00:02:16.420> gonna<00:02:16.510> bring<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.840> gum<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.200> my<00:02:17.890> lips

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that's gonna bring the gum in my lips

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.920 
that's gonna bring the gum in my lips
instead<00:02:18.550> they<00:02:18.670> ended<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:19.030> all<00:02:19.330> over<00:02:19.360> my<00:02:19.660> face

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930

instead they ended up all over my face
which<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.740> easier<00:02:21.100> mess<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.490> clean<00:02:21.700> up

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
which is the easier mess to clean up

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.340 
which is the easier mess to clean up
when<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.210> just<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.570> your<00:02:22.720> lips<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.080> she<00:02:23.200> just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.510 
saw no if I were to blow the gum
I'd<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> pop<00:02:26.380> all<00:02:26.560> over<00:02:26.740> my<00:02:26.860> face<00:02:27.130> then

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520
