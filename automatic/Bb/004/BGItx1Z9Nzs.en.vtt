in Cheddar gold boxes these hinges

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060 
in Cheddar gold boxes these hinges
probably<00:00:18.130> be<00:00:18.330> almost<00:00:19.330> unbreakable<00:00:20.070> they're

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
probably be almost unbreakable they're

made out of high-strength steel the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.749 
made out of high-strength steel the
improvement<00:00:26.499> that<00:00:26.589> I<00:00:26.710> made<00:00:26.919> to<00:00:27.099> this<00:00:27.279> kid<00:00:27.550> is

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
improvement that I made to this kid is

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.120 
improvement that I made to this kid is
this<00:00:27.939> was<00:00:28.179> the<00:00:28.539> original<00:00:29.079> design<00:00:29.499> for<00:00:30.009> the

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
this was the original design for the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.150 
this was the original design for the
right<00:00:30.339> side<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:31.659> right<00:00:31.689> side<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.349> box<00:00:32.770> has

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
right side the right side of the box has

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.450 
right side the right side of the box has
a<00:00:33.220> shock<00:00:33.880> that<00:00:34.360> usually<00:00:35.050> causes<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.950> go<00:00:36.160> box

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
a shock that usually causes the go box

a shock that usually causes the go box
lid<00:00:37.210> hinge<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.840> break<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:40.180> with<00:00:40.510> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
lid hinge to break but with this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.880 
lid hinge to break but with this
original<00:00:41.860> design<00:00:42.040> there<00:00:42.760> was<00:00:42.940> no<00:00:43.240> way<00:00:43.450> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
original design there was no way to

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660 
original design there was no way to
attach<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.280> shock<00:00:45.550> mount<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:48.370> hinge

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
attach the shock mount to the hinge

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.660 
attach the shock mount to the hinge
where<00:00:49.000> it<00:00:49.120> would<00:00:49.240> need<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.450> be<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:50.680> I've<00:00:51.370> made

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
where it would need to be so I've made

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.030 
where it would need to be so I've made
some<00:00:51.970> improvements<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.440> is<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.890> new

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
some improvements and this is the new

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.390 
some improvements and this is the new
add<00:00:54.340> inch<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.650> little<00:00:56.950> bit<00:00:57.070> more

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
add inch it is a little bit more

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.000 
add inch it is a little bit more
difficult<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:57.940> install<00:00:58.360> but<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.590> will<00:00:59.800> give

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
difficult to install but it will give

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:10.380 
difficult to install but it will give
you<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.520> use<00:01:00.730> of<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.120> shock

to<00:01:34.910> take<00:01:35.120> us<00:01:35.360> one<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.810> screws<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.870> install

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
to take us one the screws and install

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.950 
to take us one the screws and install
them<00:01:39.020> out<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.700> new<00:01:40.850> hinge<00:01:43.660> should<00:01:44.660> be<00:01:44.780> real

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
them out to the new hinge should be real

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700 
them out to the new hinge should be real
easy<00:01:46.000> but<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.150> polycarbonate<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.410> going<00:01:48.650> to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
easy but the polycarbonate is going to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.120 
easy but the polycarbonate is going to
do<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> great<00:01:49.430> job<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.600> holding<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:53.000> mount<00:01:53.270> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
do a great job of holding the mount to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:09.529 
do a great job of holding the mount to
the<00:01:55.130> hinge

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.290 

there's<00:02:10.539> no<00:02:10.750> getting<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.230> off<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.060> want

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
there's no getting that off if you want

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.080 
there's no getting that off if you want
there's<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.720> spot<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> back<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.940> put

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
there's a spot in the back to put

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.490 
there's a spot in the back to put
another<00:02:16.390> screw<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.480> at<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.959> point<00:02:20.230> it's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
another screw but at this point it's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:32.340 
another screw but at this point it's
overkill<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:30.569> we're<00:02:31.569> going<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.750> why<00:02:31.900> install

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
overkill and we're going to why install

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.290 
overkill and we're going to why install
the<00:02:32.560> hinge<00:02:32.800> go<00:02:33.100> ahead<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.970> not<00:02:34.120> want

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
the hinge go ahead and you do not want

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.150 
the hinge go ahead and you do not want
to<00:02:34.450> install<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:35.080> until<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.830> lid<00:02:36.010> is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to install these until the lid is

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.890 
to install these until the lid is
already<00:02:36.520> on<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:40.630> for<00:02:40.840> the
