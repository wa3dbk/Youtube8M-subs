I<00:01:12.860> don't<00:01:13.220> know<00:01:13.310> hopefully<00:01:14.030> he<00:01:14.150> gets<00:01:14.299> it

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.730 
I don't know hopefully he gets it
together<00:01:14.600> later<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.380> year<00:01:15.470> when<00:01:15.619> it

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
together later in the year when it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.950 
together later in the year when it
really<00:01:15.979> matters<00:01:16.340> but<00:01:17.240> in<00:01:17.360> my<00:01:17.450> opinion<00:01:17.600> he

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
really matters but in my opinion he

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.520 
really matters but in my opinion he
hasn't<00:01:18.260> looked<00:01:18.439> great<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.369> start<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.790> season

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
hasn't looked great to start the season

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.780 
hasn't looked great to start the season
so<00:01:21.530> we'll<00:01:21.770> see<00:01:22.780> coming<00:01:23.780> up<00:01:24.020> if<00:01:24.740> he<00:01:24.799> looks

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
so we'll see coming up if he looks

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.940 
so we'll see coming up if he looks
better<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:26.210> let's<00:01:26.360> get<00:01:26.450> into<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.890> you

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950

is<00:04:00.859> 75<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:02.769> don't<00:04:03.769> know<00:04:03.859> why<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.040> went<00:04:04.280> over<00:04:04.489> power

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
is 75 I don't know why I went over power

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.809 
is 75 I don't know why I went over power
mode<00:04:04.909> that<00:04:05.060> doesn't<00:04:05.359> matter<00:04:05.479> injury<00:04:06.409> 97<00:04:07.190> 99

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
mode that doesn't matter injury 97 99

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.809 
mode that doesn't matter injury 97 99
stamina<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:08.479> that's<00:04:08.629> really<00:04:08.750> good<00:04:09.579> his<00:04:10.579> hip

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
stamina so that's really good his hip

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.699 
stamina so that's really good his hip
our<00:04:11.000> 75<00:04:11.629> so<00:04:11.870> I<00:04:11.900> guess<00:04:12.079> if<00:04:12.199> you<00:04:12.290> turn<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.560> ball

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
our 75 so I guess if you turn the ball

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.869 
our 75 so I guess if you turn the ball
over<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.099> you<00:04:13.159> can<00:04:13.250> get<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.370> hit<00:04:13.519> stick<00:04:13.729> with

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
over and you can get a hit stick with

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.170 
over and you can get a hit stick with
them<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.090> got<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.269> chance<00:04:14.479> for<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:15.260> fumble<00:04:15.680> there

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
them you got a chance for a fumble there

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.029 
them you got a chance for a fumble there
so<00:04:17.180> let's<00:04:17.389> go<00:04:17.539> over<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.019> other<00:04:18.199> new<00:04:18.560> halfback

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
so let's go over the other new halfback

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.310 
so let's go over the other new halfback
who<00:04:19.579> is<00:04:19.789> ridiculous<00:04:20.539> i<00:04:20.690> want<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.959> pick<00:04:21.049> him<00:04:21.199> up
