so let's start straight out and go with

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.480 
so let's start straight out and go with
some<00:00:25.980> point<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.400> bolt<00:00:26.550> lipos<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.269> 11.1<00:00:28.490> first

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
some point for bolt lipos to 11.1 first

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.650 
some point for bolt lipos to 11.1 first
off<00:00:29.699> 7<00:00:30.510> point<00:00:30.630> 4<00:00:30.840> volts<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.450> there

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
off 7 point 4 volts this is a big there

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.299 
off 7 point 4 volts this is a big there
now<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> lot<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> people<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> hear

now a lot of people are going to hear
7.4<00:00:36.030> ball<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> think<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.969> terribly

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
7.4 ball and think that is a terribly

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.799 
7.4 ball and think that is a terribly
bad<00:00:39.450> battery<00:00:40.020> out<00:00:40.230> slow<00:00:40.950> um<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.450> it's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
bad battery out slow um and it's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
bad battery out slow um and it's
actually<00:00:42.960> not<00:00:43.290> true<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.040> 7.4<00:00:44.670> volt<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.000> give

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
actually not true the 7.4 volt will give

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240 
actually not true the 7.4 volt will give
you<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> same<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.010> more

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
in a gun like this where basically the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.120 
in a gun like this where basically the
battery<00:01:17.369> compartment<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.060> here

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
battery compartment is right here

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
battery compartment is right here
seriously<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.520> sits<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.750> there

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
seriously it sits right about there

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
seriously it sits right about there
where<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.259> doesn't<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.590> any<00:01:22.740> space<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.009> even

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
where it doesn't have any space for even

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.600 
where it doesn't have any space for even
an<00:01:23.700> 8.4<00:01:24.180> volt<00:01:24.390> any<00:01:24.630> type<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.280> works<00:01:26.490> straight

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
an 8.4 volt any type this works straight

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.179

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.750 
which is why that one is lipo right so
again<00:03:39.599> 11.1<00:03:40.380> will<00:03:40.620> don't<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.280> any<00:03:41.430> higher<00:03:41.579> than

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
again 11.1 will don't go any higher than

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
again 11.1 will don't go any higher than
that<00:03:41.849> or<00:03:42.150> your<00:03:42.299> kill<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.780> basically

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
that or your kill it so that's basically

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
that or your kill it so that's basically
what's<00:03:46.230> up<00:03:46.349> with<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.530> 11.1<00:03:47.099> bolt<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.700> only

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
what's up with the 11.1 bolt the only

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360 
what's up with the 11.1 bolt the only
ones<00:03:48.120> really<00:03:48.419> like<00:03:48.840> already<00:03:49.079> r<00:03:49.319> KW<00:03:49.590> a's<00:03:49.889> in<00:03:50.190> the

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
it at all I'm sure as time goes by maybe

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.180 
it at all I'm sure as time goes by maybe
a<00:04:06.989> few<00:04:07.169> other<00:04:07.349> companies<00:04:07.709> will<00:04:07.829> be<00:04:07.859> ready<00:04:08.129> for

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
a few other companies will be ready for

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
but I honestly don't see that happening

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.869 
but I honestly don't see that happening
too<00:04:10.650> much<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.889> think<00:04:10.949> category<00:04:11.489> is<00:04:11.549> going<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.819> be

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
too much I think category is going to be

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.330 
too much I think category is going to be

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
regular charger don't do that that is

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.670 
regular charger don't do that that is

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
going to it that will later that will

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.290 
going to it that will later that will
light<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.010> on<00:04:40.160> fire<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.520> possibly<00:04:40.940> make<00:04:41.180> it

light this on fire and possibly make it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.810 
light this on fire and possibly make it
explode<00:04:41.600> what<00:04:42.169> you<00:04:42.290> need<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.710> do<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.520> use<00:04:43.790> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
explode what you need to do is use the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.870 
explode what you need to do is use the
BMS<00:04:44.479> that<00:04:44.750> will<00:04:45.020> come<00:04:45.229> with<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:46.190> BMS<00:04:46.610> and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
BMS that will come with it the BMS and

BMS that will come with it the BMS and
this<00:04:47.150> right<00:04:47.389> here<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:47.810> here's<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.050> PMS<00:04:48.440> there's

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
this right here so here's a PMS there's

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.800 
this right here so here's a PMS there's
just<00:04:49.400> an<00:04:49.550> example<00:04:49.669> there's<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:50.330> lot<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.600> other

ones that look different this is again

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.930 
ones that look different this is again
just<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.430> BMS<00:04:52.760> it<00:04:52.910> comes<00:04:53.030> with<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.180> stem<00:04:53.510> and

if you get the lipo and charger set with

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.719 
if you get the lipo and charger set with
kb<00:05:00.560> ways<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.889> will<00:05:00.979> come<00:05:01.100> with<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.250> BMS<00:05:01.550> and

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
kb ways it will come with a BMS and

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.750 
kb ways it will come with a BMS and
charter<00:05:02.120> but<00:05:02.570> this<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:02.810> what<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.139> AGM<00:05:03.560> stem<00:05:03.919> so

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.550 
charter but this is what the AGM stem so
here's<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.090> VMS<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.690> this<00:05:06.200> is<00:05:06.320> where<00:05:06.440> you

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
here's the VMS and this is where you

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.710 
here's the VMS and this is where you
plug<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.889> battery<00:05:06.919> in<00:05:07.250> use<00:05:07.820> this<00:05:08.090> extra

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
plug the battery in use this extra

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.250 
plug the battery in use this extra
different<00:05:09.380> attachment<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.990> plug<00:05:11.990> it<00:05:12.110> in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
different attachment and plug it in

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.510 
different attachment and plug it in
right<00:05:13.360> there<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.740> that's<00:05:15.740> how<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.010> charge<00:05:16.370> it

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
right there and that's how you charge it

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.120 
right there and that's how you charge it
now<00:05:17.180> this<00:05:17.389> one<00:05:17.539> this<00:05:17.870> particular<00:05:18.200> BMS<00:05:18.830> needs<00:05:19.070> a

now this one this particular BMS needs a

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.870 
now this one this particular BMS needs a
12<00:05:19.370> volt<00:05:19.520> charger<00:05:21.310> much<00:05:22.310> like<00:05:22.520> what<00:05:22.639> you<00:05:22.729> see

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
12 volt charger much like what you see

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520 
12 volt charger much like what you see

life and your laptop but it's kind of
the<00:05:28.039> ring<00:05:28.250> thing<00:05:28.550> as<00:05:28.729> you<00:05:28.820> can<00:05:28.940> see<00:05:29.150> make<00:05:29.840> sure

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
the ring thing as you can see make sure

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.840 
the ring thing as you can see make sure
it<00:05:30.139> doesn't<00:05:30.320> go<00:05:30.500> over<00:05:30.830> 12<00:05:31.130> volt<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.490> because<00:05:31.760> if

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
it doesn't go over 12 volt so because if

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.050 
it doesn't go over 12 volt so because if
it<00:05:31.940> does<00:05:32.060> he'll<00:05:32.180> kill<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.419> BMS<00:05:33.789> but<00:05:34.789> however

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
it does he'll kill the BMS but however

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.909 
it does he'll kill the BMS but however
if<00:05:35.360> you<00:05:35.450> get<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.660> lipo<00:05:35.990> set<00:05:36.530> with<00:05:37.340> KW<00:05:37.789> a's<00:05:38.919> you

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
if you get the lipo set with KW a's you

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.140 
if you get the lipo set with KW a's you
won't<00:05:40.070> need<00:05:40.160> a<00:05:40.220> charger<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.789> should<00:05:40.970> have<00:05:41.120> a

won't need a charger you should have a

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.460 
won't need a charger you should have a
12<00:05:41.389> volt<00:05:41.510> charger<00:05:41.690> laying<00:05:42.139> around<00:05:42.349> somewhere
