00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.870
 and such 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.060
 very welcome lounge to a new class 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.350
 of biblical Hebrew I am karim and today 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:33.010
 we are studying a new vowel of the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.079
 last class we saw the ay today we advance 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.000
 towards the e 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:45.050
 one of the in this first vowel is 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.960
 goal flame and in whatever name 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:54.579
 we can give the pronunciation yes 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.579
 with we wrote you with three points that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.010
 do you know what it looks like 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.360
 it looks like a bunch of grapes because well 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.369
 in arameo ségol it means cluster of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 grapes and that's how we wrote it 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.110
 so if we take as a model the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.549
 consonant meme because always the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.049
 vowels come after a consonant 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:26.799
 mmmm more 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.799
 ségol we pronounce m 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.930
 and as I said, this is not the only 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:37.400
 vocal that we have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.390
 there is also a vowel called cr 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.020
 they are pronounced the same but their writing and 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.700
 its use in grammar is totally 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 different 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.799
 the vowel cr are only two points 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:00.300
 below the consonant and again if 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:03.290
 we have the most cr 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.290
 we say 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.160
 but this is not the only one we can 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.840
 find there are also some combinations 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.510
 that we can use with killing lessons 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.489
 first of all we can combine with the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.510
 law this is only at the end of a 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.129
 word and let's pronounce 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.129
 once expired 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:44.020
 with the other combination with insurance 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:47.740
 plus one and I are going to pronounce him as 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:53.010
 the ox or law 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:56.370
 and back bunk we're obviously different 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.940
 and now we have to do our usual 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.130
 review in the text 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.680
 we have a 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.030
 a part of a very very verse 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.350
 known below some of the vowels 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.090
 back led and we will try to 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:22.690
 locate them in the text 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:29.480
 and we started from najas hai to arum nicole 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.569
 hyatt until yesterday until adonay elohim 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.040
 the vowels that we find in the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:42.930
 first word are a passage 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.379
 and 2 beds are now going to continue you 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.890
 with the rest of the vowels I hope that 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:52.850
 have learned enjoyed and see you 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.410
 in the next unit 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.410
