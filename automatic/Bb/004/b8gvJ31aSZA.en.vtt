00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
much it's exactly what happened with

lash format you know wine of wine of
wine<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.170> lineups<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.250> slowly<00:02:33.430> just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
wine of lineups and then it slowly just

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.599 
wine of lineups and then it slowly just
died<00:02:34.000> off<00:02:34.269> until<00:02:34.659> nobody<00:02:35.079> played<00:02:35.709> them<00:02:35.980> except

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
died off until nobody played them except

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.890 
died off until nobody played them except
for<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> couple<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:37.120> people<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.599> then

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
for a couple of people and then

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.920 
for a couple of people and then
eventually<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:40.510> really

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
eventually and and this is what really

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.039 
eventually and and this is what really
scares<00:02:41.319> me<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.790> everyone<00:02:42.790> stopped<00:02:43.299> siding<00:02:43.840> for

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
scares me is everyone stopped siding for

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.759 
scares me is everyone stopped siding for
them<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:44.890> they<00:02:45.010> end<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.640> winning<00:02:46.769> the

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
them and then they end up winning the

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.819 
them and then they end up winning the
Nationals<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.299> let's<00:02:49.870> hopefully<00:02:50.470> hopefully

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
Nationals so let's hopefully hopefully

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.770 
Nationals so let's hopefully hopefully
people<00:02:51.159> will<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.670> do<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.329> format

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
people will not do that this format

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.720 
people will not do that this format
hopefully<00:02:53.139> we<00:02:53.260> learned<00:02:53.530> from<00:02:54.010> last<00:02:54.220> format

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
hopefully we learned from last format

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.089 
hopefully we learned from last format
