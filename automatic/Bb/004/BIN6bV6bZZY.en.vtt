00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello friends welcome to the analysis of bring in and photo com 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.700
 today we are going to hoist the adidas cr7 boots 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.869
 those tennis 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.149
 as you can see, this is the model 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
 with high tippers 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.499
 flexibility of the boot 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 very low 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.810
 it costs quite a bit 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.810
 i the finish as I did is really good 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.880
 with material 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.440
 very hard against abrasion 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.090
 at the top phil protections taking advantage 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 the brand of the three 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520
 adidas dallas 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.309
 and in the part also front with very hard rubber 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.650
 and that they are going to help us protect ourselves from anyone 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.650
 impact of external elements 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 it should be noted 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.760
 the pleasures 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.100
 to iprem in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.020
 adidas 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 to resolve impacts in the rear area 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 part of the front 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 put this red material also 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550
 help sustain pacts 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.040
 the soles as you see tacos 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.040
 of medium or large span japan wingspan 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.120
 put us a ball 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.080
 large 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.170
 certainly good stability in this part 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.960
 while in the front 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.800
 it does not sound closer 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.690
 more directional 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 that way it will help us get better 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.710
 adidas spent system you have to bet on this model 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.980
 per system 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 dated fast 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.100
 that you do not have 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 very comfortable 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 with the detail 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.519
 well finished 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.659
 will help us for what 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.599
 the cord is not worth 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.969
 while we are walking 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.619
 inside 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.939
 as the gore says 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.939
 and quite a rival 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.679
 and likewise it comes down to it at all 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.459
 but yes 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.029
 it arrives quite up 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.609
 as for the template 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.779
 the simple template 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.849
 low profile 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.849
 Narrow without much material 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.719
 iztúris very well finished ordered with a unique posture on top 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.079
 of the sneakers 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.459
 no reflective for stays logically 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.259
 is a tapatía thought for 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.449
 the most extreme mountain 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:10.739
 even for 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.839
 be able to walk on snow 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.839
 min like any wet land that we will find 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.159
 apathy 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.779
 as well 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:26.319
 adidas has asked to think many lapses absorption of impacts have the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.769
 comfort 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.769
 for our walks 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.699
 adidas terrex disease 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.159
