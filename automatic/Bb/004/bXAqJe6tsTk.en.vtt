00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.500
 video data cross 00 then in this 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 video will explain how to uninstall the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.550
 system app 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
 so if for example we have an app that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 already pre-installed on our device 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.810
 android and we need nothing 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 with this tutorial we will learn a 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.790
 remove it without the device 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.130
 resents then we go to download 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 an application from the play store and this one 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:51.840
 application is called up system 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.770
 remover see this here then the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.770
 look to you 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.560
 here it is this one here with the symbol 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.920
 red basket here is the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.720
 install normally then when 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.430
 you have installed it go to open e 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.060
 you will come out of mine 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.650
 here here I have already selected here 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.660
 then with all the apps that are 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.190
 present in your device 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.910
 then what do you have to do for 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.140
 uninstall an app you will have to 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.860
 select it then I know I want 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.770
 uninstall calculator 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.180
 here it is either selected and you must 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.340
 put under uninstall here is here 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 asks stellar radiance that exists a little 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 the cheesemakers stability in the system 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.210
 continue with the selected apps 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.850
 in short, it tells you that it practically exists 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.770
 a calculator year you won't have one anymore 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.300
 calculator in your device e 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.440
 so this will affect the operation 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.800
 of the system 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.200
 in the sense that you can no longer do i 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.119
 calculations in your mobile 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 I put no because I don't want to 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.479
 uninstall it because I need it though 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.630
 you put 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.320
 yes if you want to uninstall it and it will start 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.560
 the installation procedure and then 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.840
 at the end it will be uninstalled and the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 your device will not be affected 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.490
 very short, except for this one 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.860
 little lack for which you will not be able 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.340
 do the calculations and in your device 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.620
 your device then see here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.569
 where is written up system here here 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.980
 there is a menu so we open it see here 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.300
 there are options 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.520
 the system manager then are up 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.310
 these which we have seen before 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.460
 all the apps will then be those that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.800
 we installed from the play store 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.800
 exposed in the sd card is to move the apps 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 in the sd card shown in the phone e 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.490
 move applications from sd cards 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.590
 on the phone apk less 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.750
 to see the apks you have installed 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.340
 your device if you have it 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.830
 installed and then options 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.380
 so broken help would be a 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.950
 explanation of what is broken and how to do it 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.290
