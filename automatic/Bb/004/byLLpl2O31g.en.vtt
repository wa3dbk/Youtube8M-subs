00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.809
 we can open files using the 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.819
 programs that are anchored in the bar 

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:09.129
 of tasks this will be useful when a 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.740
 file is related to another program 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.629
 and we want to open it with a 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.120
 second because in case the only 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.160
 program that can open it is the same 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.039
 from the taskbar does not help 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.720
 use this technique with just double 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.179
 click on the file is going to open the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.230
 program I'm going to go into a folder that 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:32.620
 contain images that is precisely the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.370
 library of my images here I have 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.630
 some images are mostly png and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 psd but for example jpg images 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.580
 the program that is the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.280
 photo viewer I will double 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.760
 click on it and see how the 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.920
 Photo viewer has opened this 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.350
 is the default application that 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.600
 has windows let's say the one I like 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.030
 to see this type of files but it 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.890
 I happened to make some changes in a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.229
 different program for example photoshop 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.270
 obvious you can open photoshop and then 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.189
 open the image in it from 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.399
 the open option that has the least file 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.469
 but it will be easier to drag it to the 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.990
 taskbar where I currently have 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.119
 a photoshop shortcut is this 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.350
 icon that you are seeing here I showed you 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.390
 in a previous video that the drag 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.159
 files directly on the icons 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.189
 that are in the taskbar 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.280
 what we are going to do is anchor said 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.709
 file in the jump list for example 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.829
 I'm going to select the image and I'm going to 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:39.189
 drag to the photoshop icon and 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.439
 we see how the phrase anchors to 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.349
 photoshop if I loose what will happen 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.200
 is what we are seeing has been anchored 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:49.360
 the shortcut really do not want 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.329
 What happens is that what I want is that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.520
 drop the image opens photoshop to 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.709
 same time that opens this image what 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.630
 let's do then is exactly what 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.289
 same but in this case we're going to keep 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.270
 pressed the shift key or uppercase and 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.450
 we see how the phrase changes now says 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.459
 open with and a + sign appears there 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.859
 when we are going to release the mouse button 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.340
 and it will automatically open the 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.530
 program at the same time it opens the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.870
 in this way we can start 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.170
 work with it and so easy is like 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.330
 we can open files with programs that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 They are anchored in the taskbar
