00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
there it'd be better than just having a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.410 
there it'd be better than just having a
plain<00:02:28.950> old<00:02:28.980> campfire<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.819> it'd<00:02:29.879> be<00:02:30.000> safer

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420

because<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.810> contain<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> fire<00:02:31.410> better

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299
