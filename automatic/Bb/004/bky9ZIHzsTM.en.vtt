 behind this plate a motor with a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.739

 with all these positioning woods that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:51.420
 is no more than an axis that an axis connected to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.420
 cables that comes up the plateau 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.420
 by lateral guidance 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 here is this plateau not allow us to 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.209
 mount the fire at discretion to have the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:20.560
 ideal temperature at the level of the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:24.090
