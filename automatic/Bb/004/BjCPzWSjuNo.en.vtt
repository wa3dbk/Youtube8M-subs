00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.270
 being slow constant but that very 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.639
 well that you have an excellent day and 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.080
 all those beautiful things that I like about 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 that year so I should not do this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 kind of videos because their parents are going to 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 hate because they have a dad likes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 know that your children get drunk 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.539
 every Friday or fit and well either 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.330
 I'm telling you that you should feel 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.039
 proud to wear dogs every click 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.690
 weekend because definitely not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.300
 it's something that we have to 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.520
 feel proud but they are not bad either 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.199
 let's analyze it, do not be 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 drunk makes our lives easier and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.649
 I'm going to tell you because first of all 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.210
 honesty today we live in a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
 era in which sincerity is not 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.840
 our greatest virtue, on the contrary, knows 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.149
 to we meet super people 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.649
 liars that are not worth it and it's a 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.090
 little by little we are destroying the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 heart today we can not trust 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.280
 fully in any person at all 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.079
 person is more we can not trust 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.000
 our partner nor at our best 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 friends this bad we are today 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
 but we ride dangerous when we are 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 drunk or when we are in the state 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 to be drunk we are the most 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 more sincere of the world which we 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.789
 makes a lot more people 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.789
 valuable because 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.380
 and it is that when we are drunk we are 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.240
 fully honest and we say to the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.789
 people the truth no matter how 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.829
 Culera be that truth to people who 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.299
 we love we tell you that hands to 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.280
 We hate people who tell them that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 hates more if they ask you something are you going to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 tell the truth to the egg and that's a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 advantage because honesty is a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 advantage 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.610
 on the other hand we gain value and we 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 it's worth it and ok to be honest 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.729
 as I said in the previous point but 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.520
 another very different is to have the eggs 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.069
 for you to say something say or do 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.270
 things that you want or that you do not dare to 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.890
 say when you're on it for example 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.750
 is the china that you like the girl that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.399
 you always liked that woman 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.720
 with which you dream and with which you think 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.580
 all day 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.770
 how many drunk do you have the value of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.270
 to arrive and tell everything everything that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 you feel and everything you've wanted to say 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.039
 more news and no click efe 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 ok that does not assure you that she's going to 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.729
 correspond in fact I do not think that you 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.590
 go to correspond years that she 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 she is also just as drunk 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.239
 I do not believe and maybe you're like a 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.060
 asshole with her but inside you go to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.530
 have a normal satisfaction goes to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.910
 be an incredible satisfaction of 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.319
 to have told him everything that always 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 you had wanted to say in a few words 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.120
 in any situation we dare to 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.549
 say what we do not dare when 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 We are sober is an advantage too 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.150
 we have a sense of humor to all of us 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.650
 like to meet a person with a good 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
 sense of humor to the personal area 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.440
 canada then and when are you but you laugh 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.959
 chingo a shit for the same thing you're more 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.819
 shit and people can love you you can 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.220
 make friends and everyone can do 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.870
 laughing together down there has no sense of what 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.880
 who are laughing are a fucking ball of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.680
 assholes herria not be human but we 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.290
 can help socialize and have fun 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.750
 A little bit I explain myself love reading 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.849
 place a magazine I do not remember that they were 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.010

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.690
 does very well in your life and in your body 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.640
 therefore laughing at this file is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.440
 good for your health analyzing never 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.480
 You thought that being drunk was going to be so 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.519
 good but that's why I'm here for 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.519
 guide you on the right path or maybe not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.660
 but what you forget about all your 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.550
 problems let's assume that you study or 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.980
 you work this type of activities 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.810
 they always bring you problems always 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.850
 they have problems in your life if you study 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.100
 your problem would be that you're going to try it and 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.990
 you work, we return, it would be that I do not know your 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.520
 Boss hates you because he 's a fool 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.070
 or maybe you have problems with your girlfriend 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.890
 of partner than other dads with your best 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.600
 friend and it does not matter what matters is that 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.730
 when you are drunk all the 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 problems you forget so it is 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.360
 a great time you can enjoy the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.040
 life and feel that you eat the world to 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.020

 enjoy those moments of life in the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.980
 that there are no stones in the way 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.690
 and everything is fine, you forget about 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.880
 all the problems of analyzing it when 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.070
 you have the opportunity to forget about 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.940
 all the problems apart from each 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.520
 Friday and every Saturday that is clicked end 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.020
