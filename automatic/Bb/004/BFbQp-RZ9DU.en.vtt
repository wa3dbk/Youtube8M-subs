00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
can see that here I like doing this this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.279 
can see that here I like doing this this
is<00:00:35.450> fun<00:00:36.820> today<00:00:37.820> we're<00:00:38.149> gonna<00:00:38.300> swap<00:00:38.629> out<00:00:38.930> for

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
is fun today we're gonna swap out for

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.479 
is fun today we're gonna swap out for
the<00:00:39.739> go<00:00:39.980> fast<00:00:40.340> bits<00:00:41.170> blow-off<00:00:42.170> valve<00:00:42.559> now<00:00:43.100> they

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
the go fast bits blow-off valve now they

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.639 
the go fast bits blow-off valve now they
actually<00:00:43.670> have<00:00:43.850> two<00:00:44.450> different<00:00:44.840> options<00:00:44.989> the

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
actually have two different options the

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.830 
actually have two different options the
turbo<00:00:45.890> smart<00:00:46.039> one<00:00:46.219> we<00:00:46.340> reviewed<00:00:46.760> is<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.480> dual

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
turbo smart one we reviewed is a dual

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.620 
turbo smart one we reviewed is a dual
port<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:48.920> both<00:00:49.070> recirculating<00:00:49.880> and<00:00:50.030> vent

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
port so it's both recirculating and vent

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.740 
port so it's both recirculating and vent
atmosphere<00:00:51.170> style<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.910> go-fast<00:00:53.270> bits<00:00:53.570> which

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
atmosphere style the go-fast bits which

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.280 
atmosphere style the go-fast bits which
is<00:00:53.780> in<00:00:54.079> my<00:00:54.350> car<00:00:54.590> now<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.910> dual<00:00:56.540> port<00:00:56.870> version

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
is in my car now is a dual port version

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.080 
is in my car now is a dual port version
so<00:00:57.860> we'll<00:00:58.130> take<00:00:58.310> that<00:00:58.460> around<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.880> street

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
so we'll take that around the street

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.430 
so we'll take that around the street
here<00:00:59.270> so<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.450> can<00:00:59.540> kind<00:00:59.660> of<00:00:59.780> get<00:00:59.989> some<00:01:00.140> sound

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
here so you can kind of get some sound

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.190 
here so you can kind of get some sound
clips<00:01:00.590> on<00:01:00.860> that<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:01.880> they<00:01:02.030> also<00:01:02.239> do<00:01:02.690> offer<00:01:02.960> a

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
clips on that but they also do offer a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.789 
clips on that but they also do offer a
fully<00:01:03.649> recirculating<00:01:04.489> shown<00:01:05.210> here<00:01:05.840> which<00:01:06.590> is

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
fully recirculating shown here which is

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.690 
fully recirculating shown here which is
basically<00:01:07.340> identical<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.750> factory<00:01:09.170> setup

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
basically identical to the factory setup

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.389 
basically identical to the factory setup
so<00:01:10.960> this<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.140> an<00:01:12.259> option<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.770> guys<00:01:12.950> who<00:01:13.189> aren't

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
so this is an option for guys who aren't

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.209 
so this is an option for guys who aren't
looking<00:01:13.850> for<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.509> most<00:01:14.659> show-off<00:01:15.079> of<00:01:15.380> sounds

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
looking for the most show-off of sounds

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.800 
looking for the most show-off of sounds
they<00:01:16.880> want<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.149> be<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> little<00:01:17.450> bit<00:01:17.570> more

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
they want to be a little bit more

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.940 
they want to be a little bit more
stealth<00:01:18.880> maybe<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.409> woosh<00:01:21.409> sound<00:01:21.439> isn't

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
stealth maybe the woosh sound isn't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.319 
stealth maybe the woosh sound isn't
their<00:01:22.249> thing<00:01:22.520> which<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.850> completely

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
their thing which is completely

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.870 
their thing which is completely
understandable<00:01:23.889> so<00:01:24.889> they<00:01:25.039> do<00:01:25.100> offer<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.609> fully

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
understandable so they do offer a fully

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.849 
understandable so they do offer a fully
recirculated<00:01:26.509> version<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.259> this<00:01:27.499> one's<00:01:27.709> going

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
recirculated version so this one's going

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.620 
recirculated version so this one's going
to<00:01:27.950> be<00:01:28.159> on<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.579> stock<00:01:28.999> airbox

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
to be on a stock airbox

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.199 
to be on a stock airbox
pretty<00:01:30.079> much<00:01:30.319> quiet<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.759> won't<00:01:31.969> be<00:01:32.060> any

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
pretty much quiet and won't be any

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.120 
pretty much quiet and won't be any
different<00:01:32.719> sounding<00:01:33.259> than<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.679> factory

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
different sounding than the factory

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.789 
different sounding than the factory
blow-off<00:01:34.429> valve<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:35.899> do<00:01:36.079> have<00:01:36.319> an<00:01:36.529> intake

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
blow-off valve if you do have an intake

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.769 
blow-off valve if you do have an intake
on<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.159> car<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:37.700> obviously<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.569> going

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:38.779 
on the car then obviously this is going

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.239 
on the car then obviously this is going
to<00:01:38.869> be<00:01:38.959> a<00:01:38.990> little<00:01:39.139> bit<00:01:39.289> more<00:01:39.409> audible<00:01:39.889> and

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
to be a little bit more audible and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.010 
to be a little bit more audible and
maybe<00:01:40.850> we'll<00:01:41.060> get<00:01:41.149> some<00:01:41.329> sound<00:01:41.569> clips<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.899> this

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
maybe we'll get some sound clips of this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.449 
maybe we'll get some sound clips of this
when<00:01:42.170> we<00:01:42.200> get<00:01:42.350> an<00:01:42.469> intake<00:01:42.709> on<00:01:42.889> the<00:01:42.979> vehicle<00:01:43.340> but

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
when we get an intake on the vehicle but

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.519 
when we get an intake on the vehicle but
for<00:01:43.670> now<00:01:43.759> I've<00:01:43.999> got<00:01:44.179> the<00:01:44.299> dual<00:01:44.479> port<00:01:44.749> Gulf<00:01:45.349> at

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:45.529 
for now I've got the dual port Gulf at

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.289 
for now I've got the dual port Gulf at
spits<00:01:45.770> on<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.249> we'll<00:01:46.340> take<00:01:46.789> for<00:01:46.999> a<00:01:47.029> spin<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
spits on and we'll take for a spin and

00:01:47.299 --> 00:02:28.470 
spits on and we'll take for a spin and
see<00:01:47.659> what<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:47.990> think

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.540
