well I think it's just one man's dream
kind<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.430> people<00:00:47.730> say<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
kind of thing you know people say that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.299 
kind of thing you know people say that
you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.870> my<00:00:49.020> dream<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you know this is my dream and I want to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
you know this is my dream and I want to
do<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.879> how<00:00:51.239> many<00:00:51.420> people<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:51.780> live<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
do and how many people actually live it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
do and how many people actually live it
and<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:53.730> Shah<00:00:54.000> Rukh<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.239> one

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and do it and I think Shah Rukh is one

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.299 
and do it and I think Shah Rukh is one
of<00:00:54.539> them

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
of them

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
of them
I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.820> he's<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.090> taken<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> another

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
I think he's just taken it to another

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.510 
I think he's just taken it to another
level<00:00:59.210> when<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> doors<00:01:00.719> open<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> fact

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
level when the doors open just the fact

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.719 
level when the doors open just the fact
of<00:01:03.049> having<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.589> lived<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.250> whole<00:01:05.460> thing

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
of having to have lived this whole thing

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
of having to have lived this whole thing
and<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:06.600> built<00:01:07.560> therefore<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and actually built therefore like you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.910 
and actually built therefore like you
know<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.580> two<00:01:08.790> hundred<00:01:09.090> days<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.770> make<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
