we have a branch which has been damaged
you<00:00:27.710> can<00:00:27.919> see<00:00:28.189> that<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:28.609> bark<00:00:28.999> has<00:00:29.359> peeled

you can see that the bark has peeled

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.530 
you can see that the bark has peeled
away<00:00:30.289> from<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.769> sub<00:00:31.039> wood<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:32.119> entire

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
is called a collared Union you can see

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.010 
is called a collared Union you can see
the<00:00:45.770> bark<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.220> tree<00:00:46.510> poops<00:00:47.510> out<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.840> little

the bark of the tree poops out a little

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.010 
the bark of the tree poops out a little
bit<00:00:48.380> as<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:49.430> limb<00:00:49.700> comes<00:00:50.120> out<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.690> tree

bit as the limb comes out of the tree
this<00:00:51.890> part<00:00:52.250> here<00:00:52.700> is<00:00:52.820> called<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.390> collar<00:00:53.660> and

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
this part here is called the collar and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.180 
this part here is called the collar and
this<00:00:54.770> is<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.250> branch<00:00:55.550> all<00:00:56.510> cuts<00:00:57.350> at<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.710> Collard

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
this is the branch all cuts at a Collard

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.000 
this is the branch all cuts at a Collard
Union<00:00:58.580> should<00:00:59.030> be<00:00:59.210> on<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.690> branch<00:01:00.050> side<00:01:00.770> of

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
Union should be on the branch side of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.790 
Union should be on the branch side of
the<00:01:01.100> collar<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:01.670> never<00:01:02.210> ever<00:01:02.600> cut<00:01:03.230> into<00:01:03.680> the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the collar you never ever cut into the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.550 
the collar you never ever cut into the
collar<00:01:04.070> of<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.640> tree<00:01:04.939> if<00:01:05.119> this<00:01:05.869> branch<00:01:06.200> was

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
collar of a tree if this branch was

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.859 
collar of a tree if this branch was
smaller<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.280> could<00:01:07.520> use<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.820> pair<00:01:08.240> of<00:01:08.270> anvil

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
smaller we could use a pair of anvil

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.529 
smaller we could use a pair of anvil
blockers<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:10.189> cut<00:01:10.429> it<00:01:10.549> outside<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.270> collar

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
blockers to cut it outside of the collar

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.590 
blockers to cut it outside of the collar
but<00:01:11.960> since<00:01:12.200> it's<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.439> large<00:01:12.829> our<00:01:13.299> anvils<00:01:14.299> will

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
but since it's so large our anvils will

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.169 
but since it's so large our anvils will
not<00:01:14.840> properly<00:01:15.380> cut<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.219> for<00:01:16.579> this<00:01:16.700> cut<00:01:16.939> we're

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
not properly cut so for this cut we're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.029 
not properly cut so for this cut we're
going<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.359> use<00:01:17.569> the<00:01:17.719> next<00:01:17.929> best<00:01:18.109> thing<00:01:18.289> and<00:01:18.649> I

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
going to use the next best thing and I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.980 
going to use the next best thing and I
have<00:01:19.219> a<00:01:19.249> bow<00:01:19.609> saw<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.270> we're<00:01:20.450> going<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.749> use

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
have a bow saw that we're going to use

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.730 
have a bow saw that we're going to use
now<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.969> proper<00:01:23.390> way<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.630> use<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.049> bow<00:01:24.319> saw<00:01:24.560> to

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
now the proper way to use a bow saw to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.499 
now the proper way to use a bow saw to
cut<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.979> limb<00:01:25.249> off<00:01:25.399> of<00:01:25.579> a<00:01:25.670> tree<00:01:25.939> is<00:01:26.149> to<00:01:26.359> make

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
cut a limb off of a tree is to make

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.819 
cut a limb off of a tree is to make
three<00:01:26.929> distinct<00:01:27.649> cuts<00:01:28.009> if<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.319> use<00:01:30.590> the

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
three distinct cuts if you just use the

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.760 
three distinct cuts if you just use the
saw<00:01:31.069> and<00:01:31.429> cut<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.240> at<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.479> collar<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.530> weight

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
saw and cut it at the collar the weight

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.590 
saw and cut it at the collar the weight
of<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.069> branch<00:01:34.340> would<00:01:34.639> pull<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.999> down<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.539> you

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
of the branch would pull it down and you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.279 
of the branch would pull it down and you
would<00:01:36.049> risk<00:01:36.439> tearing<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.939> collar<00:01:38.289> damaging

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
would risk tearing the collar damaging

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.469 
would risk tearing the collar damaging
the<00:01:39.409> tree<00:01:39.679> so<00:01:40.069> we<00:01:40.249> want<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.549> use<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.729> three<00:01:41.240> cut

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
the tree so we want to use a three cut

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.239 
the tree so we want to use a three cut
method<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:42.200> first<00:01:42.469> cut<00:01:42.740> will<00:01:42.889> be<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
method the first cut will be on the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.279 
method the first cut will be on the
underside<00:01:43.429> and<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.600> will<00:01:44.719> be<00:01:44.869> about<00:01:45.229> five

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
underside and it will be about five

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.940 
underside and it will be about five
inches<00:01:46.219> away<00:01:46.459> from<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.209> collar<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:47.810> cut<00:01:48.799> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
inches away from the collar you cut the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.430 
inches away from the collar you cut the
branch<00:01:49.219> about<00:01:49.700> 1/4<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.959> way<00:01:51.109> through
