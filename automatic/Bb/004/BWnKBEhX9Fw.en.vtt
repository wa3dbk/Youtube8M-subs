00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.590
 and very good to all people with montanier 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:11.630
 I hope you are very well today we are in 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:14.900
 Minecraft version 1.749 I'll 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.550
 I will teach how to make a giant zombies 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.390
 in this version only 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.140
 but it really looks great and a dad 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.420
 fact 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.539
 I do not know where I am 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.930
 he escaped the damn 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.180
 but hey it really easy 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.070
 to do it we just need to put this 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.790
 command that I'll leave it in the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.270
 description 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 is 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.760
 is this sum with double m 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.570
 already there is giant or with gem in the zombie 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.580
 with double and then we put the command and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.590
 suddenly this appears only that it is a 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.430
 little dangerous since if you're in your 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.650
 computer is possible that is going to hit you 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.050
 and purple right now we are going to try it in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.760
 survival for while going to try 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:15.120
 kill these things because I despair 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.120
 and well then the version 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.680
 one 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 with a bow 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.670
 drink 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.860
 and that 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.710
 it is assumed that men must die 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.229
 with headsets but pressure in this 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.040
 version to does not make any sense 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 none seriously seriously I the one 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.070
 I have 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.020
 they also expect that they have a delay 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.420
 Leave it alone, poor baby, there's a chicken 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.530
 this more important than the zombie will take 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.190
 take shots 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.190
 and that's it 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.079
 and that's it 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.439
 we finish that gives us experience and meat 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.439
 rotten 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.650
 what more rolled the rotten meat 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.250
 what rays have released arrows 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.250
 so 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180
 okay 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.470
 what the hell are there like two arrows 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.260
 well let's follow then now we get 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.370
 the survival 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.579
 but and we put the command for them 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:43.970
 they are important and they will see that 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:43.970
 let's die when putting that command 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.130
 we see well 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.190
 but if the zombie does not hit you, look at it 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.460
 there is 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 to kings with note with arrows to be already 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:03.950
 it does not matter it does not matter 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.650
 not about 1000 and a half 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.520
 or led and from here I have the best 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.520
 aim of the world 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:19.640
 Yanez from here is going to die already 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.680
 what the hell can be true that three 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.680
 countries are capable 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.520
 tomÃ¡s 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.810
 take indigestion 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.430
 a show 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.439
 with that 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.140
 in neither house nor I think that's 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:45.530
 my zombie friend but do not die in 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.160
 Serious , I want to prove your prowess to see 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:56.540
 do not die I just want to make friends 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:59.650
 I want to be your friend, they are my fool 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.829
 or want to give a hug 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.829
 one and hug me and hold me 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:16.240
 and if nice with everything will return for the 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.240
 camera had to take the photos 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.370
 that flips you over 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.030
 to bring you see that I will not do anything 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.690
 photogenic 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.690
 cows 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.259

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.020

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.479

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.900
 Well, they saw that money very fast 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.379
 what happens if he invoked it from a place 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.379
 high 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.610
 let's go for blocks 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.599

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.599
 up above 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.330

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:11.810

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.290

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.420

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:15.460
 me 234 that ray with water looks 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.460
 it is also not true it will be a bug 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:27.220
 rays I'll do an ethical roller coaster for 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.900
 the next episode of minecraft and 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.710

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.310

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.449
 Well, from here we're going to release the sumo 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.840
 zombie 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:48.840

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:20.109
 what I expected from here not 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:23.019
 dies but the one above and that's the 

00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:25.379
 second the third zombie disappeared from 

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.379
 the nothing 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:31.169

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:53.750
 but the radio is written 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.250
 does not make much sense but good until 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.250
