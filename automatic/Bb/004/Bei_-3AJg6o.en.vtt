video<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.140> rotation<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.890> damage<00:00:50.190> meter<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
video with rotation and damage meter to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.950 
video with rotation and damage meter to
check<00:00:50.610> where<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.210> damaged<00:00:51.480> grows<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
check where your damaged grows and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
check where your damaged grows and
stabilizes<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> never<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
stabilizes as with me it never really is

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
stabilizes as with me it never really is
stable<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.460> seems<00:00:56.789> like

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
stable so basically it just seems like

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
stable so basically it just seems like
you<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.180> me<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.390> show<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.870> rotation<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you want me to show the rotation in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.099 
you want me to show the rotation in
practice<00:00:59.340> rather<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.969> an<00:01:00.480> explanation<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
practice rather than an explanation of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
practice rather than an explanation of
the<00:01:01.199> rotation<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> where

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the rotation so that you can see where

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
the rotation so that you can see where
my<00:01:02.940> damage<00:01:03.270> grows<00:01:03.570> where<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> stabilizes<00:01:04.680> them

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
my damage grows where it stabilizes them

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.910 
my damage grows where it stabilizes them
such<00:01:05.040> um<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:06.540> can't<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.770> this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
such um I can't really see this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.520 
such um I can't really see this
happening<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> target<00:01:08.729> dummy<00:01:09.060> because

rest of the range dps and I'm you really
used<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.910> being<00:02:27.090> top<00:02:27.300> two<00:02:27.890> okay<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:28.950> basically

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
used to being top two okay so basically

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.880 
used to being top two okay so basically
choked<00:02:30.180> l<00:02:30.360> isn't<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> best<00:02:31.380> fight<00:02:31.680> for

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
choked l isn't really the best fight for

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.070 
choked l isn't really the best fight for
destruction<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.630> had<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> choose<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
destruction if I had to choose a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470 
destruction if I had to choose a
warlocks<00:02:34.620> back<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.670> fight<00:02:35.940> destruction

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
warlocks back for that fight destruction

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.020 
warlocks back for that fight destruction
would<00:02:36.600> still<00:02:36.930> probably<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.280> best<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:38.730> so

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
would still probably be the best one so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.830 
would still probably be the best one so
far<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:40.050> now<00:02:40.200> anyway<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.690> how<00:02:42.810> you

far right now anyway I can see how you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.480 
far right now anyway I can see how you
might<00:02:42.960> fall<00:02:43.380> behind<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> damage<00:02:44.130> meters

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
terms of DPS like I think a function

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.129 
terms of DPS like I think a function
isn't<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.650> very<00:04:59.800> good<00:04:59.919> place<00:05:00.310> right<00:05:00.460> now<00:05:00.580> um<00:05:01.139> I

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
isn't a very good place right now um I

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.040 
isn't a very good place right now um I
mean<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.010> could<00:05:03.220> use<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> small<00:05:03.880> boost<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.300> DPS<00:05:04.750> I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
mean it could use a small boost in DPS I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.500 
mean it could use a small boost in DPS I
guess<00:05:05.410> I<00:05:05.770> don't<00:05:06.520> really<00:05:06.639> think<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:07.000> needs<00:05:07.300> it

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
guess I don't really think it needs it

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.170 
guess I don't really think it needs it
but<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.979> mean<00:05:09.160> Blizzard<00:05:09.520> seems<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:09.910> think<00:05:10.090> it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
but I mean Blizzard seems to think it

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.320 
but I mean Blizzard seems to think it
does<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:11.289> that's<00:05:12.250> what's<00:05:12.520> going<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.270> be

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
does so that's what's going to be

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.029 
does so that's what's going to be
happening<00:05:13.360> in<00:05:13.750> 4.1<00:05:14.229> apparently<00:05:14.800> there's<00:05:14.950> a

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
happening in 4.1 apparently there's a

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.980 
happening in 4.1 apparently there's a
couple<00:05:15.250> bucks<00:05:15.520> or<00:05:15.760> affliction<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.419> far<00:05:16.660> there

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
couple bucks or affliction so far there

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.350 
couple bucks or affliction so far there
might<00:05:17.139> be<00:05:17.169> more<00:05:17.410> there<00:05:17.680> may<00:05:17.919> not<00:05:17.979> be<00:05:18.099> I<00:05:18.460> don't

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
might be more there may not be I don't

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.469 
might be more there may not be I don't
really<00:05:19.510> know<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:19.990> honest<00:05:21.120> like<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.240> said<00:05:22.419> I

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
really know to be honest like I said I

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.180 
really know to be honest like I said I
don't<00:05:22.570> really<00:05:22.840> think<00:05:22.960> it's<00:05:23.169> necessary<00:05:23.229> uh<00:05:23.800> I

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
don't really think it's necessary uh I

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.830 
don't really think it's necessary uh I
would<00:05:24.370> rather<00:05:24.639> just<00:05:24.970> see<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> couple<00:05:25.419> smaller

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
would rather just see a couple smaller

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.800 
would rather just see a couple smaller
changes<00:05:26.169> made<00:05:26.470> instead<00:05:26.860> for<00:05:27.849> instance<00:05:28.150> not<00:05:28.690> to

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
changes made instead for instance not to

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.110 
changes made instead for instance not to
go<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.050> long<00:05:29.200> rant<00:05:29.470> here<00:05:29.620> but<00:05:30.099> I'd<00:05:30.490> like<00:05:30.820> bane

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
go on a long rant here but I'd like bane

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.969 
go on a long rant here but I'd like bane
of<00:05:31.270> agony<00:05:31.599> to<00:05:31.750> be<00:05:31.840> completely<00:05:32.229> superior<00:05:32.800> to

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
of agony to be completely superior to

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.310 
of agony to be completely superior to
bed<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.250> doom<00:05:33.430> for<00:05:33.729> affliction<00:05:34.180> at<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.050> moment

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
bed of doom for affliction at the moment

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.420 
bed of doom for affliction at the moment
we're<00:05:35.410> kind<00:05:35.590> of<00:05:35.620> switching<00:05:35.889> around<00:05:36.099> between

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
we're kind of switching around between

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.100 
we're kind of switching around between
using<00:05:36.820> one<00:05:36.970> or<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.210> other<00:05:37.240> depending<00:05:37.660> on<00:05:38.020> the

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
using one or the other depending on the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.170 
using one or the other depending on the
encounter<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:39.580> don't<00:05:39.880> think<00:05:40.060> that's

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
encounter and I just don't think that's

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.110 
encounter and I just don't think that's
what<00:05:40.300> Blizzard<00:05:40.750> really<00:05:40.990> intended<00:05:41.910> the<00:05:42.910> only

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
what Blizzard really intended the only

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.700 
what Blizzard really intended the only
other<00:05:43.240> thing<00:05:43.419> that<00:05:43.630> I'd<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.320> comes<00:05:44.590> to

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
other thing that I'd like that comes to

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.710 
other thing that I'd like that comes to
mind<00:05:44.889> is<00:05:45.039> for<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.610> proper<00:05:45.940> demons<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.450> be<00:05:46.570> used

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
mind is for the proper demons to be used

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.150 
mind is for the proper demons to be used
for<00:05:46.990> each<00:05:47.050> spec<00:05:47.410> but<00:05:47.620> that's<00:05:47.800> already<00:05:48.010> been

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
for each spec but that's already been

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.980 
for each spec but that's already been
announced<00:05:48.370> so<00:05:48.580> it's<00:05:49.300> not<00:05:49.479> really<00:05:49.539> something

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
announced so it's not really something

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.190 
announced so it's not really something
that<00:05:50.200> I<00:05:50.320> can<00:05:50.470> really<00:05:50.590> talk<00:05:50.830> any<00:05:51.070> further<00:05:51.520> about

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
that I can really talk any further about

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.350 
that I can really talk any further about
as<00:05:53.200> for<00:05:53.560> distros<00:05:53.950> AoE<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.550> mean<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.940> think<00:05:55.030> it's

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
as for distros AoE I mean I think it's

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.170 
as for distros AoE I mean I think it's
fine<00:05:56.220> clearly<00:05:57.220> it's<00:05:57.340> more<00:05:57.550> limited<00:05:57.969> when<00:05:58.090> you

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
fine clearly it's more limited when you

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.610 
fine clearly it's more limited when you
compare<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.659> see<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:58.900> corruption<00:05:59.349> or<00:05:59.440> hell

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
compare it to see the corruption or hell

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.140 
compare it to see the corruption or hell
fire<00:06:00.300> which<00:06:01.300> there<00:06:01.930> were<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.110> lot<00:06:02.380> better<00:06:02.530> with

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
fire which there were a lot better with

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.910 
fire which there were a lot better with
it's<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.390> are<00:06:03.480> moving<00:06:03.750> around<00:06:03.920> destro

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
it's that are moving around destro

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.040 
it's that are moving around destro
really<00:06:05.280> needs<00:06:05.700> their<00:06:06.060> targets<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.720> stay<00:06:06.930> in

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
really needs their targets to stay in

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.690 
really needs their targets to stay in
one<00:06:07.200> spot<00:06:07.230> for<00:06:07.560> random<00:06:07.950> fire<00:06:08.100> to<00:06:08.280> be<00:06:08.400> really

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
one spot for random fire to be really

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.690 
one spot for random fire to be really
effective<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.390> efficient<00:06:10.460> but<00:06:11.460> it's<00:06:11.580> almost

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
effective and efficient but it's almost

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.820 
effective and efficient but it's almost
like<00:06:11.910> it<00:06:12.030> des<00:06:12.690> Rosiers<00:06:13.020> we<00:06:13.170> needs<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.560> be<00:06:13.650> that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
like it des Rosiers we needs to be that

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.800 
like it des Rosiers we needs to be that
way<00:06:14.040> like<00:06:14.430> if<00:06:14.820> you<00:06:15.060> made<00:06:15.240> it<00:06:15.270> so<00:06:15.480> that<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.690> could

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
way like if you made it so that it could

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.180 
way like if you made it so that it could
also<00:06:16.020> be<00:06:16.170> good<00:06:16.350> against<00:06:16.560> moving<00:06:16.770> targets

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
also be good against moving targets

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.180 
also be good against moving targets
gesture<00:06:17.550> would<00:06:17.730> almost<00:06:17.940> be<00:06:18.150> too<00:06:18.360> good<00:06:18.680> I<00:06:19.680> don't

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
gesture would almost be too good I don't

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.710 
gesture would almost be too good I don't
really<00:06:20.280> think<00:06:20.520> destro<00:06:20.940> need<00:06:21.120> any<00:06:21.240> bulks<00:06:21.540> right

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
really think destro need any bulks right

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.510 
really think destro need any bulks right

tete<00:06:36.540> what<00:06:37.470> Morlock<00:06:37.980> spec<00:06:38.310> do<00:06:38.520> you<00:06:38.610> think<00:06:38.880> is

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
tete what Morlock spec do you think is

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.900 
tete what Morlock spec do you think is
the<00:06:39.030> best<00:06:39.300> currently<00:06:40.020> or<00:06:40.230> what<00:06:41.190> spec<00:06:41.520> is<00:06:41.700> your

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
the best currently or what spec is your

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.240 
the best currently or what spec is your
favorite<00:06:42.480> so<00:06:43.200> while<00:06:43.560> answer<00:06:43.830> both<00:06:43.980> of<00:06:44.040> these

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250 
favorite so while answer both of these

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.390 
favorite so while answer both of these
right<00:06:45.030> now<00:06:45.150> the<00:06:45.210> best<00:06:45.450> spec<00:06:45.690> is<00:06:45.870> destruction

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
right now the best spec is destruction

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.520 
right now the best spec is destruction
by<00:06:47.400> a<00:06:47.430> couple<00:06:47.820> hundred<00:06:47.970> in<00:06:48.270> simulations<00:06:48.900> but

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
by a couple hundred in simulations but

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.220 
by a couple hundred in simulations but
in<00:06:49.850> practice<00:06:50.850> you<00:06:51.210> can<00:06:51.360> tell<00:06:51.660> that<00:06:51.690> the<00:06:52.050> best

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
in practice you can tell that the best

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.720 
in practice you can tell that the best
warlocks<00:06:52.680> in<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:52.920> world<00:06:53.100> that<00:06:53.310> are<00:06:53.370> using

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
warlocks in the world that are using

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.430 
warlocks in the world that are using
destruction<00:06:54.270> tend<00:06:54.510> to<00:06:54.630> be<00:06:54.750> several<00:06:55.200> steps

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
destruction tend to be several steps

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.050 
destruction tend to be several steps
above<00:06:55.650> the<00:06:55.830> ones<00:06:56.100> that<00:06:56.280> are<00:06:56.370> using<00:06:56.610> affliction

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
above the ones that are using affliction

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.180 
above the ones that are using affliction
and<00:06:57.240> even<00:06:58.200> more<00:06:58.380> so<00:06:58.560> than<00:06:58.680> the<00:06:58.740> ones<00:06:58.950> that<00:06:59.100> are

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
and even more so than the ones that are

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.850 
and even more so than the ones that are
using<00:06:59.460> demonology<00:07:00.060> well<00:07:00.960> in<00:07:01.050> motion<00:07:01.530> colors

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
using demonology well in motion colors

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.400 
using demonology well in motion colors
anyway<00:07:02.070> so<00:07:02.910> if<00:07:03.540> you're<00:07:03.780> looking<00:07:03.990> at<00:07:04.050> min<00:07:04.200> max

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
anyway so if you're looking at min max

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.140 
anyway so if you're looking at min max
your<00:07:04.650> damage<00:07:04.980> you're<00:07:05.430> going<00:07:05.850> to<00:07:05.910> want<00:07:06.030> to<00:07:06.120> be

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
your damage you're going to want to be

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.410 
your damage you're going to want to be
using<00:07:06.450> destruction<00:07:06.960> for<00:07:07.770> now<00:07:07.890> at<00:07:08.070> least<00:07:08.420> in

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.420 
using destruction for now at least in

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.210 
using destruction for now at least in
terms<00:07:09.570> of<00:07:09.750> what<00:07:09.930> spec<00:07:10.200> is<00:07:10.320> my<00:07:10.440> favorite<00:07:10.980> it's

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
terms of what spec is my favorite it's

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.480 
terms of what spec is my favorite it's
definitely<00:07:11.820> affliction<00:07:12.660> it's<00:07:13.620> it<00:07:14.010> is<00:07:14.250> and

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
definitely affliction it's it is and

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.730 
definitely affliction it's it is and
always<00:07:14.610> will<00:07:14.880> be<00:07:14.940> my<00:07:15.090> main<00:07:15.390> spec<00:07:15.660> I<00:07:15.810> think<00:07:16.080> the

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
always will be my main spec I think the

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.800 
always will be my main spec I think the
only<00:07:16.860> time<00:07:17.100> I<00:07:17.130> probably<00:07:17.730> would<00:07:18.060> stop<00:07:18.330> using<00:07:18.600> it

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
only time I probably would stop using it

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.980 
only time I probably would stop using it
is<00:07:18.960> if<00:07:19.170> it<00:07:19.380> would<00:07:19.590> simchas<00:07:20.220> way<00:07:21.000> way<00:07:21.420> several

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
is if it would simchas way way several

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.120 
is if it would simchas way way several
thousands<00:07:22.620> of<00:07:23.060> dps<00:07:24.060> below<00:07:24.420> destruction<00:07:25.140> it

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
thousands of dps below destruction it

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.620 
thousands of dps below destruction it
just<00:07:26.340> suits<00:07:26.460> my<00:07:26.670> playstyle<00:07:27.150> and<00:07:27.210> I<00:07:27.360> enjoy

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630 
just suits my playstyle and I enjoy

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.350 
just suits my playstyle and I enjoy
using<00:07:27.840> affliction<00:07:28.410> the<00:07:28.500> most<00:07:28.850> so<00:07:29.850> that<00:07:30.210> does

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
using affliction the most so that does

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.150 
using affliction the most so that does
it<00:07:30.450> for<00:07:30.540> my<00:07:30.630> first<00:07:30.840> episode<00:07:31.170> more<00:07:31.380> dots<00:07:31.560> if<00:07:31.830> you
