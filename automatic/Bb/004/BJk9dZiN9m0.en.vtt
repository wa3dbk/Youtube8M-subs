well looking back it looks as though you
know<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.159> then<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:08.060> know<00:01:08.149> it's<00:01:08.600> easy<00:01:08.780> to<00:01:08.930> say

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
afterwards but it looks as though the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.499 
afterwards but it looks as though the
referees<00:01:10.430> got<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:10.700> right<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.149> was<00:01:11.329> caught

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
referees got it right then I was caught

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.020 
referees got it right then I was caught
him<00:01:11.659> with<00:01:11.780> his<00:01:11.810> foot<00:01:12.079> I<00:01:12.200> think<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:13.820> know<00:01:13.909> he

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
him with his foot I think so you know he

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.060 
him with his foot I think so you know he
touched<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.450> Marianne<00:01:15.229> touches<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.740> away<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
touched it Marianne touches it away and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.950 
touched it Marianne touches it away and
then<00:01:16.159> Ben<00:01:16.369> comes<00:01:16.640> through<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:17.090> think<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.869> his

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
then Ben comes through I think it's his

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.880 
then Ben comes through I think it's his
momentum<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.560> catches<00:01:18.979> Shannon<00:01:20.560> yeah<00:01:21.560> it's
