like alignments

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
like alignments
I<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:19.680> heroic<00:00:20.100> characters<00:00:20.640> when<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> run

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I like heroic characters when I run

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.890 
I like heroic characters when I run
campaigns<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.350> don't<00:00:22.830> let<00:00:22.980> anybody<00:00:23.779> play<00:00:24.779> an

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
campaigns I don't let anybody play an

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.960 
campaigns I don't let anybody play an
evil<00:00:25.140> character<00:00:25.320> that's<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.460> me

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
evil character that's just me

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.250 
evil character that's just me
I<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.480> heroes<00:00:29.300> but<00:00:30.300> I've<00:00:30.449> come<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> think

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I want heroes but I've come to think

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.600 
I want heroes but I've come to think
that<00:00:31.439> some<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> restrictions<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.520> are

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that some of the restrictions that are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.959 
that some of the restrictions that are
in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> game<00:00:33.120> are<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.630> too<00:00:33.930> tight<00:00:34.969> there

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
in the game are a little too tight there

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.080 
in the game are a little too tight there
are<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.750> makes<00:00:36.930> sense<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.500> example

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
are some that makes sense for example

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.639 
are some that makes sense for example
paladin's<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.210> lawful<00:00:39.570> good<00:00:39.719> lawful<00:00:40.230> good<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
paladin's are lawful good lawful good is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.220 
paladin's are lawful good lawful good is
a<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:41.190> hard<00:00:41.489> alignment<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> live<00:00:42.270> by<00:00:42.480> but

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a really hard alignment to live by but

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
a really hard alignment to live by but
that's<00:00:43.379> kind<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> point<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.370> paladin<00:00:45.329> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's kind of the point a paladin is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
that's kind of the point a paladin is
supposed<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> paragon<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> virtue<00:00:47.450> he

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
supposed to be this paragon of virtue he

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.810 
supposed to be this paragon of virtue he
is<00:00:48.570> supposed<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.559> she<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.070> supposed<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
is supposed to be or she is supposed to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.840 
is supposed to be or she is supposed to
be<00:00:51.000> held<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> standard<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> nigh

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
be held to a standard that is nigh

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.900 
be held to a standard that is nigh
impossible<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:55.170> achieve<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.399> okay<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
impossible to achieve so I'm okay if

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.979 
impossible to achieve so I'm okay if
paladin's<00:00:57.719> remain<00:00:58.020> lawful<00:00:58.469> good<00:00:59.629> but<00:01:00.629> there

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
paladin's remain lawful good but there

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
paladin's remain lawful good but there
are<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.289> classes<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
are other classes that I think the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.750 
are other classes that I think the
alignment<00:01:03.239> restrictions<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:04.760> inappropriate

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
alignment restrictions are inappropriate

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109 
alignment restrictions are inappropriate
for<00:01:05.970> example<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> barbarian<00:01:07.619> yes<00:01:08.460> barbarians

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for example the barbarian yes barbarians

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.200 
for example the barbarian yes barbarians
aren't<00:01:09.540> lawful<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.030> don't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
aren't lawful I get that but I don't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
aren't lawful I get that but I don't
think<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.570> should<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> require<00:01:13.619> them<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
think you should have to require them to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.120 
think you should have to require them to
be<00:01:14.189> chaotic<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:15.450> not<00:01:16.320> lawful<00:01:17.299> monks<00:01:19.130> I've

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
be chaotic just not lawful monks I've

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.620 
be chaotic just not lawful monks I've
done<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.640> fair<00:01:20.850> amount<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> reading<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
done a little fair amount of reading of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.370 
done a little fair amount of reading of
actual<00:01:22.409> monks<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.600> they<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.780> strike<00:01:25.140> me<00:01:25.170> as

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
actual monks and they don't strike me as

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.969 
actual monks and they don't strike me as
particularly<00:01:26.130> lawful<00:01:26.850> disciplined

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
particularly lawful disciplined

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
particularly lawful disciplined
dedicated<00:01:28.979> yes<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> doesn't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
dedicated yes but that doesn't

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.550 
dedicated yes but that doesn't
necessarily<00:01:30.950> mean<00:01:32.210> lawful<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.350> means

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
necessarily mean lawful that just means

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.749 
necessarily mean lawful that just means
they're<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:35.009> chaotic<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
they're not chaotic so I think that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.899 
they're not chaotic so I think that
monks<00:01:39.030> should<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.590> chaotic<00:01:41.009> let

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
monks should just be not chaotic let

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
monks should just be not chaotic let
them<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.299> let<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.689> neutral<00:01:43.259> good<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
them be let there be neutral good and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.600 
them be let there be neutral good and
neutral<00:01:44.460> evil<00:01:45.890> monks<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.130> no<00:01:47.250> problem<00:01:47.579> with

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
neutral evil monks I got no problem with

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
neutral evil monks I got no problem with
that<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> I've<00:01:50.759> discussed<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.009> Warlock

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that and I've discussed the the Warlock

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.889 
that and I've discussed the the Warlock
recently<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> said<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
recently and where I said that the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929 
recently and where I said that the
current<00:01:55.170> alignment<00:01:55.740> restriction<00:01:56.340> seems<00:01:56.610> very

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
current alignment restriction seems very

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.450 
current alignment restriction seems very
tight<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.689> now<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> GM<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.310> gonna

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
tight to me now if a GM would was gonna

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.069 
tight to me now if a GM would was gonna
say<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.210> okay<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> really

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
say you know like okay I want to really

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
say you know like okay I want to really
play<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.740> demonic<00:02:02.189> background

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
play up the whole demonic background

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
play up the whole demonic background
thing<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.360> say<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.719> can't<00:02:03.960> be

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
thing then you just say they can't be

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.389 
thing then you just say they can't be
good<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:05.219> makes<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.240> less<00:02:06.450> than<00:02:06.840> ideal<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
good that makes it less than ideal for

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270

it to run would probably be the true

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
neutrals I mean how do you run on that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.150 
neutrals I mean how do you run on that

razor's edge of true neutrality how do

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.370 
razor's edge of true neutrality how do
you<00:02:46.340> keep<00:02:46.610> yourself<00:02:47.209> from<00:02:47.420> falling<00:02:47.870> into<00:02:48.049> one

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
you keep yourself from falling into one

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.130 
you keep yourself from falling into one

able to do it I didn't even try it as it
as<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> player<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.900> always<00:02:57.709> wanted<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.010> play

more a little more real-world I guess

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.680 
more a little more real-world I guess
you<00:03:03.319> could<00:03:03.470> say<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.940> think<00:03:04.940> at<00:03:05.030> one<00:03:05.060> time<00:03:05.269> in<00:03:05.599> my

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you could say I think at one time in my

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.170 
you could say I think at one time in my

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
life I probably consider myself good it

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.839 
life I probably consider myself good it
was<00:03:08.329> very<00:03:08.690> much<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.930> an<00:03:09.140> individualist<00:03:09.799> at<00:03:10.370> one

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
was very much of an individualist at one

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.150 
was very much of an individualist at one
time<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.209> my<00:03:11.299> life<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.079> now<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.650> think<00:03:13.069> of

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
time in my life and now I think of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.280 
time in my life and now I think of
myself<00:03:13.310> more<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:13.730> neutral<00:03:14.180> good<00:03:14.360> I'm<00:03:14.870> willing

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
myself more as neutral good I'm willing

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.720 
myself more as neutral good I'm willing
to<00:03:15.319> live<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.860> code<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.250> law<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
to live by the code of law but I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.430 
to live by the code of law but I
understand<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.209> there<00:03:17.359> are<00:03:17.389> times<00:03:17.720> when<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
understand that there are times when the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.270 
understand that there are times when the
laws<00:03:18.620> are<00:03:18.829> wrong<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.540> balance<00:03:21.019> law<00:03:21.560> with

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
laws are wrong so I balance law with

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.000 
laws are wrong so I balance law with
chaos<00:03:23.030> freedom<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.350> come<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
chaos freedom and I come out in the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830 
chaos freedom and I come out in the
middle<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.280> with<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.670> neutral<00:03:26.060> good<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.510> want<00:03:26.750> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
middle of with a neutral good I want the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.379 
middle of with a neutral good I want the
