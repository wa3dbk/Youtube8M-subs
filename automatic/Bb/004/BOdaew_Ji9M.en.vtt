00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to the rat both of these dogs qualify

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.960 
to the rat both of these dogs qualify
they<00:01:15.420> did<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.750> job<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.549> that<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.759> the

first level and we had two out of two

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.749 
first level and we had two out of two
queue<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:19.979> that's<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.340> good<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
queue so that's really good for the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.810 
queue so that's really good for the
master<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.360> oh<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.680> dogs<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.400> people<00:01:23.670> use

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the very beginner dogs to see if they'll

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
the very beginner dogs to see if they'll
even<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> intro

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.020 

but<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> tunnels<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.530> like

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
but that's what the tunnels look like

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.180 
but that's what the tunnels look like
but<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.330> dig<00:01:36.510> out<00:01:36.890> respect<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.040> day

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
but we have to dig out respect all day

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.710 
but we have to dig out respect all day
yesterday<00:01:39.920> running<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.070> pump<00:01:41.340> out<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.850> had

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
yesterday running some pump out and had

yesterday running some pump out and had
a<00:01:42.750> pump<00:01:43.080> because<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:43.710> full<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> water

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a pump because this was full of water

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
a pump because this was full of water
yesterday<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> rain<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.020> had

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
year we did this we actually had to dig

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
year we did this we actually had to dig
the<00:01:55.259> tunnel<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> day<00:01:55.950> off<00:01:56.360> because<00:01:57.360> we

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the tunnel the day off because we

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.210 
the tunnel the day off because we
