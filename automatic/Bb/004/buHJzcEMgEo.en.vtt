00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 Today Tuesday I have the most 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 real man's day and i'm like a girl 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.630
 Of course, prepared my guest 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.630
 Sergey Lazarev Good morning 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:51.060
 good morning everyone good morning how 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 you relax you know me 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:59.340
 relax and fear not to strain and 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.350
 work turns out nervous but in fact 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.390
 Actually better rest is a dream 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.479
 unconditionally therefore that also never 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.729
 gets since you know them 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.759
 the last time is four by five 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.060
 maximum because some permanent 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.979
 rehearsals in there concerts come ice and and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
 it all happens mostly at night 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 therefore I use time exclusively 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 sitting position on the plane or there 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.039
 machines are we doing if you can 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 somehow they were always betrayed by such 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.360
 sofas 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 everywhere where itâ€™s okay to get enough sleep 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 of course that's what we have to do 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.740
 I 'll have to go to your watch yesterday 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 unreal schedule you literally 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.899
 Tomorrow will be play 9 chad to the leader 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 from play 9 then I have play 13 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.920
 as many as 14 numbers and going on tour and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 Ukraine starts the tour from the 17th 6 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.899
 blinked six cities this is the first big 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.709
 tour from the new program with the new program 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.020
 and which I tried on just in March 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.550
 on the eve of the color in Moscow in the Olympic 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 now finally i brought this 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 grand program 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.360
 I will bring more precisely to Ukraine at least 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.980
 least six cities that they will see 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.690
 this program I am very happy that it is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.190
 that this will happen because whether colored 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.920
 we have been preparing for a long time and have something to show 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.610
 live sound 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.220
 Grand dancers and musicians 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.010
 scenery costumes that is actually 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.170
 this is what really long 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.030
 prepared and for what it is absolutely not a shame 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.300
 what I am proud of and I think that people like 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.070
 will come to this show in Ukraine rejoice 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.550
 because of me do not get the maximum 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.710
 pleasure 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.710
 clearly that the concerts every day do not even have 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.660
 break that's 17 started yes yes then 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.700
 we are up to 22 how are you recovering 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.920
 we are very difficult to leave because because 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.520
 that a two-hour live concert is completely 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.560
 live sound 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.330
 but but on the other hand yes you just 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 is in good shape and you understand that 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.600
 tomorrow you have a new concert and 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.239
 this is a new make-up from the viewer plus 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.100
 Of course the audience is very nourished, I do not 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.860
 bite after the concert after the concert I 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.959
 absolutely no one with some partying her 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.180
 I'm not going anywhere here I finished the concept 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.459
 i would become 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.350
 mobile phone charging the same 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.310
 and I charge up the next concert with I 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.350
 absolutely well here I am closing in myself 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.080
 I try not to scatter energy because 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.030
 that will not need her choice among the halls 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.430
 large amount of time content therefore 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.910
 Of course I try as much as possible 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.840
 close and restore us 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.489
 turn out to be rituals for 25 minutes of hope i 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.209
 watched a concert Zemfira she smoke 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.640
 a cigarette 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.640
 I no, I do not smoke in any case because 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.010
 what 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.959
 again the breathing for accounted for very 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.550
 move a lot and sing at the same time 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.160
 alive so i'm generally not in 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.470
 In no case do I not smoke 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.560
 we are always 5 min before the concert are going 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.730
 the whole team than you know how it is 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.860
 you look when western concert they all 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.280
 gather this prayer no little not 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.930
 tea we are there about myself every but always 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.240
 always get together 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.250
 tune in strongly one kind of like 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.410
 one concert is necessary one way because we 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.930
 all doing this show is a big team on 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.239
 scene a lot a lot of people and so we're like 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.410
 whole single organism headed with me to be 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.419
 must act and each other 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.870
 feel so five before the concert 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.970
 we always backstage together we set up 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.790
 we wish each other night and once 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.060
 today you came from the premiere time is very 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.050

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.970
 for example not even happened yet 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.810
 Russian TV channels is absolutely 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.380
 new track or rather track in it in the album 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.010
 lazarev in that house this cancer we have in 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.690
 concert program but the video is perfect 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.550
 fresh just you just baked 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.669

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.150

 the Internet has not yet appeared here I am 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.150
 only here today 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:12.680
 yes therefore in general that such a little bit 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.990
 may be an unexpected video from me but 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.330
 maybe minutes hooligan but at extreme 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.070
 least boy are you already adult hooligans 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.850
 and here in the tumor they drove away 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.040
