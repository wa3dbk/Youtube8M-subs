second time is easier you don't have

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.499 
second time is easier you don't have
like<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.429> initial<00:02:01.850> like<00:02:02.060> wondering<00:02:02.359> what's

a<00:04:08.849> lot<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.330> ondo<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.959> was<00:04:10.110> basically<00:04:10.260> all

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
a lot of ondo it was basically all

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.690

had<00:04:18.280> early<00:04:19.090> bondo<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:21.250> I'm<00:04:21.400> think<00:04:21.639> I'm

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
had early bondo and but I'm think I'm

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.360 
had early bondo and but I'm think I'm
happy<00:04:22.030> with<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.360> overall<00:04:22.389> paint<00:04:22.990> job<00:04:23.290> so<00:04:24.070> it's
