I'm<00:00:00.269> now<00:00:00.599> going<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.020> demonstrate<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.829> program

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
I'm now going to demonstrate the program

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.610 
I'm now going to demonstrate the program
shift<00:00:02.639> feature<00:00:02.909> on<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.689> Fuji<00:00:04.310> x10<00:00:05.310> camera<00:00:06.120> as

shift feature on the Fuji x10 camera as

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.589 
shift feature on the Fuji x10 camera as
you<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.799> see<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.790> camera<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.420> already

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
you can see here the camera is already

it's<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.219> jiggly<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.239> just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
it's a little bit jiggly there just

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.450 
it's a little bit jiggly there just
because<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> way<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.559> dials<00:00:55.920> work<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.430> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
because of the way the dials work when I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740 
because of the way the dials work when I
have<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.879> camera<00:00:57.059> hooked<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
have the camera hooked up to the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
have the camera hooked up to the
computer<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.100> all<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> those

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
computer but you can see all of those

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
computer but you can see all of those
are<00:00:59.730> alternatives<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.859> yield<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> exact

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
are alternatives they yield the exact

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
are alternatives they yield the exact
same<00:01:02.579> exposure<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> original<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
same exposure as the original one now if

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.460 
same exposure as the original one now if
I<00:01:04.949> roll<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> dials<00:01:06.420> back<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I roll the dials back through the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.590 
I roll the dials back through the
original<00:01:07.979> value<00:01:08.400> you'll<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
original value you'll see that it's in

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
original value you'll see that it's in
white<00:01:10.400> I'm<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.580> sure<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> do

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
white I'm not sure if I'm going to do

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.980 
white I'm not sure if I'm going to do
that<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:14.180> four<00:01:15.180> point<00:01:15.450> five<00:01:15.689> at

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that here or not if four point five at

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
that here or not if four point five at
one<00:01:16.140> four<00:01:16.409> hundredth<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.979> second<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.970> now

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
one four hundredth of a second but now

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
one four hundredth of a second but now
in<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.110> few<00:01:19.259> seconds<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.830> am<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> pop<00:01:20.490> up

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
in a few seconds I am going to pop up

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.630 
in a few seconds I am going to pop up
the<00:01:20.850> flash<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.740> you'll<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> flash<00:01:23.340> icon

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the flash and you'll see the flash icon

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
the flash and you'll see the flash icon
come<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> upper<00:01:25.500> left<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:28.560> went

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
come up in the upper left there it went

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.090 
come up in the upper left there it went
white<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.390> will<00:01:30.630> mean<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.829> flash

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
white and that will mean that the flash

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249 
white and that will mean that the flash
unit<00:01:32.490> has<00:01:32.790> been<00:01:32.820> popped<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.780> activated

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
unit has been popped up and is activated

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.730 
unit has been popped up and is activated
and<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.799> turn<00:01:35.009> off<00:01:35.310> program<00:01:36.740> shift

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and that will turn off program shift

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
and that will turn off program shift
because<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> forces<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> camera<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
because that forces the camera to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
because that forces the camera to
reevaluate<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> exposure<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.729> light<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
reevaluate the exposure and light of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.990 
reevaluate the exposure and light of
flash<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> there's<00:01:43.979> no<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.280> program<00:01:44.490> shift

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
flash so there's no more program shift

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660 
flash so there's no more program shift
in<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> fact<00:01:45.570> though<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> course<00:01:46.159> now<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.460> pop

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
in a fact though of course now I can pop

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.389 
in a fact though of course now I can pop
the<00:01:47.820> flash<00:01:48.060> back<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:52.070> we<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> use

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the flash back down and we can use

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.240 
the flash back down and we can use
program<00:01:54.000> shift<00:01:54.270> again<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.229> by<00:01:55.890> turning

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
program shift again now with by turning

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.590 
program shift again now with by turning
you<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> command<00:01:56.939> dial<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> sub
