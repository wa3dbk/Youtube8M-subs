00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:27.079
 Hello, I will show you 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.790
 our first gift is this cup and in my opinion 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.449
 make it easier for them to 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.850
 do not do us just yet 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.010
 ordinary boy but the markers should 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.100
 to be with paint and why yes because 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.839
 tale markers do not wash off 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:05.979
 under what circumstances 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:11.070
 you have or just a marker is a plane 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:15.190
 which today we will only do 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.690
 come up with your drawings and portray him 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:23.780
 on our guns everything is simple and easy 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.190
 because it is an indelible marker more precisely 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 whiteboard marker 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.360
 see what happens even if very 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.720
 fat in view of 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.650
 and wait about an hour by the kitchen or 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.330
 waited 35 minutes and rubbed 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.180
 See how easy it is. 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.540
 our finger and so I do not advise taking 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.540
 these 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.010
 they again 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 auto-land 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.640
 than summer through actively look better 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.640
 so the fact we most 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.260
 what is simpler and better 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:15.160
 so we read uri. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.660
 simple to us about the essence 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.260
 and I will visit 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.020
 we got a black marker 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.200
 draw little body 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.200
 legs are not pants legs 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 happened 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.370
 anarchy about 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.540

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:00.370

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:10.300
 ca n't go see how cute it is 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:15.070

 Well, finally, so do your delicious 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.450
 A gift this here such elk liver or 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.770
 deer 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.209
 I do not know exactly who of the cookies 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:58.400
 salty crackers 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.580
 i am on dance of me next tasty and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.459
 edible gift we need 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.900
 preferably rectangular shaped cookies 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.530
 crackers it is desirable that they be 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.190
 rashka- like round n . 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.030
 I wish that they were not very large 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.739
 marshmallow preferably small and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.209
 melted chocolate 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.700
 First of all, take the cookies 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.410
 rectangular shapes and put them on our 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.680
 plate and if you want you can break it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.510
 in half I'll put them here 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.240
 this country 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:41.270
 more precisely this one because no more precise 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.169
 because deer has us by the way 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:50.450
 already revealed the secret we will do the moose 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.310
 or deer probably do not know deer and y 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.370
 here it is such a skin 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.960
 so glass and so for glue we will 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:03.080
 you can use melted chocolate 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:08.060
 Nati can not know what things 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:16.120
 first open mmdm and pour on 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:25.930
 it is desirable that the plate and separate 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:25.930
 brown so green and red 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:32.840
 separate and now tell 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.539
 eyes it will be brown vat us and it 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.880
 will be red and green will be like 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:44.170
 decoration and now it's time to open crackers 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.870
 and get about 4 things for me 4 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:51.760
 since I have the door of cookies and now 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.590
 on this thing and and we will put like this 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.160
 on the cookie I can also be in half 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.170
 to split 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:03.190
 but my cookies are not big fingers 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:08.590
 I will be like this so now we proceed 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:11.140
 take our cradle like a spoonful of flour 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.160
 taxi and did not enter and first glue 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:20.020
 horns it will be like horns and dunk 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:26.140
 chocolate it will not only be beautiful and 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:28.750
 taste wow I'm so quail nightmares usually 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.900
 not everything will flow but it is to them already 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.470
 guessed it would be an alley though 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.470
 maybe moose 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:47.830
 All very easy to brew cocoa 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:51.220
 our normal system and fill the lobe 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.220
 our how 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.300
 So 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:05.270
 and stir and now the most interesting and 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.570
 Himself interesting in is that we in this as and have 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:13.780
 us and punk are one as worse 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:16.870
 yummy for example it's marshmallow 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:22.490
 By the way there you can add cream glue 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:28.570
 all you like pour cocoa yeah yeah 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:33.190
