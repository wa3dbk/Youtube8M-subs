00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.550
 or energy consumption per salt 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.180
 the process which allows the cells to withdraw accumulated energy in the compounds 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.120
 organic 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.379
 is the cellular respiration 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.860
 the cellular respiration in most animal and plant organisms depends 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.090
 largely from a binary whistle giving into the cytoplasm stump 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.890
 called mitochondria 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.590
 it is common is called 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.689
 with the trio to one to the set of mitochondria of a hit 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.140
 the number of mitochondria in a cell is very variable 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 possibly a few tens into several hundred 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.640
 observation under the electron microscope showed that the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.329
 mitochondria are delimited by two lipoprotein membranes one 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.890
 externalization and a fringed internal 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.310
 forming the mitochondrial ridges 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.829
 the interior of the organism 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.390
 is filled by a colored and called mitochondrial matrix 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.120
 mitochondria as well as chloroplasts and without 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.680
 triumphs has in that period certain amount of dna rm file dreams 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.129
 this justifies the capacity of these bodies 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.980
 dc at all precarious 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.110
 every mitochondria can grow to stretch new cpi strangle 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.120
 mitochondria 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.180
 and it is by this mechanism that it is the correct renewal 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 of mitochondria in cells 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.270
 after cell division 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210
 ways to release the energy 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.510
 symbolically we can represent the mechanism by which 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.900
 to be an astra energy contained in the carbon chains of the compounds 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.310
 organic molecules by simple chemical equation one more glucose molecule 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 six molecules of oxygen 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.210
 react 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.470
 nÃ© by actions and 'marca' forming six molecules of carbon dioxide 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.390
 but six molecules of water more if yes 74 than in the heat days 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 however the process is not done directly inside the cell 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 the direct action of glucose by the contingent would entail the release of 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.690
 of considerable amount of energy at one time and so she would not know 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.040
 glucose should be metabolized by 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.670
 steps on the action of numerous enzymes that acted a sequence perfectly 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.759
 programmed the organic molecule and glucose 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.320
 should be fragmented into smaller and smaller molecules 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.109
 exhaling releasing the energy contained therein 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:15.299
 this energy will then be collected and accumulated in special molecules 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.040
 smaller than a compound 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.869
 called 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.279
 particularly designated for this purpose 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:25.260
 during the series of reactions because past technical ecology compose the 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:26.559
 organic farming 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:30.109
 the detachment of progeny lines stung several times 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.830
 it is important that you remember that the degree of acidity is a medium 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.899
 depends fundamentally on the quantity of rivers and we have brought 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.559
 in this environment 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.410
 if the hydrogen release is continuous 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.610
 during the acerola respiratory activity it would be understandable that the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.929
 intracellularly became more and more acidic 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.749
 it is known that the cell dies artistic medium 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.599
 to get around this situation 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.269
 the hydrogen at the end of the process whose function is to 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.819
 withdraw from the protocol on the cellular phone those hydrogens released during 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.500
 reactions 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.019
 in the great majority of living beings the final shift of hydrogen and oxygen 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.580
 it gets hydrogen 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.729
 and with it forms the water that has footprint and other 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.929
 This is the main reason why one can not live in an audience 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.340
 what we have just described is simply what is called breath 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.210
 aerobic respiration that is only done 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.079
 and presence of air 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.519
 outside 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.869
 there are however 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.309
 beings who live and breathe in absolute absence of oxygen 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.499
 they make the breath called anna was the scholarship 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.169
 in the cells and such released hydrogen molecules are collected 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.539
 other types of hydrogen receptors than to be 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.739
 in any possible way we are removed from the intracellular environment 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.290
 as they will not match the casey jennings 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.689
 there will also be no formation of water as final product
