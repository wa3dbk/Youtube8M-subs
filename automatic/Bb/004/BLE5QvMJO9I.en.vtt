looked something like this in the case
and<00:00:06.509> what<00:00:06.899> I'm<00:00:06.990> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.319> first<00:00:07.649> before<00:00:07.919> I

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
and what I'm going to do first before I

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.240 
and what I'm going to do first before I
cut<00:00:08.790> out<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> top<00:00:09.240> part<00:00:09.540> up<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:10.080> um<00:00:10.860> I

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
cut out the top part up here is um I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.060 
cut out the top part up here is um I
want<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> make<00:00:12.240> sure<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:13.410> know<00:00:13.500> dvd-rom

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
want to make sure that you know dvd-rom

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.189 
want to make sure that you know dvd-rom
solar<00:00:14.400> or<00:00:14.610> drips<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.910> everything<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.540> that's

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
solar or drips and everything so that's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.519 
solar or drips and everything so that's
what<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> would<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.619> first<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:18.180> also<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:19.170> had<00:00:19.439> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
what I would do first and also I had to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
what I would do first and also I had to
make<00:00:19.680> some<00:00:19.920> minor<00:00:20.160> adjustments<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.939> had<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> go

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
make some minor adjustments I had to go

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
make some minor adjustments I had to go
back<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.080> here<00:00:22.320> inside<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.970> driving

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
back in here inside the driving

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.920 
back in here inside the driving
underneath<00:00:24.590> I<00:00:25.590> had<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.340> cut<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> down<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.269> little

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
underneath I had to cut it down a little

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.630 
underneath I had to cut it down a little
bit<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> Plexiglas<00:00:28.800> would<00:00:28.980> fit<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.279> top<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
bit so the Plexiglas would fit on top of

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.500 
bit so the Plexiglas would fit on top of
it<00:00:29.760> because<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.119> wasn't<00:00:30.420> top<00:00:31.109> wasn't<00:00:31.380> closing

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
it because it wasn't top wasn't closing

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.830 
it because it wasn't top wasn't closing
down<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:33.950> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.940> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
down all the way so I had to do that so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.280 
down all the way so I had to do that so
let's<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.140> give<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.380> shot<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:39.290> still

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
let's just give a shot see if it still

00:00:40.290 --> 00:01:10.469 
let's just give a shot see if it still
works

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
cut it I would say over Lapid by about

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.499 
cut it I would say over Lapid by about
that<00:04:50.330> much<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:52.310> then<00:04:52.460> just<00:04:52.610> make<00:04:52.850> your<00:04:53.030> draw

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509
