did<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.730> obviously<00:00:03.150> such<00:00:03.389> an<00:00:03.570> incredibly

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
did is obviously such an incredibly

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.040 
did is obviously such an incredibly
gifted<00:00:04.770> director<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.370> storyteller<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.960> I

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.050 
gifted director and storyteller and I

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.470 
gifted director and storyteller and I
think<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.799> big<00:00:08.429> part<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.940> has<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.480> with

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
think a big part of that has to do with

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.140 
think a big part of that has to do with
the<00:00:12.480> emphasis<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.230> he<00:00:13.320> places<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:14.150> humanity

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the emphasis that he places on humanity

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.890 
the emphasis that he places on humanity
and<00:00:15.389> character<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:17.099> I<00:00:17.759> think<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.750> what

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and character and so I think it's what

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480 
and character and so I think it's what
sets<00:00:19.140> him<00:00:19.260> apart<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.949> ways<00:00:20.190> he

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
sets him apart in a lot of ways he

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.790 
sets him apart in a lot of ways he
doesn't<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.000> things<00:00:21.180> by<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> book<00:00:21.800> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
doesn't just do things by the book and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
doesn't just do things by the book and
that's<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> things<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.300> draws<00:00:24.869> me

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that's one of the things that draws me

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.120 
that's one of the things that draws me
to<00:00:25.199> him<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:26.310> an<00:00:26.490> actor<00:00:26.850> and<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> also<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.980> an

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to him as an actor and and also as an

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.370 
to him as an actor and and also as an
audience<00:00:29.400> member<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:30.090> his<00:00:30.359> projects<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.289> his

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
audience member of his projects and his

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590 
audience member of his projects and his
stories

what Scott Chambliss is able to create

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.060 
what Scott Chambliss is able to create
is<00:00:39.180> incredibly<00:00:40.180> rich<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:41.070> multi-dimensional

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
work and and really you know it's all

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.859 
work and and really you know it's all
about<00:01:09.100> for<00:01:09.429> us<00:01:09.490> as<00:01:09.909> actors<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.630> really

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
about for us as actors it really

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.700 
about for us as actors it really
ultimately<00:01:11.440> becomes<00:01:11.860> about<00:01:12.840> mmm<00:01:13.840> like<00:01:14.170> fabric

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
ultimately becomes about mmm like fabric

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.249 
ultimately becomes about mmm like fabric
is<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.880> word<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.210> kind<00:01:16.509> of<00:01:16.569> think<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.899> it's<00:01:17.080> like

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
is the word I kind of think of it's like

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.309 
is the word I kind of think of it's like
how<00:01:18.039> much<00:01:18.190> fabric<00:01:18.399> do<00:01:18.670> we<00:01:18.759> have<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.479> stitch

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
how much fabric do we have to stitch

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.529 
how much fabric do we have to stitch
together<00:01:20.530> our<00:01:21.159> performances<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.390> our

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
together our performances and our

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.090 
together our performances and our
understanding<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.530> world<00:01:23.679> that<00:01:23.860> we're<00:01:24.069> in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
understanding of the world that we're in

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.359 
understanding of the world that we're in
and<00:01:24.490> when<00:01:25.420> you're<00:01:25.569> in<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.840> sci-fi<00:01:26.080> story<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.159> so

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
and when you're in a sci-fi story and so

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.490 
and when you're in a sci-fi story and so
much<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.840> ultimately<00:01:28.840> left<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.380> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
much is ultimately left to the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.800 
much is ultimately left to the
imagination<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:30.280> more<00:01:31.030> practical<00:01:31.569> tangible

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
imagination the more practical tangible

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.320 
imagination the more practical tangible
things<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.709> we<00:01:32.799> have<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.069> work<00:01:33.220> with<00:01:33.429> the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
things that we have to work with the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.809 
things that we have to work with the
more<00:01:34.450> beneficial<00:01:34.959> and<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.280> with<00:01:36.429> those<00:01:36.610> guys

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
more beneficial and and with those guys

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.050 
more beneficial and and with those guys
it's<00:01:37.270> it's<00:01:37.630> really<00:01:37.899> just<00:01:38.399> tons<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.640> tons<00:01:39.670> to

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
it's it's really just tons and tons to

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's it's really just tons and tons to
work<00:01:40.180> with<00:01:40.360> it's<00:01:40.539> really<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:41.110> really<00:01:41.170> pretty

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
work with it's really it's really pretty

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.420 
work with it's really it's really pretty
remarkable
