00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.780
 Hi friends 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.570
 I am mickey and today I will show you how 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.430
 make your bicycle basket pass 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.490
 this 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.640
 to this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.010
 this was the basket of my bicycle 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 before fixing the materials that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.700
 we need are tapes any kind of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.220
 ribbons of a thickness not so small 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.769
 flowers flowers any kind of flowers 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.850
 I got these I also did some 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.250
 how are you 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.449
 any flower that you like 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.449
 the colors they want 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 We take the saint and I loved her and with my 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.110
 fingers and I did it double 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.900
 and at that distance the court like this 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.910
 shape says with all the tape 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.240
 it is important to say that after doing 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.180
 this that the tips of the tape with 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.990
 fire a lighter or anything 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.690
 so that it does not fray 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.500
 we take the tapes and introduce them into 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:30.300
 the holes that our basket has 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.620
 of the bicycle and we tie it up we make a 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.040
 simple knot so you do not skip this 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.110
 way we do it with the part of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.110
 ahead of our channel 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.380
 then we can go interspersing the tape 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.350
 with the tapes of another color 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 There, too, girls are free to their liking 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.299
 how do you want to do it? 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.720
 and in this way our character is already 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.720
 taking a little more personalized shape 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.670
 it was time to introduce the flowers 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.160
 also making the holes 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.160
 our basket we are introducing the 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.580
 flowers in such a way to make sure that 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.160
 these are not going to fall is very important 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.480
 that 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.790
 We try to engage the most my 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.810
 flowers had back to the field which 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.790
 can hook in the holes of my 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.519
 basket 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.980
 this we do with all the flowers that 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.329
 we have and we are accommodating them to our 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.700
 taste and where we see that they look better 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.950
 remember that it is very important 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.810
 hook them so that when we are 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.810
 walk do not fall 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.990
 a little 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.930
 we continue accommodating the flowers and we're going 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.720
 of the important girls is that not 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.550
 there are empty spaces and good in 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.620
 reality each one is the way that most 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.300
 he likes flowers I put the most 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 great at the end the most intimate I 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.640
 they liked it because I think that more called the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.490
 attention I put them at the end 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 there are some mistakes that I made some 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.770
 of paper other that are ceramic in 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.130
 cold and some that I bought in some 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.130
 shops 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.790
 the truth is very simple very 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.300
 entertaining and will make your bike be 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.990
 different and good also present a 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.990
 little of the others 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:32.220
 inside the basket we will be left 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.940
 all the bits of wire that 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.430
 We were introducing I was 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.220
 rolling up and putting together some of such 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 way that they will be very safe 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.980
 flowers and then cut the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.080
 and bits missing in roses 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.370
 I want that 's how it finally looks 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.370
 our basket 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.990
