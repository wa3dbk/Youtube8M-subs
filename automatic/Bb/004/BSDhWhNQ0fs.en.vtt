this<00:01:01.900> game<00:01:02.170> will<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:02.800> addition<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.280> speed

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this game will I in addition to a speed

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.200 
this game will I in addition to a speed
and<00:01:05.110> left<00:01:05.860> right<00:01:06.040> control<00:01:06.400> also<00:01:06.640> has<00:01:06.880> an<00:01:07.060> auto

and left right control also has an auto

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.999 
and left right control also has an auto
mode<00:01:07.509> so<00:01:08.050> I'm<00:01:08.110> going<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.259> put<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.530> auto<00:01:08.740> mode

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
mode so I'm going to put it in auto mode

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.410 
mode so I'm going to put it in auto mode
for<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> few<00:01:09.490> seconds<00:01:09.850> just<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.360> see

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.390 

in<00:01:18.330> auto<00:01:18.540> mode<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> computer<00:01:19.410> just<00:01:20.070> does<00:01:20.310> all

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
in auto mode the computer just does all

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.060 
in auto mode the computer just does all
the<00:01:20.550> shooting<00:01:21.380> player<00:01:22.380> doesn't<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.830> anything

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the shooting player doesn't do anything

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
the shooting player doesn't do anything
except<00:01:23.370> watch<00:01:24.080> it's<00:01:25.080> kind<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.380> interesting

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
except watch it's kind of interesting

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.320 
except watch it's kind of interesting
thing<00:01:26.010> just<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> let<00:01:26.970> run<00:01:29.180> there<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.300> a

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
thing just to let run there was a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.660 
thing just to let run there was a
parachute<00:01:30.870> diag<00:01:31.230> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.530> there's<00:01:32.100> about<00:01:32.400> or

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
parachute diag you know there's about or

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.850 
parachute diag you know there's about or
was<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:32.910> boom<00:01:33.120> I<00:01:35.570> guess<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.050> bomb

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
was that boom I guess that's a bomb

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.990 
was that boom I guess that's a bomb
dropping<00:01:39.500> our<00:01:40.500> parachutes<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.370> come<00:01:41.850> down

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
dropping our parachutes that come down

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.920 
dropping our parachutes that come down
occasionally<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.720> addition<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.230> debris

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.870 

okay<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.710> seems<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.250> slow<00:01:56.580> because

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
okay it seems kind of slow because

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
okay it seems kind of slow because
that's<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.540> auto<00:01:57.720> mode<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.260> up<00:01:58.440> ticket<00:01:58.860> out

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that's in auto mode so up ticket out

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.650 
that's in auto mode so up ticket out
auto<00:01:59.220> mode<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:01:59.790> we'll<00:01:59.940> play<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.150> game<00:02:00.390> or

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
auto mode and then we'll play a game or

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.540 
auto mode and then we'll play a game or
self<00:02:03.170> ok<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.830> we're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.310> play<00:02:05.520> it
