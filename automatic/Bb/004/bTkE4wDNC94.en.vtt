why he is one of the biggest men in in

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970 
why he is one of the biggest men in in
wrestling<00:04:52.580> history<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.830> was

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
wrestling history and so it was

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.680 
wrestling history and so it was
definitely<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.340> markup<00:04:55.669> moment<00:04:56.000> for<00:04:56.120> me<00:04:56.240> this

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
definitely a markup moment for me this

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.870 
definitely a markup moment for me this
whole<00:04:56.900> thing<00:04:57.230> was<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.620> don't<00:04:58.250> mark<00:04:58.460> out<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.640> lot

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
whole thing was I don't mark out a lot

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.040 
whole thing was I don't mark out a lot
but<00:04:59.060> this<00:04:59.150> was<00:04:59.360> definitely<00:04:59.480> one<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.900> those

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
but this was definitely one of those

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.659 
but this was definitely one of those
moments<00:05:00.290> not<00:05:00.890> to<00:05:01.010> make<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.250> video<00:05:01.400> any

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
moments not to make this video any

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.070 
moments not to make this video any
longer<00:05:02.060> because<00:05:02.180> it's<00:05:02.450> probably<00:05:02.630> not<00:05:02.990> going

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
longer because it's probably not going

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.480 
longer because it's probably not going
to<00:05:03.140> be<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.290> good<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.770> video<00:05:04.100> because<00:05:04.400> I

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
to be that good of a video because I

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.700 
to be that good of a video because I
just<00:05:04.700> kind<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.300> putting<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.690> together<00:05:05.870> but

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
just kind of putting this together but

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.440
