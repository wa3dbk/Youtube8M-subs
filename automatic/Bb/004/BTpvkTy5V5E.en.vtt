00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 a very pleasant and relaxing aroma 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.260
 through its flowers we can make a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.990
 oil that we can use with many 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.050

 massages and perfumes of great acceptance 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 Jasmine flower should always be 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.829
 harvested at night that is when it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.289
 segregates the substance that emits this smell 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.570
 so characteristic and that we like so much 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.309
 when the essence of science uses 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.769
 for oils like lavender and for a 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.410

 that really affects directly 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.970

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.120
 convinced that it can stimulate 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 sexual activity for its bearable aroma 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.460

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.940
