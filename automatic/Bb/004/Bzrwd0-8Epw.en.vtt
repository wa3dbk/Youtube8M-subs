we'll<00:00:25.150> turn<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:25.599> off<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:27.509> just<00:00:28.509> bend<00:00:28.960> down<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
we'll turn it off I just bend down and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.060 
we'll turn it off I just bend down and
we'll<00:00:31.960> try<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.680> cheaper<00:00:33.190> media<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:35.770> is<00:00:35.920> got

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
we'll try a cheaper media which is got

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.050 
we'll try a cheaper media which is got
the<00:00:36.160> disc<00:00:36.340> ID<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:36.790> amyl<00:00:37.470> never<00:00:38.470> heard<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.740> amyl

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
the disc ID of amyl never heard of amyl

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.110 
the disc ID of amyl never heard of amyl
and<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.980> see<00:00:42.160> where<00:00:42.280> tries<00:00:42.490> to<00:00:42.670> boot<00:00:42.820> this

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
and you see where tries to boot this

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.410 
and you see where tries to boot this
disc<00:00:43.390> sim<00:00:44.380> game<00:00:48.000> you'll<00:00:49.000> notice<00:00:49.240> it<00:00:49.330> has

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
disc sim game you'll notice it has

problems

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.620 

so<00:00:54.540> it<00:00:54.600> gives<00:00:54.780> them<00:00:54.840> try<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> read<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> disk<00:00:55.560> I

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
so it gives them try to read the disk I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.479 
so it gives them try to read the disk I
just<00:00:57.630> going<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.810> spin<00:00:57.989> down<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> second<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
just going to spin down in a second and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.770 
just going to spin down in a second and
got<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.790> Gamecube<00:01:00.180> menu

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.660 

alright<00:01:06.780> spun<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.520> going

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
alright spun down there and it's going

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.109 
alright spun down there and it's going
at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> GameCube<00:01:09.270> menu<00:01:10.729> if<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
at the GameCube menu if we get the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.530 
at the GameCube menu if we get the
controller<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.050> go<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> game<00:01:14.250> play<00:01:14.540> no

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

disk so what we'll do is we're going to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
disk so what we'll do is we're going to
tweak<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> pot<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> we'll<00:01:19.400> disassemble<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
tweak the pot and we'll disassemble and

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.469 
tweak the pot and we'll disassemble and
show<00:01:20.910> you<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.660> do<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
show you how to do that now so now you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
show you how to do that now so now you
can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.690> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> our<00:01:25.020> drive<00:01:25.320> pod<00:01:25.560> again<00:01:25.830> if

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

between<00:02:06.179> 180<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> 220<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.789> we're<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.030> to

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
between 180 and 220 so we're going to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.140 
between 180 and 220 so we're going to
try<00:02:09.240> set<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.690> around<00:02:09.750> 200<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.760> we

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
try set it for around 200 and do that we

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.240 
try set it for around 200 and do that we
just<00:02:12.180> turn<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> pot<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.770> just<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> screw

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
just turn the pot this is just a screw

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.270 
just turn the pot this is just a screw
so<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:14.910> turn<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.270> anti-clockwise<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.920> lower<00:02:17.099> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so we turn it anti-clockwise to lower it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760 
so we turn it anti-clockwise to lower it
and<00:02:17.430> clockwise<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.480> increase<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.620> want

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
and clockwise to increase it and we want

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.620 
and clockwise to increase it and we want
to<00:02:19.860> lower<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.520> turn<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.970> only<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.209> tiny

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to lower it but you turn it only a tiny

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.470 
to lower it but you turn it only a tiny
amount<00:02:22.020> at<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.349> time<00:02:22.880> finger<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
amount at a time finger and go so you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.110 
amount at a time finger and go so you
can<00:02:24.630> see<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.770> who's<00:02:31.980> turning<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> about<00:02:33.090> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
can see so who's turning that about a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.610 
can see so who's turning that about a
millimeter<00:02:33.630> at<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> time<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.470> retest

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
millimeter at a time and then you retest

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.300 
millimeter at a time and then you retest
sorts<00:02:37.620> retest<00:02:38.069> now

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.380 

as<00:02:42.730> at<00:02:43.150> 193<00:02:43.720> which<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:44.830> perfect<00:02:45.280> since<00:02:46.270> it

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
as at 193 which is perfect since it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.650 
as at 193 which is perfect since it
would<00:02:46.480> check<00:02:47.040> yeah<00:02:48.069> 193<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
would check yeah 193 so it's in the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.340 
would check yeah 193 so it's in the
golden<00:02:49.990> area<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.980> although<00:02:51.220> now<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:52.200> turn<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
golden area so although now is turn that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.330 
golden area so although now is turn that
what<00:02:53.590> me<00:02:53.770> trap<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.530> know<00:02:56.560> they<00:02:57.190> eat

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
what me trap just so you know they eat

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
what me trap just so you know they eat
in<00:02:57.490> your<00:02:57.520> multimeter<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.209> your<00:02:58.330> arms<00:02:58.569> I'm<00:02:58.750> a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
in your multimeter on to your arms I'm a

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.840 
in your multimeter on to your arms I'm a
resistance<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.860> have<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.580> set<00:03:00.730> in

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
resistance and you have it on the set in

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.690 
resistance and you have it on the set in
2000<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:02.680> much<00:03:02.890> easier<00:03:03.220> with<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.370> digital

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
2000 it's much easier with a digital

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.420 
2000 it's much easier with a digital
multimeter<00:03:04.020> all<00:03:05.020> right<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:05.920> let's<00:03:06.069> go<00:03:06.220> test

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
multimeter all right so let's go test

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.160 
multimeter all right so let's go test
that<00:03:06.610> now<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.180> see<00:03:07.360> if<00:03:07.420> it'll<00:03:07.540> read<00:03:07.720> our<00:03:07.870> discs

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that now and see if it'll read our discs

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.380 
that now and see if it'll read our discs
so<00:03:08.800> now<00:03:08.950> gar<00:03:09.160> GameCube<00:03:09.610> reassembled<00:03:10.000> and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
so now gar GameCube reassembled and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.150 
so now gar GameCube reassembled and
we're<00:03:10.720> going<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.900> try<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.170> cute<00:03:11.620> disc<00:03:11.830> again

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
we're going to try this cute disc again

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.940 
we're going to try this cute disc again
with<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> Amal<00:03:12.970> die<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:14.620> how<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.830> does

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
with the Amal die and see how it does

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.670 
with the Amal die and see how it does
know<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.220> pots<00:03:15.459> down<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.910> 193<00:03:16.480> which<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.290> soft

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
know the pots down to 193 which is soft

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:34.470 
know the pots down to 193 which is soft
the<00:03:17.769> perfect<00:03:18.130> area<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.430> GameCubes

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.809 

and<00:03:35.020> then<00:03:35.230> we<00:03:35.290> go<00:03:35.410> up<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:36.160> very<00:03:36.190> first<00:03:36.580> time

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and then we go up it's very first time

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.360 
and then we go up it's very first time
and<00:03:37.530> while<00:03:38.530> we're<00:03:38.620> here<00:03:38.650> we'll<00:03:39.040> just<00:03:39.099> make

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and while we're here we'll just make

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.220 
and while we're here we'll just make
sure<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.730> write<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.540> your<00:03:40.660> for<00:03:40.900> still

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
sure that I write it do your for still

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.680 
sure that I write it do your for still
boots<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.010> let's<00:03:42.129> pull<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:45.420> get<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.480> GF

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
boots so let's pull that up and get a GF

00:03:46.690 --> 00:04:02.570 
boots so let's pull that up and get a GF
our<00:03:47.019> disk<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:51.489> make<00:03:51.790> sure<00:03:51.910> that's<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.269> base

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.220 

so<00:04:03.580> they<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:03.879> it<00:04:04.000> how<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> pot<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.900> work<00:04:04.989> again

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
so they have it how a pot to work again

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.050 
so they have it how a pot to work again
