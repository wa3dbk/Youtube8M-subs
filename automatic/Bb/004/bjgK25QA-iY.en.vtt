00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
to come alive we need to hydrate it it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.799 
to come alive we need to hydrate it it
was<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.520> human<00:00:38.520> beings<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.300> even

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
was just like a human beings or even

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.880 
alive keep themselves alive same
principle<00:00:47.579> works<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.050> statue<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
principle works for a statue which is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
principle works for a statue which is
also<00:00:50.660> alive<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:52.559> every<00:00:53.190> statue<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
also alive because every statue that is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
also alive because every statue that is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.480 
come alive so it's it's a science it's
not<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.720> superstition<00:01:48.720> where<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.250> dump<00:01:50.250> all

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
now I want to talk a little bit about

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.130 
now I want to talk a little bit about
this<00:02:06.509> particular

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
this particular

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.330 
this particular
Dancing's<00:02:09.520> shivers<00:02:10.990> hydration<00:02:11.990> it<00:02:12.980> takes

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
Dancing's shivers hydration it takes

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.620 
Dancing's shivers hydration it takes
place<00:02:13.900> six<00:02:14.900> times<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.560> year<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.970> time<00:02:17.270> has

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
place six times in a year the time has

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.730 
place six times in a year the time has
been<00:02:18.310> sacred<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.750> energy<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.320> she<00:02:21.560> were

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
been sacred for the energy of she were

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.760 
been sacred for the energy of she were
to<00:02:21.980> come<00:02:22.250> into<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.060> earth<00:02:23.360> plane<00:02:23.770> otherwise

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
to come into the earth plane otherwise

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.320 
to come into the earth plane otherwise
there<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.310> no<00:02:26.110> reason<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:28.209> perform<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
there is no reason to perform the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.100 
there is no reason to perform the
hydration<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.230> particular<00:02:31.570> time<00:02:32.570> so

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
hydration on this particular time so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.660 
hydration on this particular time so
time<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.680> importance<00:02:34.600> guards<00:02:35.600> are<00:02:36.670> forms

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
time is of importance guards are forms

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.720 
time is of importance guards are forms
of<00:02:37.760> energy<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:38.900> they<00:02:39.440> come<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:40.370> only

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
of energy and then they come here only

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.680 
of energy and then they come here only
at<00:02:41.090> certain<00:02:41.510> time<00:02:42.260> like<00:02:42.760> Ganesa<00:02:43.760> comes<00:02:44.239> on<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
at certain time like Ganesa comes on the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.320 
at certain time like Ganesa comes on the
fourth<00:02:44.989> moon<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.890> Muruga<00:02:46.610> comes<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.180> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
fourth moon and Muruga comes on the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.470 
fourth moon and Muruga comes on the
sixth<00:02:47.720> moon<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.280> goddesses<00:02:49.820> come<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.300> the

sixth moon and the goddesses come on the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.890 
sixth moon and the goddesses come on the
fifth<00:02:50.720> moon<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.739> these<00:02:52.730> are<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:53.090> very

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
fifth moon and these are all very

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.570 
fifth moon and these are all very
important<00:02:54.550> timings<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:55.910> this<00:02:56.530> hydration<00:02:57.580> time

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
important timings so this hydration time

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.040 
important timings so this hydration time
