00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
getting back to Mega Man Battle Network

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.289 
getting back to Mega Man Battle Network
three<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:10.980> let's<00:00:11.010> get<00:00:11.430> right<00:00:11.610> back<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.089> it<00:00:12.179> and

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
three so let's get right back to it and

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.820 
three so let's get right back to it and
head<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.629> the<00:00:12.750> second<00:00:13.080> part<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.440> secret

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
head to the second part of the secret

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.640 
head to the second part of the secret
area<00:00:14.570> starting<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:15.750> here<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> aura

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
area starting right here from the aura

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
area starting right here from the aura
in<00:00:16.950> the<00:00:17.460> server<00:00:17.730> room<00:00:17.850> because<00:00:18.360> well<00:00:18.570> why<00:00:18.960> not

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
in the server room because well why not

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.980 
in the server room because well why not
we<00:00:19.830> know<00:00:19.980> how<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.520> by<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
we know how to get here by now so it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
we know how to get here by now so it
seemed<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> most<00:00:22.470> convenient<00:00:22.950> starting

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
seemed the most convenient starting

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.750 
seemed the most convenient starting
location<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.830> still<00:00:29.010> occasionally<00:00:29.310> been

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
location so it's still occasionally been

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.850 
location so it's still occasionally been
getting<00:00:30.090> people<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.720> want<00:00:31.350> me<00:00:31.440> to<00:00:31.530> cut<00:00:31.710> out

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
getting people that want me to cut out

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.729 
getting people that want me to cut out
virus<00:00:32.279> battles<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.140> they<00:00:34.140> seem<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
virus battles and they seem to have this

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
virus battles and they seem to have this
theory<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.129> if<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.460> did<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.940> I'd<00:00:36.210> be

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
theory that if I did that I'd be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.830 
theory that if I did that I'd be
uploading<00:00:36.990> faster<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:38.670> simple<00:00:38.970> fact<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
uploading faster the simple fact is it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.710 
uploading faster the simple fact is it
would<00:00:40.260> probably<00:00:40.500> take<00:00:40.770> me<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.270> yeah<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
would probably take me but yeah so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.810 
would probably take me but yeah so
basically<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.220> style<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
basically you know this is my style I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.490 
basically you know this is my style I
just<00:00:45.120> show<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.630> virus<00:00:45.900> battles<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:46.470> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
just show the virus battles that I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.740 
just show the virus battles that I
encounter<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.310> my<00:00:47.520> main<00:00:48.120> trip<00:00:48.450> through<00:00:48.720> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
encounter on my main trip through the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
encounter on my main trip through the
game<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.320> seems<00:00:49.650> perfectly<00:00:50.160> legitimate<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
game which seems perfectly legitimate to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.920 
game which seems perfectly legitimate to
make<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> anyway<00:00:52.380> here's<00:00:53.040> area<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.930> that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
make but anyway here's area to that

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
make but anyway here's area to that
which<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.320> real<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.920> only<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
which is real is not only that what you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.900 
which is real is not only that what you
see<00:00:56.880> do<00:00:57.630> not<00:00:57.660> forget<00:00:58.110> that<00:00:58.790> basically<00:00:59.790> what

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
see do not forget that basically what

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.210 
see do not forget that basically what
he's<00:01:00.030> saying<00:01:00.060> is<00:01:00.540> there's<00:01:01.380> hidden<00:01:01.590> passages

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
he's saying is there's hidden passages

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.520 
he's saying is there's hidden passages
all<00:01:02.460> over<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> place<00:01:03.059> yeah<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> rather

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
all over the place yeah this is a rather

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
all over the place yeah this is a rather
convoluted<00:01:04.949> area

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.069 

so<00:01:10.890> let's<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.219> we've<00:01:11.399> got<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.719> so<00:01:12.719> as<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> was

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
so let's see we've got a so as I was

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.539 
so let's see we've got a so as I was
saying<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.680> ignore<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.130> wart

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
saying we're gonna ignore that wart

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.819 
saying we're gonna ignore that wart
panel<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.180> we'll<00:01:15.420> come<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> later<00:01:16.110> for

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
panel for now we'll come to it later for

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.330 
panel for now we'll come to it later for
now<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.130> break<00:01:17.340> another<00:01:17.549> monolith<00:01:19.340> its

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
now let's break another monolith its

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.169 
now let's break another monolith its
endurance<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:22.700> beefing<00:01:23.700> him<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> an

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
endurance time beefing him up to an

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.149 
endurance time beefing him up to an
omega-level<00:01:24.539> virus<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.710> still<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.039> gonna

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
omega-level virus it's still not gonna

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300 
omega-level virus it's still not gonna
do<00:01:26.369> much<00:01:27.409> ugly<00:01:28.409> there's<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:28.799> big<00:01:29.039> square

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
do much ugly there's this big square

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
do much ugly there's this big square
down<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.630> seem<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.049> have

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
down here that doesn't seem to have

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.980 
down here that doesn't seem to have
anything<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.210> think<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> had<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> one

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
anything on it I think I had that one

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.429 
anything on it I think I had that one
yet<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:35.210> let's<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.630> warp<00:01:36.899> panel<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
yet so let's take this warp panel and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
yet so let's take this warp panel and
see<00:01:37.649> where<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:41.509> coming<00:01:42.509> down<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.020> have

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
see where we go coming down here we have

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
see where we go coming down here we have
another<00:01:43.349> ghost<00:01:43.619> Navi<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.250> bug<00:01:44.819> fracked

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
another ghost Navi here bug fracked

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
another ghost Navi here bug fracked
Raider<00:01:45.390> 300<00:01:46.250> yeah<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.549> doesn't<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.030> mean

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
Raider 300 yeah that doesn't really mean

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.760 
Raider 300 yeah that doesn't really mean
much<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.899 

now<00:01:53.340> let's<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.729> down<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.150> side<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.700> may

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
now let's go down the right side you may

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.350 
now let's go down the right side you may
pass

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
pass

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.690 
pass
