spots sit at different intervals apart

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.359 
spots sit at different intervals apart
there's<00:01:23.869> not<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.080> line<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.650> spots<00:01:24.890> system<00:01:25.280> what

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
there's not a line of spots system what

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.620 
there's not a line of spots system what
they<00:01:25.520> actually<00:01:25.670> three<00:01:26.119> there's<00:01:26.300> one<00:01:26.450> very

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
they actually three there's one very

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
faint one when slightly bigger one and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.450 
faint one when slightly bigger one and
then<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.660> fairly<00:01:30.260> large<00:01:30.500> spot<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.130> what<00:01:31.250> one

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
then a fairly large spot and what one

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.730 
then a fairly large spot and what one
does<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.970> can't<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.020> top<00:01:33.229> row<00:01:33.260> spots

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
does is you can't on that top row spots

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.040 
does is you can't on that top row spots
you<00:01:33.860> can't<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.970> number<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.510> spots<00:01:35.780> where

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
you can't the number of spots where

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.120 
you can't the number of spots where
there's<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.369> super<00:01:37.369> see<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> spot<00:01:38.860> above<00:01:39.860> that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
there's a super see a spot above that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.740 
there's a super see a spot above that
line<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.509> from<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:41.930> can<00:01:42.080> see<00:01:42.290> there's<00:01:42.890> that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
line so from what I can see there's that

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.580 
line so from what I can see there's that
is<00:01:44.750> close<00:01:44.930> as<00:01:45.110> you<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.290> get<00:01:45.410> here<00:01:50.470> we're<00:01:51.470> going

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
that this may be the nose the fact that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.809 
that this may be the nose the fact that
it's<00:02:08.300> mottled<00:02:08.899> like<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.069> is<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.580> give<00:02:10.729> us

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
it's mottled like it is that can give us

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.640 
it's mottled like it is that can give us
