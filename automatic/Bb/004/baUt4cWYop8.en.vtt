reviewing checked this light bulb is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.799 
reviewing checked this light bulb is
because<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.650> dimmable<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
because it's dimmable and it's a

candelabra styled light bulb I like how

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
candelabra styled light bulb I like how
its<00:00:15.719> frosted<00:00:16.230> because<00:00:16.590> then<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.920> can't<00:00:17.160> see

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
its frosted because then you can't see

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.250 
its frosted because then you can't see
the<00:00:17.520> filament<00:00:17.970> right<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:19.109> of

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the filament right you can see a lot of

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
the filament right you can see a lot of
candelabra<00:00:20.160> light<00:00:20.580> bulbs<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
candelabra light bulbs which kind of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.230 
candelabra light bulbs which kind of
takes<00:00:22.470> away<00:00:22.590> from<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.100> effect<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
takes away from the effect of like a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.359 
takes away from the effect of like a
flame<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:25.710> trying<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.160> with

flame that you're trying to get with

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.290 
flame that you're trying to get with
these<00:00:26.550> kind<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.880> light<00:00:27.000> bulbs<00:00:29.090> this<00:00:30.090> light

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
these kind of light bulbs this light

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.069 
these kind of light bulbs this light
bulb<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> LED<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> lot<00:00:32.250> more

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
bulb because it is LED it is a lot more

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
bulb because it is LED it is a lot more
environmentally<00:00:34.079> friendly<00:00:35.239> nice<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
environmentally friendly nice and it's a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
environmentally friendly nice and it's a
lot<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.530> economical<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.270> light

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
lot more economical because this light

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.389 
lot more economical because this light
bulb<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.610> twenty<00:00:41.610> thousand<00:00:43.100> kilowatt<00:00:44.100> hours

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
bulb is twenty thousand kilowatt hours

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.350 
bulb is twenty thousand kilowatt hours
but<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.289> where<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.789> light

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
but that's that one where as a light

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.779 
but that's that one where as a light
bulb<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.140> regular<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.520> per

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
bulb the regular kind you can get per

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
bulb the regular kind you can get per
candelabra<00:00:51.480> white<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:53.030> only<00:00:54.030> two<00:00:54.660> thousand<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
candelabra white is only two thousand so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
candelabra white is only two thousand so
this<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.350> ten<00:00:58.350> times<00:00:59.449> like<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
this one is ten times like the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.619 
this one is ten times like the
equivalent<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.590> turning<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:02.480> so<00:01:03.480> that's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
equivalent of turning these so that's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
equivalent of turning these so that's
nice<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.470> put<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:05.070> perspective

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
nice and to put this into perspective

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
nice and to put this into perspective
for<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> who<00:01:08.280> don't<00:01:08.790> really<00:01:09.470> understand

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
for you who don't really understand

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.899 
for you who don't really understand
kilowatt<00:01:11.010> hours<00:01:13.220> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.369> were<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.729> your

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
kilowatt hours if you were to have your

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.890 
kilowatt hours if you were to have your
lights<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.200> 24/7<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:18.060> light<00:01:18.390> bulb<00:01:18.630> would

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
lights on for 24/7 this light bulb would

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.770 
lights on for 24/7 this light bulb would
only<00:01:19.049> last<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> three<00:01:19.860> days<00:01:20.430> whereas<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
only last you a three days whereas this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
only last you a three days whereas this
one<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.710> last<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.750> 833<00:01:24.750> days<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.490> have

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
one would last you 833 days so you have

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
one would last you 833 days so you have
the<00:01:26.820> difference<00:01:27.180> between<00:01:27.420> less<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.350> three

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
the difference between less than three

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.140 
the difference between less than three
months<00:01:28.799> versus<00:01:29.780> two<00:01:30.780> years<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> three<00:01:31.500> months

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
months versus two years and three months

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.340 
months versus two years and three months
so<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> will<00:01:33.540> save<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> money<00:01:34.229> at

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
so this will save you a lot of money at

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.620 
so this will save you a lot of money at
malama<00:01:35.390> I'm<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> show<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> guys<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
malama I'm going to show you guys a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
malama I'm going to show you guys a
comparison<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> lights<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.310> way

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
comparison with the lights on the way

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.899 
comparison with the lights on the way
bulbs<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.810> uh<00:01:43.430> let<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
bulbs on and uh let you see the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.640 
bulbs on and uh let you see the
difference<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.509> brightness

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.070 

that<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.400> LED<00:01:51.850> light<00:01:52.060> was<00:01:52.300> in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.600> forefront

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
that the LED light was in the forefront

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that the LED light was in the forefront
of<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.410> video<00:01:53.650> whereas<00:01:54.550> this<00:01:55.000> was<00:01:55.240> still<00:01:55.420> left

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of the video whereas this was still left

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.770 
of the video whereas this was still left
I<00:01:57.100> think<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.730> you<00:01:57.820> can<00:01:58.000> tell<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.390> there<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
I think that you can tell that there is

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.350 
I think that you can tell that there is
a<00:01:59.190> big<00:02:00.190> difference<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.090> brightness

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
a big difference and the brightness

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.250 
a big difference and the brightness
between<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:02.020> two<00:02:02.730> on<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:04.000> video<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:05.050> hope

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
between the two on the video and I hope

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.639 
between the two on the video and I hope
you<00:02:05.410> can<00:02:05.560> see<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.750> I<00:02:08.050> just<00:02:08.229> want<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> thank
