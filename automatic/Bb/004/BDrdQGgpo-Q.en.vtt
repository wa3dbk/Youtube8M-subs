00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.770
 There she is finally the smart watch 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.030
 samsung galaxy here to ifa 2013 for 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.280
 first time to see 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.110
 no fear the display is not only 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.760
 black white it is a 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.400
 super amoled and poses 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.350
 of course also colors though 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.540
 the black pixel with this technology 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.699
 no energy can be needed 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.400
 Save a lot of precious electricity 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.610
 The display has a resolution of 320x 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.120
 320 pixels at a diagonal of 16 3 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.790
 inch what a pixel density of 278 pp 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.670
 corresponds and it is nice and sharp 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.739
 Here's a quick look at the bracelet 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.680
 Plastic has a bulge in it 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.750
 The lens of the camera hides with it 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.900
 but you can also swap it clearly 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:15.909
 So do not watch the bracelet and better 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.130
 have no allergy beats inside 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.940
 the heart of the clock is a processor with 800 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.420
 megahertz 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.100
 there are 512 megabytes of RAM and 4 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.860
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.520
 on the bottom are the contacts to 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.050
 guess 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.080
 over the the internal battery again 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.960
 is charged and there are 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.570
 microphone and speaker lack of sim 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.310
 card slot and funkmodul goes the galaxy 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.820
 but not as an independent one 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 mobile phone but as bluetooth 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.450
 speakerphone 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.340
 if that is so practicable after all 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.580
 you have to have a cellphone anyway 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.580
 to have 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.540
 When creating the clock behaves like 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.850
 It should be like a clock 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.250
 it is a bit heavier than normal 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.050
 timekeeper feels but because of the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.060
 rather soft plastic from that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.060
 Bracelet is made very good 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.630
 By the way, the camera is an old one 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.070
 known here comes the exact same 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.560
 modules for use 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.640
 which also has the galaxy s 4 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 but on the front speak 19 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.250
 megapixel the taking of photos and 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.690
 Videos are possible directly on the camera 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.240
 a swipe gesture starts the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.090
 corresponding application tap triggers 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.830
 from the car sound we could 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.900
 not switch off maybe that's it 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.730
 intention to secret receptive to 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.860
 prevent 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.450
 the recording of video clips is possible 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.650
 however, no longer than 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.630
 take ten seconds 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.670
 after all, the results must be yes 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.090
 also transferred via bluetooth to the mobile phone 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.950
 become 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.020
 Other applications include the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.290
 phone app as a remote control for the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.930
 cell phone the contact lists call lists 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.060
 Samsung's own messenger chaton as well 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.840
 bungie for access to social 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.270
 networks or the notebook evernote im 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.350
 later course, it should be 80 different 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.970
 give apps for the smart watch 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.160
 the bad news and that there is one 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.519
 really bad news for the operation 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.890
 the clock is a galaxy note 3 needed and 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.790
 nothing else 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.920
 maybe it works with the times 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 galaxy s 4 was confirmed but 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.600
 Not 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.120
 to the configuration is namely a 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.490
 special app currently only needed 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.470
 on the note 3 is running 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.980
 about it can be, for example, the skin of the clock 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.980
 establish 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.000
 the galaxy greed is probably in the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.060
 come fourth quarter to the market and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.849
 cost between 250 and 300 euros 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.870
 the first impression nice but you can 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.610
 even without life 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.799
 after all, there are different 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.610
 color variants with partly gaudy 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.610
 excesses
