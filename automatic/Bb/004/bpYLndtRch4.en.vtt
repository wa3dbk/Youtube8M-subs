00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 in this video we are going to solve a 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.170
 riddle proposed in the section of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.410
 mathematical puzzles that you find 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.590
 in tasks plus dotcom we have the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 next riddle together dog and cat 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.689
 weigh 15 kilos if the weight of the can is a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.760
 odd number and also the male weighs the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.920
 twice as much as the female weighs each 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.130
 to solve this, let's look at what 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.190
 next the weight of the can is a number 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 odd let's put here the can that is 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 the dog 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.510
 and here the cat 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.590
 now this has to be an odd number 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.890
 and also the male weighs twice as much as 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 female and the male weighs twice as much as 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.410
 female after was heavy for something 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.870
 would be double in this case the male 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.290
 would be an even number, so in this 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.320
 case the male would be a cat and the female 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.320
 it would be the dog this cat would be the male 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.039
 since the male is always going to get a 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.399
 number pair now the can must be the 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.399
 female 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.580
 that we need to find the weight of each 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.440
 one but that we already know we see by 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.970
 example x the weight of the can 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.970
 that is the weight of the dog 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.340
 Now we know that the dog is female 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.290
 and that the male is the cat and they tell us 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.870
 that the male weighs twice as much as the female 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 so twice the weight of the dog goes 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.700
 to be equal to the weight of the cat 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 now they tell us that together they weigh 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.700
 15 kilos is to say that x is the weight 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.979
 of the dog plus 2x which is the weight of the cat 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.950
 it will be equal to 15 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.380
 and let's solve this equation we have to 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.000
 x2 x is 3x 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.460
 and this will be equal to 15 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.780
 where we have got this 3 a 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:29.940
 divide and we are left here that x is going to be 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 equal to 15 over 3 so x is going to be 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 equal to 5 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.080
 that is, the weight of the dog is 5 kilos 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.360
 and that of the 10 kilos cat 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.280
 and that's where our riddle was solved 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.890
