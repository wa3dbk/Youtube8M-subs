00:00:01.045 --> 00:00:05.844
 Eleven Elf Elf, a great day for a mathematical brain, 

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:09.776
 and I want to say first of all that there is nothing really specific about this date, 

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.148
 but it's interesting to take the 1's so short, which happens once in a century. 

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:17.423
 There are a few things that do come up when we think of the number 11, 

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:19.754
 and especially, "one-on-one" 

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:24.425
 First - Genesis 1: 1 - In the beginning, God made Heaven and earth. 

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.938
 We see this as the summary of creation. 

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:33.700
 We see that God is our wonderful and creative God who provides us with new beginnings, and that is still true today. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.270
 He provides us with new beginnings through Jesus. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.309
 John 1: 1 - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.589
 the following versions ... The same was in the beginning with God, 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.382
 as well as "everything was made by him, 

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.851
 and without Him was nothing made not of Him, ' 

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:55.517
 Eleven verses after that, "The Word was made flesh and came to stay with us" 

00:00:55.517 --> 00:01:01.095
 We see that Jesus came as a sacrifice for our sins. He led a perfect, sinless, life, 

00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:04.164
 and He gives us new beginnings through faith in Him. 

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.805
 We can also take some lessons from the eleven, 

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:10.501
 and specifically, some negative examples we should not follow. 

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:14.888
 There were 11 rulers in the Old Testament who were pointed out as angry with God's prophets 

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:16.689
 when they brought His message. 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.823
 Let us not be so! Hebrews warn us so many times, "don't harden your hearts!" 

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.920
 So let us not be like Pharaoh, Herod, Balak or Zedekiah - 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.258
 let us always keep humble hearts before God, always focused on His voice, focused on the guidance of His Holy Spirit, 

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.460
 and let us live in His blessings. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.857
 Or what about the Twelve disciples who chose Jesus, only eleven remained faithful, 

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:43.003
 and some people will say that Jesus was a failure because He chose Judas Iscariot as His disciple ... 

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:48.008
 Not so! It is very clear that Jesus had a sovereign plan in it. 

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.057
 In Mark, there is a theme of "Disciple Failure" - 

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:57.118
 and the disciples, before Pentecost (before they received the Holy Spirit), did not understand everything about what Jesus said, did or predicted. 

00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:01.447
 Jesus said, "The Son of man must be betrayed into the hands of sinners and sacrificed ..." 

00:02:01.447 --> 00:02:06.055
 "And give his life a ransom for many, and then he will rise on the third day!" 

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:09.196
 And He told them it, but they missed it completely sometimes! 

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:13.531
 But we see here that Jesus knew what He was doing, even in choosing Judas Iscariot ... 

00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.036
 but the lesson here - don't be a Judas! 

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:21.509
 So many times we want to be a John and lay our heads on Jesus' breast, and be so close to Him, 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:29.383
 but instead we are a Judas and betray Him in our sin. Let us repent! Let's follow Jesus and love Him, more every day. 

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:35.222
 So I'll say, "Grab the Day," but I'd rather say, 'Carpe Diem pro Iesus' 

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.683
 Grab the Day for Jesus. 

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.961
 And in the last 11 seconds of this video, you may want to find a place to pray, 

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:44.197
 to devote your life to the Lord, to purify your heart before Him, 

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:48.756
 and may the Holy Spirit enable you, no matter how ordinary or extraordinary the date is, 

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:53.782
 to do what He has for you "Today" - God bless you!
