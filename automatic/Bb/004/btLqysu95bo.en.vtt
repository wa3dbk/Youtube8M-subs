and when you use the spring compressor

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.270 
and when you use the spring compressor
tool<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:25.360> valve<00:01:25.660> will<00:01:26.440> not<00:01:26.470> fall<00:01:26.920> into<00:01:27.160> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
tool the valve will not fall into the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.150 
tool the valve will not fall into the
head<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.080> do<00:01:29.200> not<00:01:29.380> use<00:01:29.740> an<00:01:29.890> air<00:01:30.009> compressor

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
head if you do not use an air compressor

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.010 
head if you do not use an air compressor
and<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.850> take<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.060> spring<00:01:31.450> off<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.810> valve

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and you take that spring off the valve

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.109 
and you take that spring off the valve
will<00:01:32.259> fall<00:01:32.470> into<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.740> cylinder<00:01:33.160> and<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.369> then

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
will fall into the cylinder and you then

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.880 
will fall into the cylinder and you then
have<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.450> take<00:01:34.509> apart<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.050> entire<00:01:35.350> head<00:01:35.560> which

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
have to take apart the entire head which

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.050 
have to take apart the entire head which
means<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.190> got<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.400> take<00:01:36.520> off<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> exhaust

this<00:02:04.690> is<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.110> how-to<00:02:05.380> for<00:02:05.860> valve<00:02:06.069> seals<00:02:07.440> if

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
this is the how-to for valve seals if

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.040 
this is the how-to for valve seals if
you<00:02:08.560> don't<00:02:08.710> want<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.890> take<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.160> head<00:02:09.280> off<00:02:09.429> or

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you don't want to take the head off or

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.900 
you don't want to take the head off or
if<00:02:11.050> you're<00:02:11.470> in<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.250> middle<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.640> regular

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
if you're in the middle of a regular

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
if you're in the middle of a regular
project<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.780> you're<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.020> doing<00:02:14.230> some<00:02:14.500> sort

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
project and you're not doing some sort

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.380 
project and you're not doing some sort
of<00:02:14.709> super<00:02:14.950> engine<00:02:15.160> work<00:02:15.310> I'm<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> change

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
of super engine work I'm going to change

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.890 
of super engine work I'm going to change
the<00:02:16.480> valve<00:02:16.660> seals<00:02:18.090> keep<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> head<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.480> take

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the valve seals keep the head on take

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.290 
the valve seals keep the head on take
the<00:02:19.990> spark<00:02:20.230> plug<00:02:20.380> out<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.590> hole<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.150> from

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the spark plug out the hole this is from

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.809 
the spark plug out the hole this is from
a<00:02:22.330> compression<00:02:22.870> tester<00:02:23.200> kit<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:24.130> fitting<00:02:24.490> an

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
a compression tester kit the fitting an

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.520 
a compression tester kit the fitting an
air<00:02:25.000> fitting<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.260> threads<00:02:27.630> take<00:02:28.630> it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
air fitting and as threads take it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.100 
air fitting and as threads take it
put<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.620> right<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.920> spark<00:02:32.220> plug<00:02:32.400> hole

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
put it right in the spark plug hole

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
put it right in the spark plug hole
screw<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.290> bad<00:02:34.470> boy<00:02:34.680> into<00:02:34.860> place<00:02:41.180> nice<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
screw that bad boy into place nice and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.740 
screw that bad boy into place nice and
tight<00:02:47.450> okay

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
tight okay

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.500 
tight okay
then<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.350> plug<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.710> your<00:02:49.740> air<00:02:49.920> compressor

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
then you plug up your air compressor

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:02.710 
then you plug up your air compressor
obviously<00:02:51.510> I've<00:02:51.630> got<00:02:51.750> one

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.010 

yeah

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.540 

now<00:03:07.020> all<00:03:07.410> that's<00:03:07.530> doing<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.890> you're<00:03:08.040> pumping

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
now all that's doing is you're pumping

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.490 
now all that's doing is you're pumping
the<00:03:08.640> cylinder<00:03:08.940> full<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.180> air<00:03:09.410> turn<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the cylinder full of air turn the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.410 
the cylinder full of air turn the
compressor<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:12.269> then<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.450> put<00:03:12.629> your<00:03:14.420> your

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
compressor on and then you put your your

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.690 
compressor on and then you put your your
valve<00:03:15.660> spring<00:03:16.050> compressor<00:03:16.080> tool<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:17.519> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
valve spring compressor tool on the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.300 
valve spring compressor tool on the
spring<00:03:18.800> lift<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.920> up

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310

press<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.300> spring<00:03:21.420> then<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.750> hit<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:21.959> with

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
press the spring then you hit this with

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.130 
press the spring then you hit this with
a<00:03:22.140> hammer<00:03:22.319> spray<00:03:23.160> will<00:03:23.280> go<00:03:23.370> down<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:24.690> take<00:03:24.959> out

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
a hammer spray will go down you take out

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.320 
a hammer spray will go down you take out
your<00:03:25.349> peepers<00:03:26.340> there's<00:03:26.880> two<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.150> them<00:03:27.239> in
