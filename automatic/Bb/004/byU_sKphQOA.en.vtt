a colleague of mine that I studied with

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.410 
a colleague of mine that I studied with
a<00:00:57.780> long<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.680> wires<00:01:00.020> it<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.760> torn<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a long time some wires it can be torn it

can<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.809> cut<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.260> knife<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.189> it's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
can be cut with a knife but and it's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
can be cut with a knife but and it's
literally<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> continuum<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.500> end<00:01:07.650> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
literally a continuum from one end to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
literally a continuum from one end to
the<00:01:07.770> other<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.369> thing<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> say<00:01:09.119> very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the other one thing I think to say very

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.350 
the other one thing I think to say very
simple<00:01:09.930> terms<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.880> students<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.970> clients<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
simple terms to students and clients and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.609 
simple terms to students and clients and
what-have-you<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> were<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
what-have-you is that if you were to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
what-have-you is that if you were to
disappear<00:01:13.979> with<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> body<00:01:14.700> tissue<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
disappear with the body tissue and just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.870 
disappear with the body tissue and just
leave<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> fashio<00:01:16.080> behind<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.490> would<00:01:17.610> look<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
leave the fashio behind you would look a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.719 
leave the fashio behind you would look a
little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.450> loofah<00:01:18.750> shape<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
little bit like a loofah shape like you

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.270 
little bit like a loofah shape like you
so<00:01:20.729> there'll<00:01:20.939> be<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.240> 3d<00:01:21.869> webbing<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so there'll be this 3d webbing that you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340 
so there'll be this 3d webbing that you
would<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.820> organized<00:01:24.600> though<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
would look like organized though in

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
would look like organized though in
various<00:01:25.710> shapes<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> wraps<00:01:26.580> around

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
various shapes because it wraps around

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
various shapes because it wraps around
every<00:01:27.150> single<00:01:27.330> part<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> makes<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
every single part of you makes like the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
every single part of you makes like the
shape<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> bones<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.700> also<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> structure

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
shape of bones it's also the structure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.080 
shape of bones it's also the structure
inside<00:01:30.780> bone<00:01:31.340> makes<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> shape<00:01:32.909> of

structure and organ that you can

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.810 
structure and organ that you can
consider<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.659> penetrates<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.470> well

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
consider and it penetrates them as well

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.429 
consider and it penetrates them as well
lots<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.970> recent<00:01:48.570> studies<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.049> shown<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
lots of recent studies have shown that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.859 
lots of recent studies have shown that
it's

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
it's

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's
neurologically<00:01:51.869> innovative<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.040> it's

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
neurologically innovative so it's

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.240 
neurologically innovative so it's
sensory<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.119> internal<00:01:54.450> skin<00:01:55.250> this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sensory it's like an internal skin this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
sensory it's like an internal skin this
becomes<00:01:56.610> skin<00:01:56.880> because<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.360> cut<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.659> away

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
becomes skin because you can cut it away

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
becomes skin because you can cut it away
but<00:01:58.380> actually<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.920> part<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.369> whole<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
but actually it's part of a whole when I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.490 
but actually it's part of a whole when I
pull<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.270> I'm<00:02:00.420> putting<00:02:00.750> all<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.200> pressure

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
pull it I'm putting all that pressure

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.340 
pull it I'm putting all that pressure
and<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.460> webbing<00:02:02.880> penetrates<00:02:03.540> through<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and that webbing penetrates through the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.959

little<00:02:04.560> pock<00:02:04.770> marks<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> shapes

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
little pock marks you see in the shapes

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.969 
little pock marks you see in the shapes

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
of your skin it's come from the web
that's<00:02:08.190> underneath<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.750> penetrates

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's underneath it and that penetrates

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.380 
that's underneath it and that penetrates
you<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.950> followed<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> downwards<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you if you followed it downwards it just

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.110 
you if you followed it downwards it just
goes<00:02:12.540> all<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.780> way

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
goes all the way

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.339 
goes all the way
through<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.420> around<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> structures

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
through and around all the structures

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.320 
through and around all the structures
underneath<00:02:14.650> right<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.640> way<00:02:15.760> down<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:16.120> bone

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
underneath right the way down to bone

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.930

and<00:02:16.780> penetrates<00:02:17.349> into<00:02:17.530> bone<00:02:17.799> as<00:02:17.950> well<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.790> it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and penetrates into bone as well so it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.970 
and penetrates into bone as well so it's
connected<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.450> every<00:02:19.840> possible<00:02:20.080> way<00:02:20.379> that<00:02:20.860> you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
connected in every possible way that you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.390 
connected in every possible way that you
can<00:02:21.159> consider<00:02:22.349> different<00:02:23.349> densities<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
can consider different densities to it

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.390 
can consider different densities to it
it's<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.390> sheets<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.959> planes<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.739> cubes<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
it's in sheets and planes and cubes and

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.369 
it's in sheets and planes and cubes and
pouches<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.000> more<00:02:28.330> heavy<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.260> it's

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
pouches and more heavy but it's

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.180 
pouches and more heavy but it's
influenced<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.010> lot<00:02:30.220> by<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:31.720> behavior<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:33.099> know

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
influenced a lot by by behavior you know

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670 
influenced a lot by by behavior you know
a<00:02:33.400> shape<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.599> shapes<00:02:34.870> us<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.349> we<00:02:35.500> can

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
a shape and it shapes us and we can

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.039 
a shape and it shapes us and we can
shape<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.159> at<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.489> same<00:02:36.700> time

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
shape it at the same time

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.210 
shape it at the same time
I'm<00:02:38.049> guessing<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.440> pretty<00:02:38.650> important<00:02:39.040> for

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
I'm guessing it's pretty important for

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.059 
I'm guessing it's pretty important for
yoga<00:02:39.849> martial<00:02:40.450> arts<00:02:40.840> weightlifting<00:02:41.470> bodywork

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
yoga martial arts weightlifting bodywork

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.119 
yoga martial arts weightlifting bodywork
so<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.579> mean<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:43.209> know<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:43.540> if<00:02:44.409> you<00:02:44.769> didn't

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
so I mean you know it's if you didn't

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.030 
so I mean you know it's if you didn't
have<00:02:45.250> muscle<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.780> fashion<00:02:47.079> structure

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
have muscle in your fashion structure

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.780 
have muscle in your fashion structure
then<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.569> not<00:02:49.720> gonna<00:02:49.930> move<00:02:50.489> can't<00:02:51.489> just<00:02:51.670> have

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
then it's not gonna move can't just have

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.160 
then it's not gonna move can't just have
the<00:02:51.819> fashion<00:02:52.120> things<00:02:52.599> everyone's<00:02:52.959> coming

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the fashion things everyone's coming

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.080 
the fashion things everyone's coming
fashion<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.400> put<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.790> there<00:02:54.970> and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
fashion that and you put it there and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.970 
fashion that and you put it there and
stand<00:02:55.359> up<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.599> its<00:02:55.750> own<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.049> won't<00:02:56.230> move<00:02:56.379> it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
stand up on its own it won't move it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.890 
stand up on its own it won't move it
needs<00:02:57.190> something<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.670> engage<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.599> it<00:02:58.659> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
needs something to engage with it and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.479 
needs something to engage with it and
contract<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.680> there<00:02:59.799> must<00:02:59.890> be<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.099> structure

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
contract it so there must be a structure

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.170 
contract it so there must be a structure
pulls<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.909> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
pulls on it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.599 
pulls on it
so<00:03:01.480> there's<00:03:01.629> considerations<00:03:02.319> now<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.890> most

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
so there's considerations now that most

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.460 
so there's considerations now that most
of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.879> kinetic<00:03:04.359> storing<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.049> loading

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
of the kinetic storing and the loading

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.460 
of the kinetic storing and the loading
will<00:03:06.459> be<00:03:06.609> more<00:03:07.000> through<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.720> fascial<00:03:08.079> Network

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
will be more through the fascial Network

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.289 
will be more through the fascial Network
so<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:08.829> know<00:03:09.010> towards<00:03:09.400> tendons<00:03:09.819> more<00:03:10.090> heavy

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
so you know towards tendons more heavy

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.030 
so you know towards tendons more heavy
so<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.629> muscles<00:03:10.989> are<00:03:11.109> acting<00:03:11.379> on<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.620> tendons

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
so the muscles are acting on the tendons

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.789 
so the muscles are acting on the tendons
to<00:03:12.310> churn<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.209> tendon<00:03:13.599> like<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.840> spring<00:03:14.290> let

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
to churn up a tendon like a spring let

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.619 
to churn up a tendon like a spring let
it<00:03:14.950> go<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> muscle<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:15.790> keeps<00:03:16.090> tuning

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
it go and the muscle just keeps tuning

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.539 
it go and the muscle just keeps tuning
the<00:03:17.139> tendons<00:03:17.590> but<00:03:17.799> I'll<00:03:17.919> remove<00:03:18.130> them<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> take

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
the tendons but I'll remove them to take

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.089 
the tendons but I'll remove them to take
place<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:18.970> kinetic<00:03:19.450> energy<00:03:19.810> basically<00:03:20.739> you're

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
place so kinetic energy basically you're

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.759 
place so kinetic energy basically you're
not<00:03:21.130> wasting<00:03:21.700> energy<00:03:22.090> when<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.660> move<00:03:22.900> muscle

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
not wasting energy when you move muscle

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.379 
not wasting energy when you move muscle
takes<00:03:23.919> up<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.250> large<00:03:24.459> percent<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.060> our<00:03:25.180> body

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
takes up a large percent of our body

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.710 
takes up a large percent of our body
mass<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.650> greedy<00:03:27.090> requires<00:03:28.090> oxygen<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
mass so it's greedy requires oxygen and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.089 
mass so it's greedy requires oxygen and
nutrients<00:03:29.139> and<00:03:29.319> it's<00:03:29.470> definitely<00:03:29.799> going<00:03:30.010> to

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
nutrients and it's definitely going to

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.409 
nutrients and it's definitely going to
need<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> have<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.730> sort<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.000> stuff<00:03:31.269> to

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
need to have that sort of stuff to

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.420 
need to have that sort of stuff to
maintain<00:03:31.840> its<00:03:32.049> ability<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.500> move<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.069> support

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
maintain its ability to move and support
