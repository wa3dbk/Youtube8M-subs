drawback is these I do have a pair of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.980 
drawback is these I do have a pair of
these<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.959> they<00:03:23.080> come<00:03:23.260> with<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.680> my<00:03:24.990> den

these that they come with in my den

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.600 
these that they come with in my den
Arcadia's<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:26.709> use<00:03:26.920> for<00:03:27.100> work<00:03:27.340> and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
Arcadia's that I use for work and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.910 
Arcadia's that I use for work and
they're<00:03:27.910> not<00:03:28.090> bad<00:03:28.420> but<00:03:29.380> I<00:03:29.410> think<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.740> is<00:03:29.890> just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
they're not bad but I think this is just

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.320 
they're not bad but I think this is just
the<00:03:30.160> cheap<00:03:30.430> way<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:31.060> avoiding<00:03:32.220> an<00:03:33.220> insole<00:03:34.090> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
the cheap way of avoiding an insole I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.260 
the cheap way of avoiding an insole I
don't<00:03:34.510> know<00:03:34.570> if<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.870> see<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.260> or<00:03:35.440> not

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
don't know if you can see that or not

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.400 
don't know if you can see that or not
but<00:03:37.270> they<00:03:37.360> do<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.720> they<00:03:37.959> don't<00:03:38.110> really<00:03:38.200> have

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
but they do have they don't really have

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.979 
but they do have they don't really have
a<00:03:38.440> true<00:03:38.740> insole<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.490> there<00:03:39.520> of<00:03:40.480> course<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.870> can

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
a true insole in there of course you can

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.510 
a true insole in there of course you can
get<00:03:41.080> your<00:03:41.200> doctor<00:03:41.560> Scholl's<00:03:41.830> or<00:03:42.340> your

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
get your doctor Scholl's or your

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.910 
get your doctor Scholl's or your
whatever<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.959> like<00:03:44.200> I've<00:03:44.410> never<00:03:44.620> really<00:03:44.830> been

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
whatever you like I've never really been

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.010 
whatever you like I've never really been
big<00:03:45.160> on<00:03:45.280> insoles<00:03:45.730> but<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.000> think<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.270> might<00:03:46.450> try<00:03:46.630> a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
big on insoles but I think I might try a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.250 
big on insoles but I think I might try a
pair<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.650> insoles<00:03:47.950> with<00:03:48.220> these<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.390> um<00:03:49.660> this<00:03:50.200> is

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
pair of insoles with these so um this is

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.680 
pair of insoles with these so um this is
kind<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.620> Danner's<00:03:50.980> new<00:03:51.700> big<00:03:52.060> thing<00:03:52.090> to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
kind of Danner's new big thing to

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.470 
kind of Danner's new big thing to
introduce<00:03:53.380> it's<00:03:53.620> supposed<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.239> heel<00:03:55.239> cup

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
introduce it's supposed to be a heel cup

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.990 
introduce it's supposed to be a heel cup
and<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.920> arch<00:03:56.920> support<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:57.730> think<00:03:57.880> it's

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
and a arch support I just think it's
