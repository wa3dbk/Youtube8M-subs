weather's getting a little colder so
we're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> take<00:00:35.280> advantage<00:00:35.580> of<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
we're going to take advantage of the

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.000 
we're going to take advantage of the
moon's<00:00:36.240> natural<00:00:36.720> texture<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.410> give<00:00:37.800> them<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
moon's natural texture and give them a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
moon's natural texture and give them a
really<00:00:38.370> nice<00:00:38.520> soft<00:00:38.910> loose<00:00:39.330> waves<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:40.470> best

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
really nice soft loose waves the best

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
really nice soft loose waves the best
thing<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.310> trend<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.150> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
thing about this trend right now is that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
thing about this trend right now is that
the<00:00:42.930> curl<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.650> way<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.220> end<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the curl is on all the way to the end of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.830 
the curl is on all the way to the end of
the<00:00:44.520> tip<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> hair<00:00:45.030> we're<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.480> doing<00:00:45.720> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the tip of the hair we're just doing the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
the tip of the hair we're just doing the
base<00:00:46.050> curl<00:00:46.380> and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> straighter<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
base curl and then a straighter end and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900 
base curl and then a straighter end and
it<00:00:48.330> gives<00:00:48.540> you<00:00:48.720> more<00:00:48.990> of<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.590> messy<00:00:50.340> textured

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it gives you more of a messy textured

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.230 
it gives you more of a messy textured
bedhead<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:52.530> i'm<00:00:52.650> clarissa<00:00:53.060> we've<00:00:54.060> done

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
bedhead look so i'm clarissa we've done

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.790 
bedhead look so i'm clarissa we've done
the<00:00:54.360> bottom<00:00:54.660> portion<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.140> her<00:00:55.230> hair<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.770> a

the bottom portion of her hair with a
small<00:00:56.160> barrel<00:00:56.430> curl<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.870> curling<00:00:58.200> iron

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
small barrel curl this curling iron

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.890 
small barrel curl this curling iron
doesn't<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> clip<00:00:59.310> that<00:00:59.490> allows<00:00:59.910> us<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
doesn't have a clip that allows us to

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.369 
doesn't have a clip that allows us to
grab<00:01:01.050> hair<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:02.310> ease<00:01:02.810> you<00:01:03.810> can<00:01:03.930> twist<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
grab hair with ease you can twist it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.959 
grab hair with ease you can twist it
around<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.650> few<00:01:04.680> times<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> loser<00:01:05.820> wave

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
around a few times just get a loser wave

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.779 
around a few times just get a loser wave
and<00:01:06.179> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.359> wrap<00:01:06.509> it<00:01:06.539> around<00:01:06.749> easily<00:01:07.789> flip

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
and you can wrap it around easily flip

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.219 
and you can wrap it around easily flip
it<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:08.999> a<00:01:09.090> few<00:01:09.240> seconds<00:01:11.630> let<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:13.109> gonna

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it for a few seconds let go I'm gonna

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.219 
it for a few seconds let go I'm gonna
get<00:01:13.409> soft<00:01:13.859> loose<00:01:14.100> wave<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.810> difference

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
get soft loose wave the difference

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
get soft loose wave the difference
between<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.249> regular<00:01:17.670> curling<00:01:18.030> iron

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
between that and a regular curling iron

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.419 
between that and a regular curling iron
is<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.109> sometimes<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> curling<00:01:19.979> iron<00:01:20.069> you

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
is that sometimes the curling iron you

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.190 
is that sometimes the curling iron you
can<00:01:20.579> do<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> same<00:01:21.119> thing<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:22.079> doesn't

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
can do the same thing with it or doesn't

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.959 
can do the same thing with it or doesn't
have<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> keep<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.710> clip<00:01:22.890> open<00:01:23.219> you<00:01:23.609> also<00:01:23.729> get

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
have to keep your clip open you also get

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.910 
have to keep your clip open you also get
a<00:01:24.030> flatter<00:01:24.420> curl<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.049> curling<00:01:25.350> iron<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
a flatter curl with curling iron with a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.919 
a flatter curl with curling iron with a
clip<00:01:26.219> so<00:01:26.609> using<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.030> without<00:01:27.299> gives<00:01:27.719> you<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
clip so using one without gives you a

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.719 
clip so using one without gives you a
fuller<00:01:28.229> loser<00:01:28.770> wave<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.130> opposed<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
fuller loser wave as opposed to a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
fuller loser wave as opposed to a
flatter<00:01:30.179> more<00:01:31.109> voluminous<00:01:31.380> wave<00:01:31.859> so<00:01:32.789> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
flatter more voluminous wave so this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.520 
flatter more voluminous wave so this
look<00:01:33.179> looks<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.899> great<00:01:34.109> on<00:01:34.170> someone<00:01:34.499> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
look looks really great on someone that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.499 
look looks really great on someone that
already<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> natural<00:01:35.819> wave<00:01:35.969> in<00:01:36.119> their<00:01:36.270> hair

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
already has a natural wave in their hair

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
already has a natural wave in their hair
but<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.139> a<00:01:37.170> natural<00:01:37.409> pink<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:37.950> and
