the star mobile diamond x1 so if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.680> time<00:00:25.890> you'll<00:00:26.010> be

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
mistaken this the first time you'll be

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.540 
mistaken this the first time you'll be
seeing<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.640> device<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> video<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
seeing the device on a video so I'm a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
seeing the device on a video so I'm a
exclusive<00:00:30.150> feeling<00:00:30.510> lamp<00:00:30.689> diabeetus<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.470> box

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
exclusive feeling lamp diabeetus and box

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.990 
exclusive feeling lamp diabeetus and box
so<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.050> you're<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.130> Union<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so we have it here you're the Union so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
so we have it here you're the Union so
as<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.570> quite<00:00:36.690> bigger<00:00:37.020> that's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
as you can see it's quite bigger that's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
as you can see it's quite bigger that's
a<00:00:37.320> case<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.309> looks<00:00:38.610> quite<00:00:38.850> thick<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.149> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
a case on so it looks quite thick but if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.970 
a case on so it looks quite thick but if
you<00:00:39.480> take<00:00:39.660> away<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> case<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.829> actually

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you take away the case it's actually

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.270 
you take away the case it's actually
very<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.460> thin<00:00:41.910> very<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.770> light<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
very very thin very very light now this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.840 
very very thin very very light now this
actually<00:00:44.640> seven<00:00:45.030> millimeters<00:00:46.399> thick<00:00:47.399> only<00:00:47.700> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
actually seven millimeters thick only so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080 
actually seven millimeters thick only so
it's<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.829> thin<00:00:49.829> compared<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's very very thin compared to a lot of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's very very thin compared to a lot of
other<00:00:51.239> smartphones<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.289> let's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
other smartphones out there so let's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
other smartphones out there so let's
take<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> look<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.610> there<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> six

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
take a look see there we have the six

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.369 
take a look see there we have the six
inch<00:00:55.579> display<00:00:56.579> HD<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.480> Full<00:00:57.719> HD<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
inch display HD it's not Full HD and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.700 
inch display HD it's not Full HD and
while<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.370> people<00:00:59.399> may<00:00:59.940> nitpick<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
while some people may nitpick at that it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.560 
while some people may nitpick at that it
actually<00:01:01.949> has<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> lot<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> benefits<00:01:03.270> being

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
actually has a lot of benefits being

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually has a lot of benefits being
just<00:01:04.019> HD<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> octa-core<00:01:06.420> processor

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just HD because the octa-core processor

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
just HD because the octa-core processor
doesn't<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.560> any<00:01:07.770> problem<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
doesn't have any problem with it the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
doesn't have any problem with it the
frame<00:01:08.850> rates<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.350> overall<00:01:10.830> performance

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
frame rates and the overall performance

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
frame rates and the overall performance
is<00:01:11.549> much<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:12.000> better<00:01:12.210> compared<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is much much better compared to a lot of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
is much much better compared to a lot of
other<00:01:13.229> devices<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.250> again<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.640> carries<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
other devices so again this carries the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
smartphone or in the fab that is here of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
smartphone or in the fab that is here of
course<00:01:27.750> being<00:01:27.990> 6<00:01:28.320> inches<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:29.340> everybody<00:01:29.850> will

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
course being 6 inches not everybody will

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.609 
course being 6 inches not everybody will
like<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> since<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.720> phablet<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> those

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like it since the phablet but to those

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
like it since the phablet but to those
who<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.799> looking<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.159> something<00:01:32.310> big<00:01:32.579> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
who are looking for something big it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
who are looking for something big it's
probably<00:01:33.570> good<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.009> case<00:01:35.220> is

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
probably good know so it's the case is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.440 
probably good know so it's the case is
something<00:01:35.549> i<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.150> will<00:01:36.270> come<00:01:36.360> from

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
something i think that will come from

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
something i think that will come from
star<00:01:36.720> mobiles<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.229> use<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
star mobiles you can use it like that so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
star mobiles you can use it like that so
if<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.490> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> watch<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.060> videos<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:40.229> also

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
if you want to watch for videos it also

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.219 
if you want to watch for videos it also
has<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> flap<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.790> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> supposed<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
has that flap here which is supposed to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
has that flap here which is supposed to
show<00:01:43.439> time<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> close<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
show time I think when you close it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
show time I think when you close it
now<00:01:45.090> let's<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.689> still<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> prototype

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
now let's this is still the prototype

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
now let's this is still the prototype
unit<00:01:46.590> by<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.030> there<00:01:48.030> might<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.299> some

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
unit by the way so there might be some

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
unit by the way so there might be some
changes<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> final<00:01:50.460> unit<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
changes with the final unit when it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
changes with the final unit when it
comes<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
comes out so as you can see here the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.080 
comes out so as you can see here the
back<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> metallic<00:01:54.740> plate<00:01:55.939> here

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090
