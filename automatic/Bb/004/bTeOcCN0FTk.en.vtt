00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Every modeller faces the problem of cleaning tracks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
During the time, tracks are becoming dirty due to dust, preventing exploitation of models

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I've solved this problem by making a vacuum cleaner for tracks

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.000
The main part of vacuum cleaner is the self-made compressor wheel 25mm diameter

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Another parts are: trucks from stand model KT8, because the motor has been inserted

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.000
And Buhler motor from Lima-model, which was replaced to the LH drive also

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The resistor 20 Om 15 W is also important part, as it makes the car running slowly and the cleaner working with max efficiency.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The cleaner is ready to work. The dust box is empty and filter is clean

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:05.000
To begin with, we use eraser for prepurification

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I also use foam rubber to show you how the cleaner works

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The track cleaning car passes minmal radiuses from 190 mm easily
