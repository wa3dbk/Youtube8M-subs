 an ancient Italic divinity originally mythical king who governs Italy 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.730
 later identified by the Romans with the chrono god of the Greeks although the two 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.660
 figures originally did not have many similarities 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.330
 more than anything else there are similarities between Saturn and the Greek goddess demeter - why 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.870
 they are linked to damage to agriculture 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.290

 in saturnia forward immunity from tradition the foundation of birth on 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.390
 Campidoglio, the inhabited cemetery known by the Roman tradition 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 that in honor of the god would have taken the name of saturnia 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.360
 this altar has a very ancient aspect and in fact we know from the sources evening 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.710
 previous to the temple of Saturn that we will see immediately from you 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.890
 and that it was positioned at the same time 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.800
 here of this wool and to adapt not later than the third century BC 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.310

 we are at the foot of the Campidoglio baci under the tabularium 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.210

 the temple of saturn was built to celebrate the reggio period 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:12.069
