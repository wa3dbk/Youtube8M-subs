00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.510
 we engage diner 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.369
 nothing I want to send a greeting to all 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.070
 my colleagues who collaborate in the 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.480
 Several pages are comrades and they resolve 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.779
 many of the doubts that you 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.250
 present and well let's start the day 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.919
 today I'm going to talk about certification 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.470
 of double certification grants the 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.839
 US Department of Transportation 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.029
 North America not to do so extensive 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.920
 everything that this certification entails 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.839
 I 'll give you a little summary of what 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.699
 that I had to read the department of 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.320
 gringo transport demands that all 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.690
 helmets are seen to be traded in their 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.840
 country comply with the federal standard of 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.020
 motorized vehicles their acronyms are 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.970
 efe mv ss 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.410
 as I said before, it's a fucking 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.860
 piece of me is a shitload of the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.290
 parameters from the size of the head 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.160
 to the circumference what is going to 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.690
 protect it what serves good once from 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.570
 that all the measures are already taken 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 for each define for each size of 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.340
 head make a test with a dummy 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.420
 with what would come being a human is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.490
 fictitious and with the helmet on they grab and 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.020
 they crash into a yonke and they take 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.479
 the time it takes in ballast in 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 slow down the movement of the head 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.830
 of the monkey 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.800
 this helmet is only going to be certified if 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.930
 the helmet passes the tests of 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.750
 deceleration that they stipulate that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.540
 da is certified and orders the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 manufacturer that place labels on 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.820
 the hull or within him this 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.650
 certification on these labels must 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.490
 be printed the name of the manufacturer 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.850
 the size or size model and the year of 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.460
 manufacture as well as the information of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.670
 the one of the materials with which it was 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.410
 manufactured at least good already by 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.170
 last to recognize a helmet 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.120
 certificate number 1 we are going to look for a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.810
 label on the helmet at the height of the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.810
 back of the meter 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.960
 well here I put them as an example I'm 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.930
 I'm going to clear certificate is this is not 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.140
 an integral helmet is a medium helmet but 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.860
 comes with certification as I said 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.160
 in the parameters they have they have 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.560
 with the measures the circumference of the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.330
 head in this case is a medium size 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.330
 that would be unitary 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.519
 within the things that it runs must 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.319
 stop sleep at least you no longer 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.110
 I'm talking about full-face helmets like 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.260
 a minimum must cover the forehead 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.849
 part and it is clear that this helmet 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.650
 It will not save me from having to swallow 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.970
 liquefied for six months but good 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.340
 is certified go 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.820
 here is the first label of which 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.620
 I speak to you the sample of two errors and 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.290
 suffocate goods 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.799
 now number two the label of which 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.799
 talk to them 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.090
 where the company comes the warnings 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.770
 the materials with which it was manufactured 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.690
 good in English but espolÃ­ stiller 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.300
 now we already wanted you to have your 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.270
 respective their respective logo of the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.280
 department of transport and its label 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.230
 let's make sure he has a 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.000
 inch of Chilean July that would come 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 being here 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
 It is a coating of the interior by the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.720
 minimal one inch style as we 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.190
 we can realize we put the thumb and 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.160
 the phalanx is the one that will indicate us 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.380
 that is an inch the outside says the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.540
 label that I'm seeing them or fiber of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.579
 glass 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.519
 this is the outside would be the 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.219
 hard shell and the filling of the 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.569
 polyethylene with its respective lining and 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 as I had already told you all 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.620
 we know that an integral helmet is much 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.950
 better than a half helmet but also 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.319
 there are integral helmets that do not have a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.379
 inch of polyethylene and that could be 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.060
 of doubtful quality that is, it may be that 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.220
 a lot that also have you hoarse take 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.709
 It is best to buy a helmet either 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.039
 the 2000 certification or the one that they have 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.570
 the two do not know right now as as it is called 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.780
 the certification that is done in a 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.340
 europe but with a certification already 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.870
 you have the certainty that you are not going to 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.680
 break the helmet helmet when giving 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.449
 a fuck 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.330
 at least it will protect you a little more 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.729
 head now certification 2 is not 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.979
 the best of the certifications but already 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.349
 it's a bit decent certification in 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.910
 against helmets that are nothing more than 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.280
 fiberglass and nothing else has a 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.750
 mattress these helmets do not even go 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.310
 to do the work stoppage they will not serve you 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.870
 as if he walked with his head 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.000
 discovered good 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.530
 please do not forget to give her little hand 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 above if this information served you 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.900
 I invite you to go through my channel 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.550
 basic mechanics 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.210
 and finally we'll see you next 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.210
 videos
