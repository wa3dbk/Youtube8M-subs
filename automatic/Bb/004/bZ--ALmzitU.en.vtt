 so much must people welcome 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.110
 to a modern warfare 2 comments 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.790
 a free fall on the map trailerpark 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.259
 yes, of course, I'm calling you now 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.279
 welcome again 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.890
 after a longer video break 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 and two I play today with the acr 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.560
 silenced with scavenger with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 stopping power and ninja I 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.900
 made for me today is free for everyone 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 yes, such a paraded discipline of love 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.149
 at least asylum in mw2 and me 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 I just thought so dear 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.790
 friends rocking times the bude 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 how can I do that in a modern way ? 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.070
 Warfare 2 floors to go yes you have to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.539
 Of course not the over pro gamer 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 to go flawless 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.360
 You just have to be lucky 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 have good lobby and mw2 it is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.980
 of course important to a headset on 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 to have 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.250
 otherwise of course plays the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.799
 map a certain role and not think 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.439
 Of course, Trailerpark is a great deal 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.570
 Located because this card is extreme 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.580
 small and as you can see here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.280
 I also do the areas extremely well for 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.820
 me the finds and of course 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.650
 extremely well cover the areas 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 guard and that too what I am here 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.640
 make it look very nice 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.350
 Of course I would have graduated 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.020
 my classic setup so on the 5 the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 predator on the 7 harrier and on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.220
 the new tableaux the parade 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.860
 of course, of course, now quite nice 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.320
 sure on the outlined colleagues here 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.280
 and then check that it continues 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 I've tried here so 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.890
 a bit more to create an overview 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.810
 because I wanted to stop at that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 go gameplay afloat and if you can 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.290
 a kill for the guardian is then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.420
 Of course I want my mens too 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.799
 they just have a nice time here 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.590
 placed in the middle where a red dot 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.720
 appears then the thing is actually 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 also relatively good you can see me here 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.930
 get hip marca a catch harry 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.280
 and yes this one was nice to me now 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.409
 That's what I've got 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.780
 brought the colleague and the one behind 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.340
 Here you can see nice xbox m again 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.500
 but my heart brings me too 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.080
 automatically to paypal 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.110
 that's actually where I say it 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.660
 mw2 because I have my harry brings 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 me to the peglow 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.060
 had predator in the beginning that were halt 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 just time 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.080
 and you saw her, I move 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.480
 pretty much in the area here 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
 Trailers so you one you have to stop 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
 I just want to think in terms of freefall 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.520
 Also a map where the sports 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.100
 are relatively fixed 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.560
 that means you have fixes at trailerpark 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.390
 bonns I would like to go there so offensively 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.760
 and catch me a second or 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.580
 I just want the defensive 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.620
 choose away and just the times 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.690
 run that I say that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
 I just pick up my colleagues 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.420
 I have a safe spot here now 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.980
 for example the claymore again 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.320
 placed because I just thought more 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 who has come again and now 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.920
 he ran in and I have here 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.680
 really lucky because he has 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.760
 the pill and pill is not like that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.530
 tingling now I have the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.970
 clamp placed higher go but behind 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.410
 me and grab me right now 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.410
 and then I thought I'd solve it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.880
 just because the pablo needs his 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.620
 defensive seen the colleague is again 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360
 Engraved this time from the other side 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.730
 That's why I'm out of the house 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 because you should not go to a spot 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.519
 Kempen twice and get someone away 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.410
 it 's actually where you look 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.510
 punish yourself if you do that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.519
 power and of course the paypal is up 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.100
 his map like trailerpark extremely 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.830
 What you can see here, too 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.200
 there can be a fifties after that 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.150
 other purely it's crass as if 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 you go to ATMs and withdraw money there 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.799
 Bling does not bling 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.570
 It would be nice if that was true but no 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.180
 as long as the paypal is up one has one 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.829
 just shut off the hearing and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.200
 You can then also relatively safe 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.810
 open again because of the pablo 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.730
 really does a lot of work but you 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.200
 see that the cover here too 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.090
 For example always a cover after 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.010
 take the other and try 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.110
 Keep up here too, always nice 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.269
 Cover the cover and the match 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.610
 then it's already past the end of 30 too 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.470
 null so as expected I have it 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.720
 announced today a fast match 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.910
 of course, paypal has a lot on me 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.169
 kills work we can do 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.780
 write under it have you ever 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.370
 lazy managed if so 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.530
 did you manage with two blacks ? 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.960
 where was your flores or what was yours? 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.310
 best free for everyone that you play 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 Just write me something 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.620
 Until next time 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 Hello
