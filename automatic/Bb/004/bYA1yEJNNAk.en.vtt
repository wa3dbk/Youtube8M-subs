00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.019
 a bouquet of flowers with square hearts 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.320
 pic 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.900
 I run through the papers and I will ask you in rumi 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.539
 stop and anywhere I could 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.449
 take one of these miss top cards 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.260
 when you want schopfer well read one 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.090
 card any card looks at 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.279
 remember the and you live it in a point 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 any terminated when you want to tell me 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.480
 stop stop with the deck we do it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 see also a favor of room like that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.120
 missing somewhere in March 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.829
 despite the mixture I believe that the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 cat that you chose may in some 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.219
 humanitarian way and I believe it can be 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.760
 a red card of hearts 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.660
 the ace of hearts with it very well this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.699
 is the marker 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 I ask you to make this house unique 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.229
 make a signature in something that makes it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.610
 this card is the only one in the world to be 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.299
 signed in this way perfect 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.390
 we see the red ace of hearts the only one 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.100
 soccer to be signed so now me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.810
 I also do a couple of points from time to time 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.240
 to realize that really the only one 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.700
 in the world than in this type of film 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 if I take a lasso I allow more or 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.900
 less in the middle of the deck I said more 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 or less than 100 actually this is the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.590
 twenty-eighth card starting from the top 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.479
 of the deck 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.150
 but a certain thing that the card cannot 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.400
 to be 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 it can't even be the last card 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 of the deck it is enough to rub the first one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.230
 card that the ace of hearts jumps to the top 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.180
 to the deck 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.250
 look i also want to add three 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.990
 sandwiches so much to realize that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 stands for the only stage to be signed 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.900
 in this way that is found in this 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.320
 moment on the table 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.930
 the paper is really enough for a moment 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.570
 jumps out of the red step deck of 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.630
 hearts disappear from the neck of March 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.770
 it is the only one to be signed in this 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.270
 so some I also do 44 limit 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.280
 just to realize that really 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.860
 the only one to be signed what if me 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.230
 I take the ace the signed and lament card 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.780
 so very slowly I put it more or 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.360
 less in the center of the deck the center of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.820
 march my moment really at the center 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.350
 of March in this case we really are 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.400
 rest assured that the card cannot be the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:34.620
 first card of the deck can though 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 to become a red heart good to us 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.230
 we must certainly follow the paper 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.150
 the ace but we must also follow the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.570
 back of the card as we do well if 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.250
 I do this we call a camber 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.290
 there is a kind of turn is fine 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.420
 we can't follow the map 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.470
 also from behind and the fold that it really is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.769
 important because at this point you can 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.930
 be accountable when it happens 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.060
 because the fold that knows other on top of the 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.190
 March when I move a lot 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.830
 very slowly because a vr card is 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.500
 folded up to chance is just the ace 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.730
 red liqueur the paper that had been 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.450
 signed life now we do also leave 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.920
 even so 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.319
 the fold that is a little bigger 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.410
 I said something so important in 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.900
 this game being me a card with the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.250
 fold we went so to remove the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.640
 full what happens and that goes away 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.800
 the signature this happens because if 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.720
 let's go and see in my pocket 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.970
 I from the beginning here in mine 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.319
 wallet and we made one 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.170
 I predict from the beginning we go to 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.760
 see they had made a tradition 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.120
 here here so I remember in the pocket 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.200
 the one closed by the button because I in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.360
 some way 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.230
 I knew you would choose this 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.849
 I play a card a new red card 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.890
 always very slowly 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.200
 I knew the card would be later 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.620
 slightly bent in this way not 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.510
 only 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.920
 I knew he had chosen the ace of hearts 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:14.049
 and that remains so explained 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:18.209
 this way ace red liquor game 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.209
 of the card in the wallet
