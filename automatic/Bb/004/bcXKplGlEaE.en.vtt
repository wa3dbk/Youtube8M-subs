00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
little earlier in this video that I'm

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830 
little earlier in this video that I'm
drawing<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.770> drawing<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.790> her<00:02:26.910> face<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.510> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
drawing this drawing of her face from it

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.950 
drawing this drawing of her face from it
is<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.250> beautiful<00:02:29.520> but<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.810> very

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
is so beautiful but it is very very

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.260 
is so beautiful but it is very very
difficult<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.740> me<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.130> draw<00:02:32.460> people<00:02:32.760> when

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
difficult for me to draw people when

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.540 
difficult for me to draw people when
their<00:02:33.390> faces<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:33.960> tilted<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.280> little

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
their faces are tilted up and a little

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.280 
their faces are tilted up and a little
bit<00:02:35.640> turn<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.090> way<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
bit turn this way and just the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.790 
bit turn this way and just the
proportions<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.190> eschewed<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.800> sometimes

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
proportions are eschewed so I sometimes

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.850 
proportions are eschewed so I sometimes
struggle<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:43.080> something<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
struggle if it's not like something that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.500 
struggle if it's not like something that
I'm<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> hundred<00:02:44.310> percent<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.880> okay<00:02:45.240> I<00:02:45.270> want

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
I'm a hundred percent like okay I want

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
I'm a hundred percent like okay I want
to<00:02:45.570> draw<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.930> person<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> portrait<00:02:47.070> in

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
to draw this person in this portrait in

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.370 
to draw this person in this portrait in
this<00:02:47.340> angle<00:02:47.760> sometimes<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.630> take<00:02:48.840> pictures<00:02:49.080> of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
this angle sometimes I take pictures of

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560 
this angle sometimes I take pictures of
actual<00:02:49.950> people<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.550> life<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.090> draw<00:02:51.330> them

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
actual people in my life and draw them

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.449 
actual people in my life and draw them
sounds<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.500> creepy<00:02:52.680> stalkerish<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
sounds kind of creepy stalkerish and

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.449 
sounds kind of creepy stalkerish and
weird<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.240> just<00:02:54.660> me<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:56.100> when<00:02:56.430> I

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
weird but that's just me and so when I

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.460 
weird but that's just me and so when I
don't<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.390> certain<00:02:57.690> angle<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.110> usually

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
don't like a certain angle I usually

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.360 
don't like a certain angle I usually
won't<00:02:58.650> pet<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.580> draw<00:03:00.209> I'll<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.570> pass<00:03:01.370> this
