00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.810
 hello welcome to my channel in this 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.760
 occasion we're going to make milk pudding 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.210
 then our ingredients that we're going 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 to occupy is condensed milk sugar 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:36.060
 vanilla evaporated milk 3 eggs 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.540
 and a pan 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.190
 with 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.310
 then let's start doing 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.540
 our candy let's start with 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.920
 put our sugar in there is that 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.809
 this is a quarter of sugar but 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.839
 because we do not want that we're going to get 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.570
 very sweet then if you like it 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.839
 Sweetest can get their sugar 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.719
 that they like or this half cup is going to be 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.460
 a cup then let's leave the 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.820
 sugar 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.740
 that covers the seat and we're going to go 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.409
 leaving alone and as we go looking 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.470
 it is changing a little color the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.530
 we are going to move little by little 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.050
 so that fire does not burn then 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.310
 It has to be medium neither too short nor 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.110
 very high and you just have to wait 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.050
 Now I change a little bit of color 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.040
 we tell them how to start moving 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.820
 a little more 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.789
 you have to caramelize the sugar and see if 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.500
 milan is already melting and only the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.500
 let's move like this in this way 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.310
 so little movements until I go 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.830
 grabbing the little color because if 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.810
 we want clarito then that option of 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.870
 us or if we want a little more 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.170
 dark but I say that middle term ni 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.259
 so dark nor clarito 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.630
 and then once it's done we're going to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.509
 put there in our mold then if 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.420
 it is appreciated and a little bit that it is already 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.250
 changing is making coffee and is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.000
 this what we are going to do until now 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.080
 let's look at the little color we like 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.700
 then it is the color we want 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.700
 since you have to put it in the mold 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.540
 and if you have to do this fast 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 because then the frame starts 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.840
 It starts to cool and it's harder not to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.150
 you have to try to spread it by 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160
 all the mold all the bottom bottom 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.500
 because it 's where we want it to be 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 our candy for our flank 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.020
 we already put our candy and you have to 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.569
 let it cool down and when we cool down and let's 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.489
 put here 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.489
 Our evaporated milk 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.420
 I will leave the ingredients in the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.299
 description box the more quantities 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.090
 well the ingredients and the amounts and 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.689
 let's also throw a can of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.689
 condensed milk 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.630
 we will also put three eggs 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.900
 and we're going to put the vanilla 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.980
 then you have to invest it well 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.340
 then this since with all our 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.340
 Americans look good 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.430
 mixed 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.400
 then you have to throw them to our 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.340
 mold that we already have with candy and this 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.819
 we are going to put it in a bain-marie we already have 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.999
 our water and hot and we're going to 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.230
 to put on the level not to be covered but if 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.230
 musical good 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:28.390
 so then we're going to put it in our 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.390
 oven for one hour at 3 to 350 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.510
 So now we have just pulled out 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.660
 our flan 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.040
 and we 're going to let it cool since 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.910
 it's cool, we're going to put it in 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.220
 refrigerator all night and until 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.550
 another day we are going to turn it around 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.550
 we take out 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.480
 but that we left all night 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:58.020
 and now tomorrow we take them out and 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.900
 Now we're going to see it with a little knife 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.320
 something that have plane are all over the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.639
 gold to be stuck 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.650
 from the banks 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.900
 and now we are going to turn it 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.960
 we put the plate on it and we give it 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.570
 a turn though 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:22.030
 you have to hit it a little bit and leave it a 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.030
 I'm just going to take off 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.830
 then what to lift it carefully 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.310
 and we are left in this way 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.600
 more or less 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.700
 then let's wait and if it's a little bit 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.500
 delayed in the sense that you have 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.870
 to leave overnight in a 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.960
 fridge 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.310
 but of flavor it comes out very rich I hope them 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:57.590

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.750
