00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.309
 hello welcome to my 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.309
 channel with you ilyin today we will learn 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 knit semi patent gum with loops 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.449
 knit 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 from the underlying row for this we 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:28.260
 we collect loops on a needle number multiple 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.710
 two + 1 loop for symmetry and two 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.290
 edge loops I gained 33 loops 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.680
 we start to knit the first row is with us 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.780
 my face will be 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:48.860
 the first edge loop we take off and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 knit 1 purl loop 1 face and 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:58.670
 repeat to the end of row 1 purl 1 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 front loop 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.650
 we knit a loop for symmetry 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.869
 back and last edge we have 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:38.570
 purl loop so we're done 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.070
 knit first row 2 row this one with you 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.540
 wrong side 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.690
 we remove the first edge and knit 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:56.210
 front loop front loop 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:02:01.750
 from the loop of the underlying row and the purl 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 and repeat our report until the end of the series 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.800
 face loop 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 from the underlying row and the purl 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.380
 loop for symmetry is also a facial loop 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.540
 from the lower row and last 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.070
 bead we Wrong loop, we 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.140
 finished with your knit second row 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.720
 next we knit our semi patent 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.850
 gum with loops knit them out 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:12.750
 the underlying row repeating from 1 to 2 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.030
 knit to the desired height, repeating 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.130
 the first and second row continue to knit we 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.490
 finished with you take our floor 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:28.340
 patent gum quite dense 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.850
 gum we got the front side 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.370
 purse everyone thank you for your attention if 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.270
 Have questions write in comments with you 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.990
 was elena 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.990
 bye Bye
