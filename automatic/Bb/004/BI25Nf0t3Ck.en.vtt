getting<00:05:20.189> owned<00:05:20.370> now<00:05:21.180> i<00:05:21.210> was<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.449> little<00:05:21.659> bit

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:21.839 
getting owned now i was a little bit

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.320 
getting owned now i was a little bit
slow<00:05:22.199> there<00:05:22.789> arguably<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:23.909> should<00:05:24.150> have<00:05:24.240> put

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
slow there arguably I should have put

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.879 
slow there arguably I should have put

00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:27.689 
because that's a very quick access point

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.899 
because that's a very quick access point
and<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:27.990> one<00:05:28.139> down<00:05:28.379> at<00:05:28.409> the<00:05:28.650> bottom<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:29.849> a
