00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
from proliferating and sea

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.100 
from proliferating and sea
it<00:00:37.890> soothes<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> calms<00:00:39.149> our<00:00:39.420> stomach<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.079> well

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it soothes and calms our stomach as well

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.250 
it soothes and calms our stomach as well
and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.000> great<00:00:42.300> food<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.090 
and so it's a really great food for the
whole<00:00:43.440> digestive<00:00:43.739> tract<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.620> there<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.770> lots

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
whole digestive tract and there are lots

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.459 
whole digestive tract and there are lots
of<00:00:47.280> different<00:00:47.700> Musil<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> genus<00:00:48.629> foods<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of different Musil a genus foods this is

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
of different Musil a genus foods this is
probably<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> better<00:00:50.340> known<00:00:50.700> ones

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
probably one of the better known ones

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.080 
probably one of the better known ones
but<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> couple<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> herbs<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.460> slippery

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
but a couple of the herbs are slippery

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.350 
but a couple of the herbs are slippery
elm<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.840> also<00:00:55.440> marshmallow<00:00:56.160> root<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
elm and also marshmallow root so you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
elm and also marshmallow root so you
could<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> tea<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> used<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
could make a tea out of that I used to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
could make a tea out of that I used to
do<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.730> time<00:01:00.030> years<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.899> years<00:01:01.079> ago

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
do that all the time years and years ago

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
do that all the time years and years ago
when<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.590> had<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.859> lot<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.520> bad<00:01:02.850> digestive

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
that typically has a lot of little rocks
in<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> never<00:01:22.710> really

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
in it and that's why I never really

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.090 
in it and that's why I never really
liked<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.830> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
liked it very much but you can make a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
liked it very much but you can make a
soup<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:28.110> strain<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
soup out of that and then strain it and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
soup out of that and then strain it and
then<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> add<00:01:30.119> vegetables<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.200> cook<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
then you can add vegetables and cook it

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.630 
then you can add vegetables and cook it
after<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
after that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.370 
after that
but<00:01:33.500> what<00:01:34.500> I've<00:01:34.619> added<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:36.380> orange
