00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
other barricade still seem starts to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
other barricade still seem starts to
like<00:01:14.909> motorized<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.040> tend<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.189> revolving

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
like motorized and tend out revolving

barrel<00:01:17.939> stuff<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.200> yeah<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.530> probably

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
barrel stuff on it so yeah it's probably

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
barrel stuff on it so yeah it's probably
not<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> much<00:01:20.280> different<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
not gonna be much different here is the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.310 
not gonna be much different here is the
nerve<00:01:22.549> sonic<00:01:23.630> barrel<00:01:24.630> brick<00:01:26.600> which<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
nerve sonic barrel brick which is just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.260 
nerve sonic barrel brick which is just
like<00:01:28.470> any<00:01:28.500> barrel<00:01:29.130> brick<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> doesn't<00:01:29.939> come<00:01:30.119> of

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
like any barrel brick it doesn't come of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.609 
like any barrel brick it doesn't come of
the<00:01:30.390> special<00:01:30.869> darks<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.200> yeah<00:01:34.439> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the special darks and but yeah it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
the special darks and but yeah it's
still<00:01:34.799> pretty<00:01:34.950> cool<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.549> yeah<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.549> think<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.880> lot

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
still pretty cool and yeah I think a lot

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.550 
still pretty cool and yeah I think a lot
of<00:01:39.090> people<00:01:39.180> would<00:01:39.509> fall<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:39.720> interested<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
of people would fall over interested to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.620 
of people would fall over interested to
see<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> internals<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.970> gun<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> that's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
see the internals of this gun and that's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
see the internals of this gun and that's
why<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:43.590> made<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.189> Sonic<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:46.549> here<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
why they made it Sonic and here is the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
why they made it Sonic and here is the
sonic<00:01:48.450> long<00:01:48.990> strike<00:01:51.229> which<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.159> any

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
sonic long strike which is just like any

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.999 
sonic long strike which is just like any
long<00:01:53.610> strike<00:01:53.909> once<00:01:54.090> again<00:01:54.420> comes<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.470> normal

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
long strike once again comes with normal

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.120 
long strike once again comes with normal
clip<00:01:56.250> system<00:01:56.460> darts<00:01:58.460> and<00:02:00.170> yeah<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.710> sonic

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
clip system darts and yeah that is sonic

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
clip system darts and yeah that is sonic
which<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> cool<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.090> see<00:02:03.299> inside

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
which is cool because you can see inside

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.639 
which is cool because you can see inside
it<00:02:04.040> see<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.430> cool<00:02:05.790> stuff<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.180> it

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
it see all the other cool stuff of it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.619 
it see all the other cool stuff of it
now<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> nerve<00:02:08.819> sonic<00:02:10.039> stampede

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
now here is the nerve sonic stampede

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.370 
now here is the nerve sonic stampede
prayer<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:12.900> comes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
prayer that comes

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.800 
prayer that comes
of<00:02:13.520> green<00:02:14.520> dots<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:17.210> like<00:02:19.970> we<00:02:20.970> buy<00:02:21.270> pot<00:02:21.540> hens

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
of green dots and I like we buy pot hens

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.350 
of green dots and I like we buy pot hens
orange<00:02:22.350> which<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:23.040> would<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.670> bit<00:02:24.090> more

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
orange which I think would go a bit more

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.760 
orange which I think would go a bit more
well<00:02:24.690> than<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> gray<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:28.410> shield

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
well than the gray one and I the shield

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.130 
well than the gray one and I the shield
and<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.790> we<00:02:29.910> probably<00:02:30.150> can't<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.750> there's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and I we probably can't see it there's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.440 
and I we probably can't see it there's
actually<00:02:32.480> proper<00:02:33.480> green<00:02:34.230> not<00:02:35.450> see-through

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
actually proper green not see-through

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.280 
actually proper green not see-through
green<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.370> pretty<00:02:38.700> good<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.210> think<00:02:40.140> that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
green so that's pretty good I think that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.490 
green so that's pretty good I think that
I'd<00:02:40.410> work<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.910> vortex<00:02:42.630> guns<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:44.090> our

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
I'd work well on the vortex guns and our

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.490 
I'd work well on the vortex guns and our
next<00:02:46.500> gun<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.670> new<00:02:48.150> knife<00:02:49.340> reven<00:02:51.260> yeah<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
next gun the new knife reven yeah this

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.490 
next gun the new knife reven yeah this
far<00:02:52.770> as<00:02:52.920> glow<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.430> dark<00:02:53.820> darks<00:02:54.500> much

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
far as glow in the dark darks much

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.980 
far as glow in the dark darks much
similar<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.100> Firefly<00:02:56.730> fives<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.870> might

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
similar to the Firefly fives I might

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.560 
similar to the Firefly fives I might
have<00:02:58.080> an<00:02:58.170> 18<00:02:58.620> dark<00:02:58.890> blue<00:02:59.340> clip<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:02.570> think

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
have an 18 dark blue clip and I think

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.840 
have an 18 dark blue clip and I think
it's<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:04.020> me<00:03:04.080> off<00:03:04.350> tool<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.370> reason<00:03:05.700> for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it's a me off tool and the reason for

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.250 
it's a me off tool and the reason for
this<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.750> takes<00:03:07.100> w<00:03:08.100> berries<00:03:08.460> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
this is I know it takes w berries and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.890 
this is I know it takes w berries and
look<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.560> trigger<00:03:11.660> look<00:03:12.660> there's

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
look at this trigger look there's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.880 
look at this trigger look there's
another<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.380> won<00:03:14.240> down<00:03:15.240> boy<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> don't<00:03:16.710> think

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
another we won down boy so I don't think

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.260 
another we won down boy so I don't think
it's<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.430> stampede<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.090> think

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
it's going to be like a stampede I think

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.030 
it's going to be like a stampede I think
it's<00:03:18.390> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.570> be<00:03:18.660> more<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.900> barricade<00:03:19.500> or

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
it's going to be more a barricade or

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.100 
it's going to be more a barricade or
they<00:03:20.400> might<00:03:20.520> make<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.910> look<00:03:21.300> natural<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.870> i

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
they might make it look natural but i

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.480 
they might make it look natural but i
don't<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.740> i<00:03:22.890> think<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
don't think so i think this is going to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.050 
don't think so i think this is going to
be<00:03:23.580> like<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> barricade<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:25.550> it'll<00:03:26.550> be<00:03:26.790> Sammy

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
be like the barricade and it'll be Sammy

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.000 
be like the barricade and it'll be Sammy
oh<00:03:27.180> oh<00:03:27.240> I<00:03:27.420> think<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:28.110> don't<00:03:28.620> think<00:03:28.770> they<00:03:28.860> can

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
oh oh I think I don't think they can

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.560 
oh oh I think I don't think they can
make<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.250> feel<00:03:29.460> or<00:03:29.640> think<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.120> need<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.360> longer

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
make it feel or think you need a longer

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.140 
make it feel or think you need a longer
batteries<00:03:31.110> for<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.630> yeah<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.930> i<00:03:34.620> think

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
batteries for that and yeah and i think

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.830 
batteries for that and yeah and i think
the<00:03:36.150> power<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.900> mixed<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> darks<00:03:37.950> glue<00:03:38.280> is

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
the power that mixed the darks glue is

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.470 
the power that mixed the darks glue is
in<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.380> clip<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:44.730> because<00:03:44.880> it's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
in the clip and and that is because it's

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.760 
in the clip and and that is because it's
like<00:03:45.690> got<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.680> big<00:03:47.010> bit<00:03:47.280> sticking<00:03:47.790> out<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.270> it

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
like got a big bit sticking out of it

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.520 
like got a big bit sticking out of it
which<00:03:50.150> would<00:03:51.150> probably<00:03:51.420> suggest<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.380> you

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
which would probably suggest that you

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.980 
which would probably suggest that you
could<00:03:52.709> like<00:03:52.890> make<00:03:53.100> any<00:03:53.400> guns<00:03:53.940> darts<00:03:54.630> glue

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
could like make any guns darts glue

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.470 
could like make any guns darts glue
because<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.620> clip<00:03:55.950> that's<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.090> epic

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
because of this clip that's like epic

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.630 
because of this clip that's like epic
clip<00:03:57.780> see<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> battery<00:03:58.950> hatches<00:03:59.310> actual

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
clip see the battery hatches actual

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.540 
clip see the battery hatches actual
quote<00:03:59.820> me<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:02.150> since<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.660> AI<00:04:04.290> think<00:04:05.990> they're

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
quote me and since the AI think they're

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.670 
quote me and since the AI think they're
that<00:04:08.550> bit<00:04:08.730> there<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> great<00:04:10.080> place<00:04:10.380> for

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
that bit there be a great place for

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.710 
that bit there be a great place for
flywheels<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:12.180> there's<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:12.570> nothing

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
flywheels because there's like nothing

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.670 
flywheels because there's like nothing
now<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:14.360> yep<00:04:15.360> pam<00:04:15.750> has<00:04:16.200> three<00:04:17.160> tactical<00:04:17.730> reels

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
now and yep pam has three tactical reels

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.640 
now and yep pam has three tactical reels
attachable<00:04:19.700> barrel<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.850> seems<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:22.470> yeah

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
attachable barrel it seems so yeah

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.150 
attachable barrel it seems so yeah
pretty<00:04:23.340> cool<00:04:23.750> actually<00:04:24.750> think<00:04:25.440> i<00:04:25.680> should<00:04:26.010> look

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
pretty cool actually think i should look

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.320 
pretty cool actually think i should look
pretty<00:04:26.250> cool<00:04:26.700> with<00:04:26.880> like

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
pretty cool with like

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.520 
pretty cool with like
long<00:04:27.419> straight<00:04:27.720> barrel<00:04:28.189> be<00:04:29.189> pretty<00:04:29.430> epic<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
long straight barrel be pretty epic the

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.219 
long straight barrel be pretty epic the
air<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:31.970> first<00:04:32.970> clip<00:04:33.240> system<00:04:33.419> darts<00:04:33.900> by<00:04:34.169> the

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
air and first clip system darts by the

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.990 
air and first clip system darts by the
way<00:04:34.439> and<00:04:36.349> yeah<00:04:37.349> I've<00:04:38.159> actually<00:04:38.370> seen<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:38.759> box

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
way and yeah I've actually seen the box

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.839 
way and yeah I've actually seen the box
for<00:04:39.180> us<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.449> don't<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.689> it<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.259> and<00:04:40.849> why

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
for us I don't have it here but and why

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.369 
for us I don't have it here but and why
black<00:04:42.120> shelf<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.509> box<00:04:42.719> by<00:04:42.870> an<00:04:42.930> awful<00:04:43.229> picture

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
black shelf the box by an awful picture

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.830 
black shelf the box by an awful picture
of<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.620> box<00:04:43.830> here<00:04:44.069> but<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.000> I<00:04:45.210> think<00:04:45.479> it's

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
of the box here but and I think it's

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.670 
of the box here but and I think it's
like<00:04:46.099> it<00:04:47.099> says<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.639> Firefly<00:04:48.599> technology<00:04:49.469> so

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
like it says like Firefly technology so

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.749 
like it says like Firefly technology so
there<00:04:49.770> might<00:04:49.860> be<00:04:49.919> more<00:04:50.129> blasters<00:04:50.580> with

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
there might be more blasters with

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.920 
there might be more blasters with
Firefly<00:04:51.479> technology<00:04:52.409> I'm<00:04:53.099> not<00:04:53.520> sure<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.509> looks

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
Firefly technology I'm not sure it looks

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.439 
Firefly technology I'm not sure it looks
epic<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.680> looks<00:04:55.889> very<00:04:55.979> compact<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:57.030> looks<00:04:57.240> like

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
epic it looks very compact it looks like

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.649 
epic it looks very compact it looks like
you<00:04:57.599> know<00:04:57.919> same<00:04:58.919> sizes<00:04:59.370> our<00:04:59.550> recon<00:05:00.000> with<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
you know same sizes our recon with the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.119 
you know same sizes our recon with the
stock<00:05:01.349> so<00:05:01.710> that's<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.580> lot<00:05:02.729> smaller<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.479> if<00:05:04.440> you

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
stock so that's a lot smaller and if you
