five layers of grout first couple were
watered<00:00:38.850> down<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.989> make<00:00:40.140> sure<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.710> all

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
fig layers and it's all been carved out

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.590 
fig layers and it's all been carved out
with<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> knife<00:00:49.820> just<00:00:50.820> basically<00:00:51.120> goes<00:00:51.329> down

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
with a knife just basically goes down

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:05.270 
with a knife just basically goes down
with<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:54.000> got<00:00:54.770> thermostats<00:00:56.270> sorry<00:01:04.280> just

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
with it it's got thermostats sorry just

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:25.960 
with it it's got thermostats sorry just
basically<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:09.240> temperature<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:10.700> this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.240 

one<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.720> things<00:01:38.930> I've<00:01:39.110> been<00:01:39.140> asked<00:01:40.070> about

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
one of the things I've been asked about

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.490 
one of the things I've been asked about
is<00:01:40.630> what's<00:01:41.630> useful<00:01:43.690> sealing<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:45.020> grout

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
is what's useful sealing the grout

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:59.640 
is what's useful sealing the grout
that's<00:01:48.500> big<00:01:48.800> dragons<00:01:49.280> claws<00:01:57.460> pretty<00:01:58.460> nasty<00:01:58.880> so

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
that's big dragons claws pretty nasty so

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.140 
that's big dragons claws pretty nasty so
what<00:02:00.650> I've<00:02:00.710> gone<00:02:00.860> for<00:02:01.130> here<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.550> an<00:02:01.820> epoxy

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
what I've gone for here is an epoxy

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.750 
what I've gone for here is an epoxy
resin<00:02:02.860> which<00:02:03.860> they<00:02:04.070> normally<00:02:04.220> use<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
resin which they normally use on the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.440 
resin which they normally use on the
side<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:04.970> boats

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.000 

so<00:02:08.450> it's<00:02:08.630> marine<00:02:09.140> safe<00:02:09.440> because<00:02:09.619> obviously

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
so it's marine safe because obviously

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
so it's marine safe because obviously
has<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.160> be<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.520> water<00:02:10.730> it's<00:02:11.660> watertight

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
has to be in the water it's watertight

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.120 
has to be in the water it's watertight
and<00:02:14.030> also<00:02:14.360> it's<00:02:14.720> perfectly<00:02:15.380> safe<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:15.680> animals

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and also it's perfectly safe for animals

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.490 
and also it's perfectly safe for animals
and<00:02:16.340> withstand<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.360> heat<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:21.140> brilliant

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
and withstand the heat it's brilliant

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.160 
and withstand the heat it's brilliant
for<00:02:21.530> sealing<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:23.450> suggestion<00:02:23.750> would<00:02:23.960> make

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
for sealing it one suggestion would make

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.580 
for sealing it one suggestion would make
though<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:25.120> when<00:02:26.120> sitting<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.690> probably<00:02:27.350> best

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
though is when sitting it probably best

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.570 
though is when sitting it probably best
to<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.920> some<00:02:28.100> sand<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:29.420> some<00:02:29.660> kind<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.770> put<00:02:31.490> it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
to get some sand of some kind and put it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.500 
to get some sand of some kind and put it
in<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.590> epoxy<00:02:33.950> resin<00:02:34.280> as<00:02:34.460> you're<00:02:34.730> turning<00:02:35.330> it

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
in the epoxy resin as you're turning it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.230 
in the epoxy resin as you're turning it
down<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.270> get<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:39.459> gritty<00:02:40.459> effect<00:02:40.880> on

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
down just so you get a gritty effect on

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.960 
down just so you get a gritty effect on
it<00:02:41.390> otherwise<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.200> end<00:02:42.380> up<00:02:42.770> with<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:43.370> very

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
it otherwise you end up with a very

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.730 
it otherwise you end up with a very
smooth<00:02:44.270> surface<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.750> see<00:02:47.930> you've<00:02:48.170> got

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
smooth surface as you can see you've got

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.260 
smooth surface as you can see you've got
some<00:02:49.489> slate<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.880> there<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.330> basking<00:02:51.020> spot<00:02:55.270> line

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270

exterior ceramic bulb which is on a post
at<00:03:17.420> night<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.640> read<00:03:19.640> Bob<00:03:19.850> there<00:03:20.090> which<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.020> red

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
at night I read Bob there which the red

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.550 
at night I read Bob there which the red
bulb<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.280> often<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.030> electric<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:23.600> switch<00:03:24.410> I

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
bulb and often the electric so switch I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.470 
bulb and often the electric so switch I
can<00:03:24.590> link<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.100> with<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.310> other<00:03:25.730> light<00:03:26.000> there

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
can link it with the other light there

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.600 
can link it with the other light there
and<00:03:26.959> then<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.680> changed<00:03:27.980> that<00:03:28.070> red<00:03:28.220> Bob<00:03:28.400> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
and then it changed that red Bob to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.880 
and then it changed that red Bob to
