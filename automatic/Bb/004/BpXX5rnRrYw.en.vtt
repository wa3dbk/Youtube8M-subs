00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:11.219
 it's time to get to know more about g4 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 top of the line that has just been 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.910
 announced here in brazil by lg 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 both single and dual versions 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.170
 yes both supported 4g lt 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.850
 we spent some time with him during 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.840
 launch event you check now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.840
 our first impressions 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 the g4 was heavily criticized 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 internationally because it is one of the few 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 top of the line still using plastic 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.360
 in its construction 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.520
 after all, even samsung has migrated from 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 metal but we did not see many problems 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.969
 here in g4 we found the robust 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.200
 sufficient to be positioned 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.910
 top line segment 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 since the choice between plastic and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.829
 Leather although the appearance remains for 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.260
 step behind the galaxy s 6 galaxy s 67 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 just like g3 it is not a device 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.699
 small as it has a screen of 5.5 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.530
 inches but fits well in the hands with 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.969
 its curved rear and the positioning 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 buttons on the back was a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.899
 balcony really good and lg 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 which at first is strange but who already 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.409
 have the g3 know that after they get used to it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.409
 the solution is quite intuitive 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.990
 The skin is the item that most 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 attention here she has a new technology 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.830
 called a dowry to start 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.610
 also appear on TVs in the coming 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.350
 months 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.350
 in fact his beautiful name for a new 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.360
 generation lcd ips g4 means that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.369
 corrects the problem until the 3rd day she 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 now brings a greater contrast almost 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.990
 absence of color chromatic aberrations 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
 more alive and saturated the depth of 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.619
 range of colors super screen level 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.540
 samsung amoled what is not enough 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.979
 a criticism since they are more faithful 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.049
 ideal for anyone who thinks that amoled screens 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.450
 too saturated colors 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 the resolution remained the same as 3 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 as well as pixel density but is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
 a totally new screen that does not leave 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.450
 nothing to be desired for those who seek the best 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.920
 in this case the protection of the glass is 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.649
 unfortunately the gorilla glass 3 and not 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.899
 cheat the s4 president of the galaxy s 6 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.250
 we honestly do not understand why 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.770
 that g 4 is one of the most 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.360
 recent market offers extra protection 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.110
 such a device would be quite 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.110
 welcome 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 lg got it right here giving 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.460
 preference for consistency rather than 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.650
 gross performance 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.420
 the snapdragon 810 from which you got the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.010
 bad reputation of overheating what you did 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 with which some manufacturers gave up 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.470
 to use your smartphones as you have 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.150
 the case of samsung to opt for the Sanhedrin 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.100
 808 lg can deliver an excellent 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.740
 experience without overheating 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.360
 and not to be missed in performance and 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.640
 Make a point unless it's clear 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.470
 but it's hard to see the g4 choke 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.770
 are two high-performance cores 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.080
 based on the cortex at 57 running 1.82 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.770
 garrett and four core economies of 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.590
 energy based on the cortex at 53 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.440
 1.44 ghz this with 3 gb ram and 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.060
 gpu adreno 418 although the data sheet 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.750
 does not seem as interesting as 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.550
 dosimetry 810 or edno 7420 we find 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.260
 an ep that can not here 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.730
 besides the lg configuration made an excellent 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.220
 work on your new interface 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.440
 We had the impression of owning the 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.850
 that is, it seems more responsive until 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.160
 even than pure android itself 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.390
 present in the automatic for example 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.190
 It also includes some features 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.410
 cool with the ability to run 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.720
 two eps at the same time possibility of 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.950
 take off the sky made a gesture to the camera one 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.230
 good amount of applications 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.120
 pre-installed quite useful 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.370
 the internal memory now of 32 gigabytes 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.980
 following the evolution of the market started 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.170
 with htc the year and 9 galaxy s 6 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.820
 but unlike samsung lg no 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 abandoned the support for micro cards 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.410
 sd supporting up to 128 gigabytes of 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.820
 excellent news for those who 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.800
 do not want to be stuck in the internal memory 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.020
 galaxy s 6 s6 edge 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.790
 another point that he has hit as 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.500
 that you just said was not enough 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.380
 was to bring the latest version of 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.420
 android 5.1 lollipop this should be 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.800
 a rule between the top of the line but lg is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.800
 the only one who is fulfilling it 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.870
 the rg3 camera no longer leaves the user 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.700
 on the hand, which did not prevent him from 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.520
 evolve further into g4 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.950
 The rear has 16 megapixel movie in 4k 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.590
 has focus laser stabilization optics 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.060
 hdr image at last everything that is best 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.880
 in a top-of-the-line smartphone 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.350
 Recent quality really surprises 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.150
 in particular because of the good 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.040
 manual options for camera software 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.570
 can be automatic are excellent but 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.010
 we believe that the post software 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.050
 image processing can be 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.880
 improved but this does not mean 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.500
 away pictures that are bad 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.330
 What struck us most is the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.860
 manual mode power where it is possible to 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.960
 control the white balance 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.370
 color temperature exposure time and 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.780
 so on 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.270
 following the trend of improving 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.280
 front camera for self celi g jumped 5 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.860
 megapixels installed a camera of nothing 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.540
 less than eight megapixels and believe me 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.460
 this front camera beats a lot of camera 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.050
 back of smartphones around 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.640
 including the resource that centralizes the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.150
 photo and fill in the rest with white 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.410
 illuminating the face of the person even though 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.030
 let's not be fans of interfaces 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.930
 lg owners made an excellent 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.910
 I work here 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.770
 besides a nice look that combines with 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.540
 the very design of the device we have 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.430
 possibility of using two eps at the same 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 time of 4 also comes with the 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.850
 possibility of automating a series 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.320
 of tasks like opening an ep of music 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.660
 when the headset is connected to the 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.370
 example the list of extras is very long 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.700
 as with the recent top of the line 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.680
 WiFi standards to the Secom the bgn 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.710
 dna router support and internet wifi 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.280
 bluetooth 4.1 it is with the 2 of have 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.560
 support ap ex fm radio with rds absent 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.140
 in the galaxy six microphone dedicated to 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.930
 Noise canceling what ps with gps and 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.690
 glnass 100b of nfc and can be 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.730
 red sbt with output support of 24 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.330
 here and you can carry wireless time 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.330
 in the pattern that 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.969
 hence a point that we do not understand 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.580
 increased battery capacity from 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:57.439
 lg 2 and considering the size of g4 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.210
 We expected a bigger battery. 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.400
 at least it did not decrease the battery 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.319
 with samsung made the top of the line keep 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.080
 basically the same autonomy as three 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.310
 with 2,940 my skin capacity 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.279
 even if it brings more components 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.419
 efficient the advantage here with you not 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:13.460
 You will need to mode 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.289
 emergency to end the day with load 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.580
 At least that's the impression we had a 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.580
 quick test we did here 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:27.020
 the lg g 4 was announced for 2,999 reais 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.849
 here in Brazil very close price to 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.039
 naturally 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.050
 We really liked the device very much. 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.789
 camera, and it's great to see the 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.349
 manufacturers digging into the segment 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.819
 top of the line each of them with a 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.689
 different proposition to the consumer 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.580
 advanced 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.229
 in a few days after passing a 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.999
 For a long time, the 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.889
 background all his functions let's 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:47.659
 publish a full review beyond those already 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.729
 Five Reasons to Buy 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.930
 and five reasons not to buy a new one 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.000
 LG smartphone 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.620
