yeah not a giant horse fan but anyway I
love<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.590> cartoon<00:01:43.890> um<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.540> kid

and<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> did<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.549> slightly

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and I kind of did it in a slightly

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
and I kind of did it in a slightly
different<00:01:47.939> style<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.780> guys<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.079> seen
