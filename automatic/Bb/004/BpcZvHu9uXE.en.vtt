00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
all that many pictures so this video is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:39.820 
all that many pictures so this video is
actually<00:02:20.879> your<00:02:21.879> best<00:02:22.120> way<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.080> doing<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:26.099> dogs

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:53.420
