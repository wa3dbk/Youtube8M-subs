00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.960
 for a new unpacking video and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.189
 presentation of the small roccat keyboard 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.189
 rise tecpro 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.599
 we go as usual quickly 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.669
 start with the information that is 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.800
 present on the packaging of this keyboard 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.329
 packaging that is as usual very 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.099
 well done at roccat 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.929
 we have some key information like the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.250
 backlight key by key the 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.100
 possibility to reprogram the keys 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.980
 the anti ghosting the cortex processor the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.390
 suites cherry mx and the 470 macro that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.790
 you will be able to store directly 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.589
 on the keyboard memory we also 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 under the bar three small spaces 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.039
 keys that will be able to be used 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.570
 with the thumb that they enjoyed 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.059
 by a lot of users and it's a 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.320
 feature that is own lawyer 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.090
 so it might interest some people 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.530
 at the back you have a detail of 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.600
 all the features of the keyboard 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.280
 but we will obviously come back to it during 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 videos we will directly watch this 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.989
 who is present inside this 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.699
 little box you obviously have 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.020
 at first the keyboard that is 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.429
 well protected by a small 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.009
 plastic cover will not worry 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.080
 during transport it's a pleasure 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.700
 once we take out the keyboard we find 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.069
 obviously the manual with the information 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.780
 on the warranty and many other beautiful 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.270
 things and unfortunately that's all we 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.770
 does not have the little forceps that helps 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.160
 remove the keys which is a little 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.440
 pity 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.910
 as you can see it's a keyboard 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.209
 as it is, that is to say that you 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.259
 have absolutely no numeric keypad 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.030
 only the arrow keys 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.140
 however for a keyboard time he 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.450
 is if he is not particularly 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.239
 compact since it is still 40 cm 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.590
 wide and 23 cm deep at 

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.509
 thickness level it's classic 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 and you obviously have two skates that 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.739
 allow to raise the keyboard then 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.020
 which makes him lose his compact side 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's his imposing wrist rest 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
 marked with the roccat logo logo 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.039
 then we actually lose the side 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.500
 compact yet we still win 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.789
 greatly in comfort of use that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.379
 what we can calmly ask 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.989
 wrists while typing text 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:05.030
 or that we play however I would have 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.650
 liked that the keyboard can be 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.929
 a little safer and maybe just 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.789
 half a centimeter but there I am not 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.959
 a little bit at the level of the 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.700
 layout of the keys is very 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.740
 classic azerty nothing special to say 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.600
 there's just the caps lock key that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.580
 replaced by an easy shift key that 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.380
 so lets assign a second 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.930
 function to all keys or 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.930
 then make access to macros 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.850
 of infinity then on the keys f1 to 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.640
 f12 you obviously have some 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.950
 multimedia shortcuts to shortcuts 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.480
 to the calculator the browser 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.739
 internet not to adjust the brightness and 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.050
 you have touch that allows you to save 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.730
 macros on the fly at the level of 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.310
 switches are my favorite suites 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.050
 cherry mx crown that allow to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.180
 do as much of the office automation as 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.160
 video game at the manufacturing level 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.050
 of the keyboard I was a little bit more 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 mixed then the materials used are 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.459
 excellent quality the keyboard is very 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.620
 rigid very resistant it has no worries 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.569
 assembly is excellent right now 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.330
 I am not particularly fond of 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.780
 finishing a little bit of granular 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.920
 keyboard that wrist rests pardon 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.019
 I might have preferred plastic 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.489
 soft touch that visually romieu and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.590
 which is more pleasant to touch too 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.090
 in addition to plastic a draw like that 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.360
 they slightly sensitive to traces of 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.430
 fingers 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.019
 so if at the level of other materials 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.850
 I am more pleasant I find you 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.890
 have a briand border that does everything 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.989
 around the keyboard and around the keys 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.450
 you then have plastic mutate 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.540
 semi matte gloss with a small pattern 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.000
 who on the other hand very very well 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.030
 pilot level we are good at roccat 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.859
 with extremely complete software where 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.150
 you have different tabs the first 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.160
 will allow to settle things quite 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.920
 basic as the function of the key 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.120
 easy shift + and forgiveness when you go 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.560
 in other tabs for example 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.880
 that of touch programming 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.769
 we will be able to do things a lot 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.269
 more interesting by doing by 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.459
 example of macros or assigning a 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.359
 new function at all keys 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.130
 from your keyboard 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.750
 then at the backlight 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.850
 was extremely well done if you 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.610
 switch to manual mode you will be able to 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.500
 adjust 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.480
 the different layers while we 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.800
 was doing the layer that will show a 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.780
 once you press my cheek this kind 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.700
 of things is really all about touching 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 by manually key master of 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.020
 effect effects wave effects part 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.730
 in the living room a lot of things and it's 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.260
 quite easy to use foolish in the end 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.900
 after a few minutes we come to 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.579
 do a little bit of what you want and 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.680
 rather efficient way plus we have 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.180
 key groups that are predefined that 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.150
 allows to work much more 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.810
 quickly and so we can wants to store 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.740
 5 profiles directly on the keyboard 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.260
 that was all for this little girl 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.360
 unpacking and presentation video 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.460
 I hope you have liked it if it is 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.050
 the case do not hesitate to put a small 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.880
 blue thumbs if you have questions 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.320
 I am at your disposal in the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.460
 comments and we find ourselves very 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.460
 soon for more content
