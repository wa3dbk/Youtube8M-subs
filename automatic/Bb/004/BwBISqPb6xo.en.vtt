00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
 very good to all welcome to me 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.990
 welcome to a new video channel 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.220
 I have a new team this is a 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.740
 cheap equipment that you will be able to 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.110
 do for about 25 thousand 20 thousand coins 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.700
 even but as always announced the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.440
 players that make up this team I want 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.119
 tell you that if at the end of the video you 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.650
 like the team you like the video itself 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.960
 I would like you to support them with a 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.250
 like and I thank you very much like that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.600
 let's move on to see the pictures that 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.670
 form this team starting as 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.990
 always for the goal where in this 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.810
 case I have the olympique goalkeeper of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.340
 Marseille I have a mandanda goalkeeper who 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.630
 at the beginning when I put it there was not 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.090
 tested so far or if there is 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.350
 tried and has been very little does not inspire me 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.629
 a lot of confidence but the truth that has 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.550
 It has been a port that has worked very 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.649
 well very safe back and with which I have 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.210
 had very few failures defense of three 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.280
 starting on the left we have to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.309
 matthieu in the center span and by the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.780
 right in colo in its up version is a 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.300
 three players quite similar with 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.160
 all three are pretty fast the three 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.260
 they have a good physique the three defend 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.480
 quite the three go very well for 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.949
 up has a big jump all three and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.930
 individual things that highlight the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.790
 first is that matthieu apart from being a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.900
 great player in defense they also have 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.850
 also a great shot 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.050
 and then so you have a great exit 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 of the ball has a ball control 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.980
 pretty good it goes very well with the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.500
 controlled ball and many occasions in 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.970
 scored goal beginning the play with a stick 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.950
 since for example in a corner in 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 against the value of which they will carry 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.790
 space for running began to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.260
 run with your hand and the truth is that it's a 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.640
 very fast very big and that's what 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.590
 you add the ball control that you have 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.690
 which is pretty good, so generate a 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.100
 against quickly we went to the center of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.140
 field where we have 2,000 centers 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.760
 defensive very good for me the others 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.740
 best of the Spanish league in the in the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.420
 last and who I mean they are enzo 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.430
 pérez in its version up and luka modric 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.010
 as I say 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.540
 are for me the best midfielders and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.369
 that centers see if you maybe some 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.830
 better but as midfielder midfielder 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.600
 defensive that are not the best and already 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.190
 I could put them because I put them 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.260
 we go to the side on the left I have 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.369
 antoine griezmann his version to another 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.320
 player who has not tried until the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.820
 time and liked very much one 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.260
 very fast player has a great shot 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660
 with the left leg a lot of agility 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.759
 a lot of control of the ball and a play that 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.960
 he liked it a lot and then for the mind 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.120
 we have a player 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.560
 the only silver favor of the team but 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.330
 that really in the field for nothing 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.020
 it seems that it's silver in fact has 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.570
 very much liked that is very canijo or al 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.090
 less well I think it says in its version 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.710
 to a version also the average 69 but 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.460
 well I could sign up to this 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.170
 version as you see 91 of 73 shot rhythm 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.420
 77 dribbling in 5's of physics is a 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620
 game very fast that I shot a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.690
 well I think with the marking 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.480
 around 15 goals you also in a 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.880
 pretty decent physical millimeter 80 and 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.680
 to be silver and for what 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.420
 I needed to give insight to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.330
 one of the forwards I liked 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.440
 a lot like as a player on the right 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.690
 I have already told you many times that in this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
 training I never just used 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.040
 a lot of the bands but really in this 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.590
 team both the silver player as 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.540
 Griezmann I have appeared quite and I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.430
 they have scored enough goals we went to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.470
 offensive center in this case we have to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.570
 hammer rodríguez a player that I 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.310
 love has rhythm has shot has 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.950
 pass has ball control has 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.130
 even something physical but certainly the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.440
 ball control 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.870
 the passes are left if he is a very player 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.010
 complete plus now it's a lot more 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.990
 cheap that when the game started 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.180
 logically and for very few coins what 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.170
 you are going to be able to sign and it is a favor that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.970
 You have not tried, I recommend it to you 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.860
 one hundred percent because it is very very good 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.150
 and we went to the forwards that in this 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.800
 case we have the two strikers of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.600
 port on the left we have 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.580
 jackson martínez and on the right abu 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.040
 bakr for this lime water is why I 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.080
 I have to put that wide player 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.170
 right because there is no rapport 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
 many players of that nationality 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.020
 and already go time wanting to try 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.210
 jackson martínez de abu bakr in the same 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.320
 team and I think this was the best 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.240
 option or the best options 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.500
 talking about them two players 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.630
 starting with jackson martínez a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.250
 player with a pretty good rhythm 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.410
 jackson martinez a very complete player 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.970
 both real life and in the game its 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.110
 better fast enough a player who 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.210
 has a great shot with both 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.250
 legs a play that has a good 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.110
 physical has dribble has also four 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.430
 of skills and in general is a game that 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.470
 usually like a lot to me usually like 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.790
 a lot is also very very cheap and what 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.040
 same goes with water car is a very favor 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.120
 cheap that has 3 of pinamar and 3 of 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.590
 skills that maybe 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.329
 it's a single point so I do not just 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.859
 like prologue is fast has a 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.620
 shot and has a very good physique 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.990
 jackson martínez millimeter 85 and water 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.580
 expensive metro 84 so with any of 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.139
 both could score goals of head be 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.520
 that is with the goalkeeper today look for 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.050
 either of the two although I just 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.100
 search for jackson martínez 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.360
 so nothing guy and I hope you have 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.340

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.050
