00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.330
 well let's see how it has been 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.210
 the first 12 muffins by 1st 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.860
 the work that has been made of pastry 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.860
 in the oven this is the result 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.500
 they went in for a little while 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:45.079
 how are you looking 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.079
 and here is the first day 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:55.360
 as we say many times we put the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.360
 product prepared and prepared for 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.079
 let the oven work it and we say 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.780
 always from suns 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.980
 to see if it comes out 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.790
 it seems that the first cupcake 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.790
 they have left 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.190
 and this the important thing about an oven 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.600
 but I would throw the next tray 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.509
 and as I always say all this too 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.760
 now they are the first tests then 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.460
 put more amount what 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.600
 what I try is that that makes them 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.290
 possibly all at once 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.230
 is at 210 degrees a temperature that 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.570
 I also have to 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.690
 check in relation to the oven to be 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.450
 the biggest drum because I have to 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.719
 catch the point 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.130
 to more volume of air inside then the 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.670
 temperature has to be a little bit more 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670
 big too 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.580
 good about 45 minutes ago we have 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 Tucked a tray of chicken thighs 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.400
 and now it's time to turn it around 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.959
 As you can see, it starts to get chunky 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.959
 from the top 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.890
 we close the oven is at 220 degrees 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 but also those of the degrees is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.640
 indicative because depending on where 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.600
 put 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.380
 it has more temperature or less well what 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.980
 What I usually do is once I have 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.160
 after about 45 minutes but today the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.170
 back and now 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.170
 to what are the thighs and I'll leave it 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 ending 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.569
 until I know 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.870
 they end up making it more or less a 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.440
 hour and quarter 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.380
 more or less everything also depends on the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.280
 temperature that the oven is having 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.230
 in this oven we are still testing 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.230
 we will do 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:28.640
 checking and we will note for the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.780
 next time we put ourselves first by the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.350
 part would say ugly 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.390
 and the latter 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:42.420
 once this has happened and cooked 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.730
 in conditions is the one that will remain 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.450
 the view and the skin will be more 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.629
 crunchy and more much better 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.110
 Well, with this we put it again 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.110
 in the oven 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.010
 although I can 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.430
 you have to put on gloves because 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.430
 this is boiling 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.590
 by one hand 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.590
 as we always have problems 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.540
 as for himself 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.490
 and that is what is already done and that is what 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.490
 makes the end 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.729
 well, one hour and twenty or so 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.030
 after 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.330
 here they are already 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.810
 the chicken thighs 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:48.479
 gone with its golden color above 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.479
 and simply because we will take it out 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.790
 and we have 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.580
 a meal made more for 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.640
 sit down at the table to everyone and enjoy 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.889
 of this first roast with the oven if 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.060
 comes out 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:10.340
 very well thank you very much this is the 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.340
 first roast we have made 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.520
 and until next time
