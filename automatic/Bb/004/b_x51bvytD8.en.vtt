be<00:02:07.549> resolved<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.090> before<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.660> various<00:02:09.080> by

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
be resolved it before is in various by

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.070 
be resolved it before is in various by
there<00:02:09.530> before<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:10.399> 19<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.000> unzip<00:02:11.239> hold<00:02:11.930> up

exactly<00:02:56.780> yeah<00:02:56.900> well<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.140> think<00:02:57.230> from<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.920> one

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
exactly yeah well I think from the one

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.860 
exactly yeah well I think from the one
portion<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.879> work<00:02:59.090> mirror<00:02:59.360> but<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.569> really

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
portion of work mirror but I really

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.360 
portion of work mirror but I really
quite<00:03:00.049> interesting<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:00.920> repentant

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
quite interesting it's just a repentant

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.150 
quite interesting it's just a repentant
when<00:03:01.879> just<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:02.900> your<00:03:03.019> Shadowhunter<00:03:03.319> out<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
when just have your Shadowhunter out and

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.860 
when just have your Shadowhunter out and
it<00:03:04.250> basically<00:03:04.430> becomes<00:03:04.760> my<00:03:05.150> goal<00:03:05.390> or<00:03:05.569> sister

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
it basically becomes my goal or sister

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.210 
it basically becomes my goal or sister
who<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:06.349> kill<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> other<00:03:06.799> two<00:03:06.890> chatter

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
that we can talk it a bit less

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.629 
that we can talk it a bit less
interesting<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.079> unless<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.560> GD<00:03:12.950> their<00:03:13.190> system

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
interesting but unless a GD their system

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.890 
interesting but unless a GD their system
really<00:03:13.850> do<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.120> think<00:03:14.299> play<00:03:14.389> there<00:03:14.569> by<00:03:14.600> don't

really do you think play there by don't
like<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.380> thought<00:03:15.590> on<00:03:15.829> my<00:03:16.310> part<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
like I thought on my part of the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.640 
like I thought on my part of the
critical<00:03:17.389> point<00:03:17.569> was<00:03:17.720> 140<00:03:18.200> swallows<00:03:18.530> was

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
critical point was 140 swallows was

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.229 
critical point was 140 swallows was
Grady's<00:03:18.980> at<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.190> end<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:19.549> sealed<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> deal

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
Grady's at the end we sealed the deal

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.890 
Grady's at the end we sealed the deal
for<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:21.880> what<00:03:22.880> did<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.030> think<00:03:23.269> what<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.840> do

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
for but what did you think what what do

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.210 
for but what did you think what what do
you<00:03:23.930> think<00:03:23.989> one<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.410> before<00:03:24.769> they<00:03:24.889> lost<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
you think one that before they lost it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.509 
you think one that before they lost it
for<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.400> moment<00:03:25.609> I<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.810> remind<00:03:27.250> he's<00:03:28.250> 3rd

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
for a moment I think remind he's 3rd

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.839 
for a moment I think remind he's 3rd
borough<00:03:28.819> timings<00:03:29.420> really<00:03:29.750> late<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.430> he

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
borough timings really late and and he
