 It is a common guy with Namba barcode 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.440
 It looks like this 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 Something 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:41.079
 It looks like a little milk ice 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.079
 It has become a little yellowish arrangement 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.780

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.540

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.000
 I do n't think there are many places like that, so I think it's just right 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.380
 I guess that's pretty sweet 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.100
 I can't eat much if it's too much outside the park so I think it's just the right size 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.030
 I will 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.290

 I'm a killer and I don't know if I'm all worried 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.249
 Anyway 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.139
 It is written variously 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.569
 It is eight attire 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.349

 The preceding 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:50.930
 It was not paper of the persuasion like a dinosaur chocolate and it was firm 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.840
 Because it is a card of a little solid God 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.670
 Maybe it is difficult to stick Ha 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:03.110
 It is a ball Kira card or where is it coming off 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.930
 I'll crush a little bit, but it's pretty tough 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.060
 Even if you handle it miscellaneously 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.280
 Feeling is it will fail, such as not to time so immediately To 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.370
