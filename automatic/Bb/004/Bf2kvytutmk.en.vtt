 three version doors even and then I go 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.950
 show you how i made it 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.270
 the first is a kimono and I find it 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.290
 really super fun to be 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.090
 and the second is and ripped jeans is that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.430
 she sees you very much later 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.920
 you have a joke and knees and the very last 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.960
 is a boiler a book and I am myself 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.970
 all the way up to six my brother junkies 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 so i thought i'm gonna show you how 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.880
 who can create themselves 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 I am very sorry for this project 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.440
 is over before you do this project well 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.520
 then be sure you have a thumbs up and 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.110
 then you have to comment in the comments 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640
 leave behind or you want me more often 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.440
 do a project with another youtuber 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.970
 I really enjoyed doing that and 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.010
 then i would say let's start 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.690
 let's start with the kimono one 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.140
 litter is amazingly easy to 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.300
 to make 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.460
 I also really like to look super nice 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.960
 and a spear thrower spring and summer 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.720
 what do you need for this 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 show needed and that needle and some advice 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.740
 super little so I start with your scarf 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.620
 my mine is doubled by the way 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.300
 H &amp; M and then I have this athletic buddies but 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.380
 I want you to do this time it seems 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.070
 maybe a bit complicated but is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.229
 super easy 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 we are going to start sewing and we 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.320
 starting at the bottom it's not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.820
 to the side so that the folds 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.400
 just not about it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.880
 side and then you sew it up 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.780
 about two thirds of it is your lies 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.210
 how it cooks 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.430
 you want your arms and yes I know 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 it after you maybe not so fine then said 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.289
 I love myself for you 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.390
 I do as a hot cue but yes 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.959
 while just much better and made it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.459
 Europhile it continue for longer 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.500
 you really have to make me a kimono 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.750
 find the perfect tool and then you have to 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.130
 you there the top layer layer of the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.600
 cut the scarf 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.709
 and then you just have your kimono it is 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.510
 really super easy 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.400
 you can also fold these edges over 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 to make it even more summery 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.820
 and 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 colomer that you can with it but there 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.180
 wasting 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.140
 then we move on to the rib jeans and 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.880
 lesson series says the easiest things 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.900
 sure to make 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.270
 probably wherever you yourself 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 March 8 , coming to see us 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.440
 I'm just starting to put on the pants 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.240
 without being around the corner so one 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.970
 not exactly where the hole should go 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.810
 so I'm going to put a pencil on it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.580
 where I want a hole a comic set 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.600
 it you should also look briefly at 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.120
 a jinbei bows 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.160
 how long is it and what else it i 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.330
 maybe woman's eyes got stuck and then 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.640
 I'll just go over that with a scissors 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.190
 line 1 and I don't go all the way to the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 side but just a little bit 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.690
 yes quite wide but not quite up to it 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.860
 end so you can see a bit of your 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.440
 work goes 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.850
 so yes that is what I like best then 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.530
 I am going to name him there in my fingers 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.060
 a bit of a messy matija 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.340
 I can't get out like that and I throw it 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.470
 Coming up even just washing machine 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.970
 but this just gives the with something 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.950
 additional 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.440
 store the effect and then i put it in the 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.860
 washing machine and I did show you how 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.570
 distance so I'll just make sure montage 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.380
 I also just didn't get that nice 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.360
 close 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.580
 my father was a home so i'm just talking 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.800
 something that they district well come to you 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.800
 still bus well yes 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.750
 yes and that's how you make your rikki like 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.750
 when you are out and washing machine old surgeon 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.780
 a super nice look and you just seem the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.790
 just buy them in the store 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.790
 and now for sure 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.470
 not least the we you toy fair pants 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.239
 I also expected unpacked trip 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.600
 and I am really very happy with it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.799
 so and let's get some pegi 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.230
 pants I picked up at the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.140
 thrift store and then I grab my 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.450
 tankie and portrait book as an example 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.220
 and then I just go there a little 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.140
 goes of cover conditions goes the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.700
 be nice because i want it to not dissolve 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.620
 estimate mark that should put and then go 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.680
 I a few and the places that holes 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.650
 and then it doesn't look like one 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.480
 book has horizontal and vertical 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.210
 wires and we are going to try that vertical 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.890
 so we only have to pull out the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.330
 horizontal and that small 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.330
 teacher looks so bold 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.670
 we continue in the holes where we 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.890
 we just said we are going to u 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.940
 we want to go in there strips 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.530
 cut up 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.300
 and this should not be on I said but now 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.950
 to do because if there are none then there 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.740
 was too thick very long doing 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.540
 Then you are not going to be beautiful 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.350
 we hold out as I just explained 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.150
 which strips of a vertical 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.740
 threads out trying to pull this out 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.810
 maybe longer than you expect therefore 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.700
 I also seemed to make too many holes now 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.330
 like me i already have so many holes 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.680
 and then had to be low in fat 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.810
 Pull out and I was already quite 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.190
 you spend a long time on this process 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.080
 they cover an entire book where the holes 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.550
 I didn't want to and I also have one 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.530
 kind of a rib cut 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.640
 I just cut one through 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.170
 like me and my rib 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.970
 was in that 10 but then I'm on to him 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.250
 the side I also have a piece there 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.160
 sat under it is what was romantic 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.690
 that really a nice idea for the 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.450
 drink or to alternate a bit 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.090
 holes that would like the last series 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.560
 that video I really hope you 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.600
 liked him make sure you know one 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.270
 Thumb up and don't forget 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.860
 seen who is posting video
