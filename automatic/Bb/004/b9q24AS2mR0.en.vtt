hello my name is Maria Miller and in
this<00:00:02.939> video<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.480> want<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> show<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.140> way<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
this video I want to show you a way to

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.540 
this video I want to show you a way to
teach<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.580> zero<00:00:05.970> exponent<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.189> most<00:00:08.189> school

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
teach the zero exponent and most school

books<00:00:08.760> just<00:00:09.059> announced<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.750> playing<00:00:10.110> like

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
books just announced it playing like

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
books just announced it playing like
this<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.010> box<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.370> something<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.849> X<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
this in a box is something that X to the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
this in a box is something that X to the
zeroth<00:00:12.750> power<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.290> 1<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.940> call<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
zeroth power is 1 and I call it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
zeroth power is 1 and I call it
announced<00:00:16.440> mathematics<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.789> students

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
announced mathematics with two students

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.990 
announced mathematics with two students
has<00:00:18.330> given<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.260> rules<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> platter<00:00:20.550> without

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
has given the rules on a platter without

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630 
has given the rules on a platter without
any<00:00:21.300> justification<00:00:21.859> so<00:00:22.859> let's<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
any justification so let's not do that I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.240 
any justification so let's not do that I
have<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> better<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.810> mind<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> uh<00:00:25.769> let's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
have a better way in mind and uh let's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.660 
have a better way in mind and uh let's
just<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.760> rid<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.500> here<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> pretend

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
just get rid of this here and pretend

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.120 
just get rid of this here and pretend
that<00:00:29.820> students<00:00:30.210> actually<00:00:30.330> don't<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> yet

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
that students actually don't know it yet

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
that students actually don't know it yet
we're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> pattern<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
we're going to use a pattern and you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.569 
we're going to use a pattern and you
should<00:00:34.350> write<00:00:34.559> these<00:00:34.739> patterns<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> board

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
should write these patterns on board

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060 
should write these patterns on board
with<00:00:36.210> several<00:00:36.690> numbers<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> students

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
with several numbers for the students

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
with several numbers for the students
it's<00:00:38.760> ten<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.360> sure<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> few<00:00:40.170> others<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it's ten for sure and a few others I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's ten for sure and a few others I
just<00:00:40.890> don't<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.190> small<00:00:41.610> space<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> then

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
just don't have small space and then

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.619 
just don't have small space and then
start<00:00:43.469> working<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.950> them<00:00:44.210> from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> easiest

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
start working with them from the easiest

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
start working with them from the easiest
one<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.070> students<00:00:47.940> already<00:00:48.090> know

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
one up like this students already know

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
one up like this students already know
the<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> third<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.379> two<00:00:49.590> times<00:00:49.890> two

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the two to the third is two times two

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
the two to the third is two times two
times<00:00:50.250> two<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> they<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> fill<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
times two so they can fill this in and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.209 
times two so they can fill this in and
after<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.649> we're<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> look<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
after that we're going to look at the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.180 
after that we're going to look at the
pattern<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.719> down<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.620> happens<00:00:59.010> at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pattern from up down what happens at

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.599 
pattern from up down what happens at
each<00:00:59.309> step<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.719> 16<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.170> 8<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.129> step<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
each step from 16 to 8 in this step it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.289 
each step from 16 to 8 in this step it
gets<00:01:02.910> divided<00:01:03.210> by<00:01:03.420> 2<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.060> step

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
gets divided by 2 right and in this step

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
gets divided by 2 right and in this step
also<00:01:07.490> from<00:01:08.490> 8<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> 5<00:01:08.970> divided<00:01:09.450> by<00:01:09.570> 2<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.439> too

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
also from 8 to 5 divided by 2 here too

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.719 
also from 8 to 5 divided by 2 here too
and<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> last<00:01:13.110> step<00:01:13.560> logically<00:01:14.490> what

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and here in the last step logically what

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.230 
and here in the last step logically what
happens<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.299> divide<00:01:15.540> by<00:01:15.750> 2<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.259> more<00:01:16.290> time

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
happens is we divide by 2 one more time

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
happens is we divide by 2 one more time
and<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> answer<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.549> one<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.400> all

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and so the answer is one that was all

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
and so the answer is one that was all
logic<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> same<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
logic and now we do the same or you do

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.969 
logic and now we do the same or you do
the<00:01:26.220> same<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.850> number<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.360> others

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
the same with this number and others

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.210 
the same with this number and others
five<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:29.970> first<00:01:30.180> power<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.479> 5<00:01:30.900> 5<00:01:31.560> times<00:01:31.920> 5

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
five to the first power is 5 5 times 5

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.319 
five to the first power is 5 5 times 5
is<00:01:32.430> 25

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
is 25

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.520 
is 25
this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> 125<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.509> 625<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.350> same

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this is 125 and here is 625 and the same

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.690 
this is 125 and here is 625 and the same
thing<00:01:37.740> happened<00:01:38.100> since<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.430> were<00:01:38.520> multiplying

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
thing happened since we were multiplying

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.749 
thing happened since we were multiplying
by<00:01:39.210> 5<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.259> each<00:01:40.439> step<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.700> way

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
by 5 in each step this way then this way

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
by 5 in each step this way then this way
we<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.150> dividing<00:01:42.540> by<00:01:42.570> 5<00:01:43.670> each<00:01:44.670> time<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we are dividing by 5 each time and in

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
we are dividing by 5 each time and in
this<00:01:48.420> step<00:01:48.630> also<00:01:48.860> we<00:01:49.860> divide<00:01:50.130> by<00:01:50.310> 5<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:52.100> 5

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this step also we divide by 5 and 5

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.580 
this step also we divide by 5 and 5
divided<00:01:53.399> by<00:01:53.520> 5<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.790> 1

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.999 

let's<00:01:58.369> look<00:01:58.579> at<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.060> little<00:01:59.210> bit<00:01:59.360> more<00:02:00.009> what

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
let's look at it a little bit more what

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.580 
let's look at it a little bit more what
would<00:02:01.490> seven<00:02:02.240> multiplied<00:02:02.899> by<00:02:03.110> itself

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
would seven multiplied by itself

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.870 
would seven multiplied by itself
zero<00:02:03.979> times<00:02:04.250> B<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:07.250> time<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.670> are<00:02:07.759> going

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
zero times B and this time we are going

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.120 
zero times B and this time we are going
to<00:02:07.970> use<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.539> law<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.349> multiplication<00:02:10.039> of

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
to use the law for multiplication of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.790 
to use the law for multiplication of
powers<00:02:10.720> students<00:02:11.720> assuming<00:02:12.380> students<00:02:12.709> have

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
powers students assuming students have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.220 
powers students assuming students have
already<00:02:13.130> studied<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:14.180> idea<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:15.019> if<00:02:15.140> you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
already studied this idea that if you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.320 
already studied this idea that if you
have<00:02:15.319> seven<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.769> third<00:02:15.860> power<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.640> 7<00:02:17.239> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
have seven to the third power and 7 to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.839 
have seven to the third power and 7 to
the<00:02:17.390> eighth<00:02:17.569> here's<00:02:18.080> 7<00:02:18.500> times<00:02:18.680> 7<00:02:18.950> times<00:02:19.099> 7<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
the eighth here's 7 times 7 times 7 and

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.600 
the eighth here's 7 times 7 times 7 and
here's<00:02:20.060> 7<00:02:20.870> multiplied<00:02:21.440> by<00:02:21.680> seven<00:02:22.010> eight<00:02:22.160> times

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
here's 7 multiplied by seven eight times

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.240 
here's 7 multiplied by seven eight times
so<00:02:23.030> surely<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> answer<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.260> 7<00:02:24.590> multiplied<00:02:25.069> by

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
so surely the answer is 7 multiplied by

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.720 
so surely the answer is 7 multiplied by
itself

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
itself

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.150 
itself
11<00:02:26.120> times<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.690> add<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.260> exponents<00:02:27.470> 3

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
11 times you just add the exponents 3

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.870 
11 times you just add the exponents 3
plus<00:02:28.550> 8<00:02:28.700> is<00:02:29.180> 11<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.440> using<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:30.920> with<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.340> 7<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
plus 8 is 11 so using this with the 7 to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.870 
plus 8 is 11 so using this with the 7 to
the<00:02:31.940> 0th<00:02:32.269> power<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.840> we<00:02:32.930> get<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.549> 7

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the 0th power what do we get we have 7

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.500 
the 0th power what do we get we have 7
to<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.590> power<00:02:36.590> 7<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.130> third<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.640> 7<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
to some power 7 to the third and 7 to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.570 
to some power 7 to the third and 7 to
the<00:02:38.600> DRF<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.410> add<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.920> exponents

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
the DRF and if we add the exponents

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.490 
the DRF and if we add the exponents
the<00:02:40.790> law<00:02:40.940> would<00:02:41.120> say<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.510> it's<00:02:41.780> 3<00:02:42.230> on<00:02:42.380> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the law would say that it's 3 on this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500 
the law would say that it's 3 on this
side<00:02:42.560> but<00:02:43.370> now<00:02:43.549> we<00:02:43.610> have<00:02:43.880> an<00:02:44.000> equation<00:02:44.299> here

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
side but now we have an equation here

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.839 
side but now we have an equation here
with<00:02:44.840> us<00:02:44.989> it's<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> same<00:02:45.500> number<00:02:45.769> here<00:02:46.040> the

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
with us it's the same number here the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.940 
with us it's the same number here the
same<00:02:47.060> number<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.739> number

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
same number here so this number

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.910 
same number here so this number
multiplied<00:02:49.580> by<00:02:49.730> what<00:02:49.970> gives<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:51.410> same<00:02:51.560> number

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
multiplied by what gives the same number

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
multiplied by what gives the same number
this<00:02:52.610> here<00:02:52.819> must<00:02:53.090> equal<00:02:54.370> 142<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.049> if<00:02:57.049> your

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
this here must equal 142 and if your

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.199 
this here must equal 142 and if your
students<00:02:57.650> are<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.280> level<00:02:58.640> then<00:02:58.790> by<00:02:59.180> all

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
students are to that level then by all

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.900 
students are to that level then by all
means<00:02:59.360> use<00:02:59.810> variables<00:03:00.799> also<00:03:01.190> instead<00:03:01.820> of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
means use variables also instead of

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.199 
means use variables also instead of
specific<00:03:02.510> numbers<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.079> have<00:03:04.070> X<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:05.030> some

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
specific numbers and have X to some

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.160 
specific numbers and have X to some
power<00:03:05.269> and<00:03:05.989> then<00:03:06.500> X<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.950> zeroth<00:03:07.280> power<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
power and then X to the zeroth power and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.750 
power and then X to the zeroth power and
when<00:03:09.170> you're<00:03:09.290> adding<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.709> exponents<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.370> plus

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.130 
when you're adding the exponents a plus
0<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.519> therefore<00:03:13.519> this<00:03:13.850> here<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.900> must

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
0 is a and therefore this here it must

0 is a and therefore this here it must

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
equal 1 because you have the same number

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.740 
equal 1 because you have the same number

the zero power equals 1 instead of just
