00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.379
 then all guys are alessandro lo 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.400
 junior 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.610
 in this video I would like to explain how 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 see free world of tanks then 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.949
 activate them or see them and how 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.660
 record them to maybe create videos 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 I do it because you ask me 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.949
 really very many even in the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.449
 old channel and therefore I want 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.720
 finally a ham voice and make a 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.969
 video in which I explain to you exactly how it is 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.450
 they do these things then prix everything 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.579
 I'd say start by explaining how 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 activating replays is really 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.460
 you have to go very simple 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 simply in the settings of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 world of tanks and you will find just the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.300
 voice ability recording of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.120
 battle 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.940
 you put the check on it is ok and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 from that point forward all the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840
 battles that a network later 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 when the check is enabled then 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.500
 those first course now the goals 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.880
 lost unless you saved a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.520
 other way 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.179
 all subsequent battles 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.819
 when the tick is enabled they will come 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.709
 recorded replays will be saved 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:26.940
 inside the folder just re place 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:28.319
 inside world of tanks usually in the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
 most cases and less than you 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.849
 you have not changed the address of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.399
 installation at kurt elling social world 

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.630
 of tanks found in c games world of 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.670
 tanks re place 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.200
 for example , I changed the sky to a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.179
 in other words, however, another point 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.789
 that should know where you have 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.950
 installed an internship at this point 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.340
 so that you know how the various replays e 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 where to find them saying that I got there 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.399
 time to talk 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:59.030
 and explain how to see them and then how 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.009
 register them well then here we are in 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 folder of the kings place where you play 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.820
 you obviously if you have just activated 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.080
 the tick will not have any though 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.280
 it is usually already activated by default 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.220
 so you should have some here are 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.140
 the replays run really take up very little 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 space so no need to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.700
 at least I don't delete them 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.800
 what you want but they really do 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.900
 we see very very little space anyway 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.060
 how to see them then in most 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 of the cases should be very simple 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.569
 a closed game then world of tanks 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.230
 it must be closed enough it will be enough to do 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.110
 double click 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.049
 in this case however for example as in the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.970
 my case since I did several 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.390
 King excerpts installations water 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.019
 installations of different beta and 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.019
 things like that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.569
 let's say replays are not associated 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.980
 to any program as you see there is 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.230
 this white sheet so if 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.290
 making more clicks he asks me with which one 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.610
 program I want to open them if you too 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.370
 you are in this situation however it is 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.560
 very simple indeed right button opened 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.630
 with open in this case because they are 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.079
 in English made brown ie leaf e 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.209
 look for revenue in the 36 world of tanks 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.300
 then look for your world card 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.030
 of tanks 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.980
 and then select the direct point file 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 ex world of tanks point ex not the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.880
 launcher the launcher what that one 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.980
 window that appears before you 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.690
 start playing where from here p 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.660
 download updates when they are there 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.930
 updates of the world of change 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.600
 ex point instead if then if you do 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.550
 starting the game from here just does 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560
 starting the game directly by jumping 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.640
 the window that is the launcher for 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 watch a replay you have to select 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.300
 this file here orrÃ¹ spence point ex ok 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.430
 so this is the first method the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.330
 second method instead is faster and can 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.240
 serve let's say if maybe two peaks 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.490
 versions of world of tanks installed 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.370
 or you have a version maybe 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 final is one that is a beta of one 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.020
 patch and you obviously want to open the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.520
 replay of a beta double click 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.440
 maybe ve lauper and with the version 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.820
 definitive of world of tanks and therefore 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.440
 don't let me see it 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.500
 then I open the list to one side 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.460
 of the replays on the other the 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.740
 world of tanks of the version suitable with 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.780
 who wants to understand the replay is 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.830
 simply take play and the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.390
 drag the world of tanks point ex e 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 he will veil it open with world of tanks 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.750
 just take out two 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.150
 say details of how much that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.560
 often replays of an old person 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.910
 of world of tanks do not work with 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.750
 the new one and therefore unfortunately not here 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.190
 there is a lot to do you should download 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.560
 the old an old version of world 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.120
 of tanks without making them do 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.250
 updates are then downloaded 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.580
 install it without ever starting it 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.190
 and then of course I use to watch from there i 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.110
 replay of the old versions was one 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.610
 a bit long though, however, he says that 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.100
 however wanted frank always have 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.140
 suffers big are 4 gig and then 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.360
 maybe not everyone wants to do it 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.660
 then the replay of old versions 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.270
 they work with these new ones 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:24.530
 you basically lost them 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.870
 having said that obviously it will seem war to you 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.900
 of kings that will show you the replay 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.670
 however it will not be a video file many mi 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.190
 they ask how I make videos 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.400
 this daytime airplay file franks 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.780
 they cannot be uploaded to youtube 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.340
 must be registered first 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.670
 now in this video I am not seeing you 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.400
 as I will tell you only what program you need 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.960
 then in short you see if you want to do it 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.890
 because maybe many are not interested in doing 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.480
 of the videos 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.640
 however after you have started the 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.530
 replay and that therefore world of will be opened 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.900
 france with rule of the game you will have to 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.640
 start a program like fraps calls 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
 cam and stuff like that 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.550
 started the fraps program for 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.280
 example a recording program 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.410
 then at that point you can record i 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.300
 replay let's say direct businesses while i 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.280
 replay bubble recorded maybe with a 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
 comment above at that point you have a 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.890
 video files that you can then edit 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.720
 render upload on youtube 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.450
 having said that and say that I have not finished 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.400
 there is much more to say as you are one 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.010
 very simple thing we say the 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.830
 replay management but you got me who 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.260
 he does so many in these years and therefore 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.580
 decided to make this video has been seen at 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.350
 all and obviously left a nice me 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.930
 like a comment sign up for the channel 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.460
 if you have any questions, maybe you don't 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.460
 something works you can't see 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.780
 a replay of course you write it 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.460
 known in the comments here entry 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.460
 prevention and bye bye bye bye
