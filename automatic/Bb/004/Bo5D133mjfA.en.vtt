brother<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.869> truly<00:01:58.229> an<00:01:58.439> intern<00:01:58.829> international

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
brother is truly an intern international

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.120 
brother is truly an intern international
production<00:02:00.180> which<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> led<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.439> Montreal

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
production which is led in Montreal

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
production which is led in Montreal
because<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> experience<00:02:03.000> at<00:02:03.479> first

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
because we have the experience at first

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.920 
because we have the experience at first
of<00:02:03.869> course<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.670> actually<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
of course and then we actually did a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.359 
of course and then we actually did a
little<00:02:07.079> bit<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.710> assassin's<00:02:08.159> creed

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
little bit of that with assassin's creed

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.469 
little bit of that with assassin's creed
two<00:02:08.519> so<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.759> had<00:02:08.879> some<00:02:09.060> previous<00:02:09.269> experience

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
two so we had some previous experience

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.679 
two so we had some previous experience
dealing<00:02:10.049> with<00:02:10.259> multiple<00:02:10.470> studios<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689 
dealing with multiple studios and

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.470 
dealing with multiple studios and
coordinating<00:02:12.689> activities<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.879> best<00:02:15.059> way<00:02:15.209> we

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
coordinating activities the best way we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.269 
coordinating activities the best way we
found<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.409> by<00:02:16.559> assigning<00:02:16.980> each

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:17.279 
found to do this is by assigning each

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.800 
found to do this is by assigning each
studio<00:02:17.669> a<00:02:17.849> very<00:02:18.120> specific

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
studio a very specific

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.770 
studio a very specific
and<00:02:18.930> eight<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.770> example<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.750> are

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and eight for example and see they are

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.710 
and eight for example and see they are
in<00:02:21.930> charge<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.349> doing<00:02:22.560> our<00:02:22.770> multiplayer<00:02:23.370> in

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
secret locations and so on so forth so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.670 
secret locations and so on so forth so
by<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.580> given<00:02:29.940> name<00:02:30.060> clear<00:02:30.450> objectives<00:02:31.080> it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
by the given name clear objectives it's

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.050 
by the given name clear objectives it's
easier<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> little<00:02:32.849> bit<00:02:33.000> of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
easier for them to have a little bit of

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.570 
easier for them to have a little bit of
ownership<00:02:33.420> over<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.290> they're

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
ownership over that so they're

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
ownership over that so they're
self-sufficient<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.780> do<00:02:36.930> is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
self-sufficient and all we have to do is

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.339 
self-sufficient and all we have to do is
follow<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.310> support<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.349> the

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
follow up and support them with the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.710 
follow up and support them with the
central<00:02:40.769> features<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.760> course<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> QA

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
central features and of course of the QA

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.290 
central features and of course of the QA
and<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:45.290> basically<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.890> infrastructure<00:02:47.640> for

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and the basically the infrastructure for

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.360 
and the basically the infrastructure for
assembling<00:02:49.110> all<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.349> pieces<00:02:49.680> together<00:02:50.010> at

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
assembling all the pieces together at

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
assembling all the pieces together at
the<00:02:50.519> end<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.239> worked<00:02:51.420> multiple<00:02:51.840> studios<00:02:52.410> we

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the end so we worked multiple studios we

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.070 
the end so we worked multiple studios we
work<00:02:52.739> with<00:02:52.950> an<00:02:53.160> EC<00:02:53.489> which<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.239> France<00:02:54.600> just

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
work with an EC which is in France just

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.880 
work with an EC which is in France just

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
by just south of geneve Geneva they are

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.949 
by just south of geneve Geneva they are
in<00:02:59.310> charge<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.940> multiplayer<00:03:00.510> so
