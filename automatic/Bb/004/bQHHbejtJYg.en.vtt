00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:25.239
 where we stop this tool called couto 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.330
 As you can see 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 very interesting very realistic 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.060
 it was done 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 effect even of rarities 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
 very interesting 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.570
 so let's start 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 sun heat of emotion 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 O 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 we will start the child the object 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
 in this case you have a plan 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.410
 creating full-time students 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.410
 increases 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.240
 the efec 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.520
 this effect is simple to do 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.060
 but lost the title 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.730
 what 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.530
 in the power 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.600
 it is impossible to do here the first of them this option here 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.370
 because we have to be calm 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.270
 prudent is that the sector is not open to criticism, let's click on it 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.990
 replica hands 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.080
 as well as object 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.969
 what causes us steering wheel like lol 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.950
 On the plane, let's crash. 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.909
 and for crediting 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.389
 so come on 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.319
 we will see 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 Let's see on the net here. 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.149
 tobi asks for tax 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.989
 4d cinema 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.679
 with uti for the ball 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.279
 to Ana 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.679
 the plan 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.009
 right 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.009
 after we expected the two leaders 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
 the years these two 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.079
 now 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.079
 let's start 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.539
 to redecard 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.539
 in the beginning I stay like this 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 but psd 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.259
 one thing 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.509
 not not very well as we planned 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.629
 So 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.629
 Let's believe it here. 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.869
 come on 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.939
 so let's start with ball 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.939
 get on your foot the olympic roth here 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:45.779

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.169
 the second interruption the same without 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.849
 the second option 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.219
 let's leave it 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.219
 100% also 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.489

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.199
 the thesis with 8% 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.119
 r 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.779
 which 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.219
 let's see in the state 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.219
 how did it go 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.249
 Fri 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.330
 as you can see 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.750
 The ball is older as I was. 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.330
 the tottenham 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330
 and has pressure but no gravity 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.340
 so she stays 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.689
 n 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.099
 Right there 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.330
 for example if as the sound increases 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.969
 she also practically together 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.969
 an example to 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.629
 interesting 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.089
 looks like 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.979
 water girl or something 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.069

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.199
 and there the Christians 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.370
