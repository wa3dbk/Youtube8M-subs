slightly images directly in the phone
and<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.430> much<00:00:30.640> more<00:00:30.910> so<00:00:31.840> I<00:00:32.109> will<00:00:32.320> start<00:00:32.559> with

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
and and much more so I will start with

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.860 
and and much more so I will start with
the<00:00:33.100> demonstrating<00:00:33.730> connect<00:00:33.969> to<00:00:34.090> Wi-Fi<00:00:34.420> and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
the demonstrating connect to Wi-Fi and

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.799 
the demonstrating connect to Wi-Fi and
then<00:00:35.079> Bluetooth<00:00:35.789> what<00:00:36.789> you<00:00:36.909> should<00:00:37.149> do<00:00:37.359> before

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
then Bluetooth what you should do before

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.099 
then Bluetooth what you should do before
connecting<00:00:38.319> is<00:00:38.679> selecting<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.899> connect<00:00:40.899> mode

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
connecting is selecting the connect mode

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.369 
connecting is selecting the connect mode
for<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.159> Y<00:00:42.339> for<00:00:42.399> demo<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.120> will<00:00:43.239> show<00:00:43.510> number

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
for the Y for demo I will show number

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.229 
for the Y for demo I will show number
one<00:00:44.589> so<00:00:45.100> Dom<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:46.329> then<00:00:46.809> connect<00:00:47.229> Wi-Fi<00:00:48.239> you

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
one so Dom and then connect Wi-Fi you

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.539 
one so Dom and then connect Wi-Fi you
see<00:00:49.449> here<00:00:49.659> that<00:00:49.839> it<00:00:50.019> won't<00:00:50.289> automatically<00:00:51.100> the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
see here that it won't automatically the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.599 
see here that it won't automatically the
PC<00:00:51.760> Shermer<00:00:52.299> so<00:00:52.659> no<00:00:52.960> user<00:00:53.649> configuration<00:00:54.460> is

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
PC Shermer so no user configuration is

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.449 
PC Shermer so no user configuration is
needed<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.269> connect<00:00:55.629> just<00:00:55.839> plugging<00:00:56.170> claim<00:00:56.530> so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:57.459 
needed to connect just plugging claim so

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:02.430 
needed to connect just plugging claim so
I'm<00:00:57.579> selecting<00:00:57.760> this<00:00:58.149> one<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:01.049> then<00:01:02.049> it<00:01:02.199> sends

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
I'm selecting this one and then it sends

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.580 
I'm selecting this one and then it sends
all<00:01:02.799> these<00:01:03.129> slides<00:01:03.429> from<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.210> PC<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.780> do<00:01:05.409> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
all these slides from the PC to do the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.790 
all these slides from the PC to do the
phone<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.909> connect<00:01:07.240> mode<00:01:07.420> one

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
phone and this is the connect mode one

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.200 
phone and this is the connect mode one
the<00:01:08.800> reason<00:01:09.190> we<00:01:09.310> have<00:01:09.580> different<00:01:09.940> connect

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
the reason we have different connect

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
the reason we have different connect
modes<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:11.410> will<00:01:11.560> have<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.800> best

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
modes is you will have the best

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.910 
modes is you will have the best
presentation<00:01:13.060> experience<00:01:13.600> depending<00:01:14.050> off<00:01:14.230> if

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
presentation experience depending off if

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.650 
presentation experience depending off if
you<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.220> smaller<00:01:15.520> presentation<00:01:16.360> or<00:01:16.480> big

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
you have a smaller presentation or big

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.140 
you have a smaller presentation or big
one<00:01:16.960> or<00:01:17.200> if<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.410> have<00:01:17.530> bad<00:01:17.740> or<00:01:18.520> guilty<00:01:18.700> plea<00:01:19.030> to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
one or if you have bad or guilty plea to

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.780 
one or if you have bad or guilty plea to
the<00:01:19.180> Wi-Fi<00:01:19.630> connection<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.340> cannot

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
the Wi-Fi connection so you cannot

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.700 
the Wi-Fi connection so you cannot
select<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.420> connect<00:01:22.690> told<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:23.440> want<00:01:23.650> to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
select the connect told you you want to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.450 
select the connect told you you want to
use<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.600> now<00:01:25.750> we<00:01:25.810> are<00:01:26.050> running<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:26.860> very

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
use so now we are running you can very

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.940 
use so now we are running you can very
easily<00:01:27.550> let's<00:01:28.300> change<00:01:28.570> this<00:01:28.780> one<00:01:28.840> like<00:01:29.680> this

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
easily let's change this one like this

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.190 
easily let's change this one like this
yes<00:01:30.250> what<00:01:31.080> we<00:01:32.080> just<00:01:32.280> tapped<00:01:33.510> you<00:01:34.510> can<00:01:34.690> also<00:01:34.870> use

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
yes what we just tapped you can also use

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.950 
yes what we just tapped you can also use
the<00:01:35.530> forward<00:01:36.370> button<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.300> volume<00:01:37.450> button

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the forward button the volume button

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.490 
the forward button the volume button
like<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.640> very<00:01:39.700> easy<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.170> also

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
like this it's very easy you can also

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.200 
like this it's very easy you can also
see<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.130> if<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.310> change<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.760> slide<00:01:43.000> on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
see that the if you change the slide on

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.950 
see that the if you change the slide on
the<00:01:43.360> PC<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.020> then<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.680> phone<00:01:45.180> follows<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.870> you

the PC and then the phone follows so you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.660 
the PC and then the phone follows so you
will<00:01:47.140> never<00:01:47.260> lose<00:01:47.550> synchronization<00:01:48.550> between

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
will never lose synchronization between

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.470 
will never lose synchronization between
the<00:01:49.060> PC<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.050> third<00:01:50.760> you<00:01:51.760> switch<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> notes
