00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the pilot well this is a very different

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810 
the pilot well this is a very different
airplane<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.260> too<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.820> handles

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
airplane for me too it handles

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
airplane for me too it handles
differently<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> high<00:00:34.020> time<00:00:34.320> tail

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
differently I'm not a high time tail

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
differently I'm not a high time tail
dragger<00:00:35.280> pilot<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> course<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
dragger pilot and this is of course a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.450 
dragger pilot and this is of course a
tail<00:00:36.719> dragger<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.710> challenge<00:00:37.950> for

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
tail dragger so that's a challenge for

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
tail dragger so that's a challenge for
me<00:00:38.610> as<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.750> sit<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.200> behind<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
me as you can see you sit way behind the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.549 
me as you can see you sit way behind the
wing<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> sight<00:00:42.719> picture<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
wing and so the sight picture is quite a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
wing and so the sight picture is quite a
bit<00:00:43.860> different<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.820> course<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.420> big

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
bit different and of course if this big

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.119 
bit different and of course if this big
long<00:00:45.930> nose<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.489> forward<00:00:48.000> visibility

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
long nose you your forward visibility

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
long nose you your forward visibility
particularly<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.250> slow<00:00:50.579> speed<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
particularly at slow speed is is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
particularly at slow speed is is
impaired<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.000> likes

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
impaired just a little bit but it likes

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
impaired just a little bit but it likes
to<00:00:54.329> fly<00:00:54.600> fast<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.559> light

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to fly fast and and it it is very light

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
to fly fast and and it it is very light
on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> controls<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.960> actually

to<00:01:50.759> mass<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:50.970> each<00:01:51.240> other<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.780> forth<00:01:51.810> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to mass on each other and so forth but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
to mass on each other and so forth but
it's<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:53.759> want<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it's you what you really want is a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.380 
it's you what you really want is a
boring<00:01:54.689> race<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.350> you're<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> pilot

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
boring race if you're the pilot

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.569 
boring race if you're the pilot
so<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.200> concentrate<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.130> line<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
so you just concentrate on your line and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.980 
so you just concentrate on your line and
concentrate<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.180> keeping<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> airplane

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
concentrate on keeping the airplane

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.730 
concentrate on keeping the airplane
moving<00:02:01.290> fast

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
moving fast

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
moving fast
you<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.850> aircraft<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.329> understand

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you know this aircraft if I understand

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.350 
you know this aircraft if I understand
correctly<00:02:03.689> has<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.619> motor<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.700> car<00:02:05.880> motor<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.270> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
correctly has a motor a car motor in it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.580 
correctly has a motor a car motor in it
is<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.659> right<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.229> has<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
is that right or is that has that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.749 
is that right or is that has that
changed<00:02:07.740> what's<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> power<00:02:08.369> plan<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
changed what's the power plan on this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.750 
changed what's the power plan on this
aircraft<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.470> unusual<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
aircraft it's very unusual it's the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
aircraft it's very unusual it's the
airplane<00:02:12.150> was<00:02:12.330> designed<00:02:12.440> around

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
airplane was designed around

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.940 
airplane was designed around

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and and that's what that's what's in it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.750 
and and that's what that's what's in it
it<00:02:20.490> has<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> gearbox<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.810> reduces<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.980> engine

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it has a gearbox that reduces the engine

of what the engine rpm is running so I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.360 
of what the engine rpm is running so I
turn<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.890> engine<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.700> fast<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> for<00:02:35.280> an

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
turn the engine really fast for a for an

territory<00:02:58.730> Lee<00:02:59.730> where<00:02:59.910> do<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.030> top<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.390> with

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
territory Lee where do you top out with

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
territory Lee where do you top out with
with<00:03:01.170> air<00:03:01.410> speed<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.190> know<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> miles<00:03:02.519> per<00:03:02.700> hour

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
with air speed you know a miles per hour

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.490 
with air speed you know a miles per hour
maybe<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:03.390> instead<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.080> knots<00:03:04.290> what

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
maybe something instead of knots what

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.290 
maybe something instead of knots what
was<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.769> top<00:03:04.890> speed<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.640> last<00:03:05.880> year<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.120> was

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
was your top speed so last year I was

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.050 
was your top speed so last year I was
able<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> qualify<00:03:07.050> at<00:03:07.400> 363<00:03:08.400> miles<00:03:08.640> an<00:03:08.910> hour

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
able to qualify at 363 miles an hour

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.210 
able to qualify at 363 miles an hour
this<00:03:09.480> year<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.780> expect<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.800> little<00:03:11.069> bit

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
this year I expect to do a little bit

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.590 
this year I expect to do a little bit
better<00:03:11.400> than<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.700> we've<00:03:12.000> done<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> couple<00:03:12.420> of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
better than that we've done a couple of

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.380 
better than that we've done a couple of
modifications<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:14.610> engine<00:03:14.760> induction

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
modifications to the engine induction

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.289 
modifications to the engine induction
system<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.370> gearbox<00:03:17.610> to

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
system and the and the gearbox to

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.830 
system and the and the gearbox to
scavenge<00:03:18.900> oil<00:03:19.200> better<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.829> I'm<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.690> think

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
scavenge oil better and I'm I I think

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.080 
scavenge oil better and I'm I I think
the<00:03:22.410> airplanes<00:03:22.829> capable<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.549> qualifying

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
won't win you got to be over 400 but you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.580 
won't win you got to be over 400 but you
know<00:03:29.850> we're<00:03:30.030> creeping<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:30.989> if<00:03:31.440> we

know we're creeping up on it and if we
do<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:32.040> little<00:03:32.100> better<00:03:32.400> each<00:03:32.670> year<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:33.299> we're

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
do a little better each year then we're

comfortable that I'm very long-legged

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.340 
comfortable that I'm very long-legged
and<00:04:32.460> they<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.789> seat<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.389> rudder<00:04:33.930> pedals

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and they the seat and the rudder pedals

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.230 
and they the seat and the rudder pedals
and<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:34.710> forth<00:04:34.979> are<00:04:35.190> such<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.729> I've<00:04:35.910> got<00:04:36.090> my

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
and so forth are such that I've got my

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.740 
and so forth are such that I've got my
legs<00:04:36.479> out<00:04:36.660> straight<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:37.139> front<00:04:37.319> of<00:04:37.590> me<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.750> so

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
legs out straight in front of me and so

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.150 
legs out straight in front of me and so
that<00:04:40.319> part's<00:04:40.650> great<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:43.050> only<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.860> only

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
that part's great it the only the only

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.820 
that part's great it the only the only
issue<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.120> tiny<00:04:45.750> bit<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.110> anxiety<00:04:46.710> to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
issue is just the tiny bit of anxiety to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.770 
issue is just the tiny bit of anxiety to
make<00:04:47.069> sure<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.580> all<00:04:47.610> holds<00:04:48.120> together<00:04:48.270> and

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
make sure that it all holds together and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.089 
make sure that it all holds together and
that<00:04:48.870> you<00:04:49.020> aren't<00:04:49.259> going<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.440> suddenly<00:04:49.650> become

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
that you aren't going to suddenly become

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.850 
that you aren't going to suddenly become
a<00:04:50.130> glider<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.630> airplane<00:04:52.080> does<00:04:52.319> not<00:04:52.500> have

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
a glider so this airplane does not have

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.850 
a glider so this airplane does not have
the<00:04:53.430> same<00:04:53.970> redundancies<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:54.930> an<00:04:55.650> air<00:04:55.830> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the same redundancies that an air that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.640 
the same redundancies that an air that
most<00:04:56.550> airplanes<00:04:56.880> would<00:04:57.180> have<00:04:57.389> so<00:04:57.780> instead<00:04:58.590> of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
most airplanes would have so instead of

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.100 
most airplanes would have so instead of
having<00:04:58.889> two<00:04:59.340> ignition<00:04:59.849> systems<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.599> being

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
having two ignition systems and being

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.469 
having two ignition systems and being
able<00:05:01.320> to<00:05:01.470> run<00:05:01.710> on<00:05:01.889> one<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:03.000> only<00:05:03.150> has<00:05:03.449> one

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
able to run on one it only has one

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.930 
able to run on one it only has one
ignition<00:05:04.139> system<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.830> only<00:05:04.979> has<00:05:05.250> one<00:05:05.280> battery

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
ignition system it only has one battery

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.070 
ignition system it only has one battery
it<00:05:06.270> only<00:05:06.419> has<00:05:06.690> one<00:05:06.720> alternator<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.870> has

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
it only has one alternator it it has

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.550 
it only has one alternator it it has
electronic<00:05:10.830> fuel<00:05:11.250> injection<00:05:11.449> so<00:05:12.449> any<00:05:12.960> kind<00:05:13.410> of

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
electronic fuel injection so any kind of

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.439 
electronic fuel injection so any kind of
electrical<00:05:14.130> problem<00:05:14.669> turns<00:05:14.940> me<00:05:15.180> into<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
electrical problem turns me into a

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.260 
electrical problem turns me into a
glider<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.070> I<00:05:17.070> just<00:05:17.669> have<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.849> be<00:05:18.000> aware<00:05:18.210> of

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
glider and I just have to be aware of

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.629 
glider and I just have to be aware of
that<00:05:18.449> and<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.320> will<00:05:19.860> tell<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.340> glides

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
that and I will tell you it glides

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.469 
that and I will tell you it glides
really<00:05:21.030> well

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
really well

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.520 
really well
and<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:23.610> at<00:05:24.539> least<00:05:24.630> it'll<00:05:25.050> give<00:05:25.199> me<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.319> lot

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
and it so at least it'll give me a lot

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.659 
and it so at least it'll give me a lot
of<00:05:25.680> time<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.009> pick<00:05:26.159> a<00:05:26.220> spot<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:29.430> forth

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
of time to pick a spot and and so forth

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.300 
of time to pick a spot and and so forth
so<00:05:30.409> well<00:05:31.409> Leigh<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:31.740> appreciate<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.220> spending
