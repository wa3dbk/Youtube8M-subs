00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 two 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.600
 a house that looks like another planet but 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 is in complete harmony with the 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.560
 nature that surrounds it 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.690
 there was no need to dynamite rocks or knock down 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.690
 to trees to build it 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.430
 that was important to me the end that 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.110
 he built his dream house in the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 art region made in southern 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.570
 France with the help of his wife 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.510
 Welcome to our house of walls 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.949
 it took 36 years to build it and I'm 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 happy to show them 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.700
 joel one to planned the house until the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.670
 detail including 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.190
 position of the sun throughout the year 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.120
 habitable spheres were added from 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.120
 organic form 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 our these always have form 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 curve and not rectangular this house is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
 corresponds with the movements 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 of the hand we make 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 intuitively 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.050
 it's much more pleasant to live in a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.890
 surroundings of curved lines that in cubes 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.890
 rectangular 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.189
 to model the house joel a developed 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.189
 your own method 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.380
 an iron framework shapes the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.800
 house that is conceived as a 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.020
 sculpture I use 10 iron rods 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.120
 millimeters thick as a finger 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 small when the skeleton is 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.610
 finished the inside is lined by 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.130
 a grate the skeleton and the grate is 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.460
 they cover everything by hand with cement 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.460
 He passed 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.130
 This bay has more than 100 years 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 pool was built around it 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.440
 water tank refilled the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 sustainability is an essential part of 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.910
 concept 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.850
 the interior of the house with its spaces 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.630
 open offers many corners to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.630
 retire to rest 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.510
 planning a spherical house is like 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.790
 work with a living organism the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.080
 transitions between the rooms are 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.470
 fluid instead of doors there are 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.980
 openings 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.580
 we have very few doors in the house 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 but more than 65 openings abroad is 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.040
 important to have good views of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 landscape 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.330
 when the works began in 1972 here 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.490
 no water or electricity arrived 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.790
 marriage one to had to organize it 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.790
 all 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.160
 Most of the furniture is recessed 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.300
 There is little space to store things but 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.710
 many places that invite you to dream like 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.710
 the old children's piece 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.340
 we limit ourselves to the essentials normally 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.190
 in a house one has too many things 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.460
 that has been accumulating with the passage of 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.460
 time the limited side 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.340
 the last sphere that was added was this 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.530
 bathroom for guests 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.030
 thanks to this house I the one is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.580
 known as a specialist in 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.140
 constructions with iron mesh and has 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.819
 worked for renowned architects 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.819
 like the italian renzo piano 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.469
 in 1981 I wrote my first book 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.930
 33 years ago but not a week goes by 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:19.440
 without someone call me to ask me 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.900
 advice 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 it's amazing that to this day 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.940
 there are people who are interested in me 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.080
 technique and use my book as a guide for 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.080
 build your house 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.690
 I the mole is a visionary who never 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.610
 he surrendered or spared no effort and that's how 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.230
 like the dream of building your own 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.230
 home came out round
