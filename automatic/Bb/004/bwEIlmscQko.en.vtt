00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
Princeton sea air brake inspection from

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.620 
Princeton sea air brake inspection from
the<00:00:32.040> inside<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> cab<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:35.329> from<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
the inside the cab and from there the
in-cab<00:00:37.079> inspection<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.309> air

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
in-cab inspection from there the air

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
in-cab inspection from there the air
brake<00:00:39.270> inspection<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.500> everything<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.100> now

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
brake inspection so everything right now

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
brake inspection so everything right now
happened<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.879> inside<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.480> cab<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.440> what

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
happened to be inside the cab so what

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.940 
happened to be inside the cab so what
did<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> instructor<00:00:44.969> who<00:00:45.120> said<00:00:45.420> was

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
did with the instructor who said was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.590 
did with the instructor who said was
that<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.100> cannot<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.760> anything<00:00:48.090> wrong<00:00:48.390> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that we cannot get anything wrong on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
that we cannot get anything wrong on
this<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> mess<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.730> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
this one if we mess up on any one of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
this one if we mess up on any one of
those<00:00:50.969> tests<00:00:51.300> from<00:00:51.390> inside<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.780> cab<00:00:52.050> then

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
those tests from inside the cab then

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.319 
those tests from inside the cab then
forget<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.239> no

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
forget about it because there's no

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
forget about it because there's no
leeway<00:00:54.570> there's<00:00:55.559> no<00:00:55.710> there's<00:00:56.010> no<00:00:56.070> variances

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
leeway there's no there's no variances

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
leeway there's no there's no variances
or<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.809> any<00:00:58.109> air<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.600> I'm<00:01:00.600> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
or we can have any air so I'm really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
or we can have any air so I'm really
just<00:01:00.989> trying<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> study<00:01:01.440> hard<00:01:01.739> I've<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just trying to study hard I've got the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020 
just trying to study hard I've got the
DVD<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> where<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.379> watch<00:01:04.680> him<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
DVD to where I can watch him do it and I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.850 
DVD to where I can watch him do it and I
think<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.140> good<00:01:07.470> handle<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
think I got a pretty good handle on it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
think I got a pretty good handle on it
but<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> course<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.850> next<00:01:12.090> day

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
but of course you know that the next day

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.960 
but of course you know that the next day
I<00:01:12.210> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> work<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.290> maneuvers

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
I need to work on is out my maneuvers

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
I need to work on is out my maneuvers
right<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.509> doing<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.780> one

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
right now I think I'm doing this one

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
right now I think I'm doing this one
that's<00:01:16.140> called<00:01:16.380> docking<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that's called docking and it's kind of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
that's called docking and it's kind of
almost<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> 90-degree<00:01:20.729> almost

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
almost like a like a 90-degree almost

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
almost like a like a 90-degree almost
like<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> big<00:01:21.720> half<00:01:21.960> circle<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
like I do a big half circle and then I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
like I do a big half circle and then I
got<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.460> back<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> cones<00:01:24.500> it's

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
got it back back into the cones it's

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
got it back back into the cones it's
pretty<00:01:25.710> tricky<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> guess<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.530> body

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
pretty tricky but I guess it's just body

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
pretty tricky but I guess it's just body
mechanics<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.579> training<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.570> body<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.990> know

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
mechanics and training your body to know

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.590 
mechanics and training your body to know
exactly<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> turn<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.700> left<00:01:33.210> goes<00:01:33.390> right

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
exactly when to turn and left goes right

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
exactly when to turn and left goes right
and<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:33.900> goes<00:01:34.110> left<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.530> however<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and right goes left or however that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
and right goes left or however that
works<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.490> still<00:01:35.670> having<00:01:35.880> guided<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
works I still having guided down all the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.149 
works I still having guided down all the
way<00:01:36.570> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
way but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.359 
way but
I'm<00:01:38.219> taking<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.579> day<00:01:38.729> by<00:01:38.880> day<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:40.369> just

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I'm taking the day by day and just

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.809 
I'm taking the day by day and just
studying<00:01:41.880> hard<00:01:42.149> training<00:01:42.450> hard<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.670> make

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819

I<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.770> excel<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> hopefully

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
I can be so I can excel and hopefully

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.029 
I can be so I can excel and hopefully
you<00:01:50.789> know<00:01:50.939> get<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.659> road<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.140> start

you know get on the road and start
actually<00:01:53.159> making<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.670> money<00:01:55.100> think<00:01:58.099> that's

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
actually making some money think that's

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.760 
actually making some money think that's
it<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:00.990> tired<00:02:01.229> making

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it for now so a little bit tired making

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
it for now so a little bit tired making
the<00:02:01.829> drives<00:02:02.099> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.670> over<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.060> curl<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the drives you know all over to curl to
