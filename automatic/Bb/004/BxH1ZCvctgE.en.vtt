Today, we're gonna type the loop knot that
I use for all my fishing, it's the canoeman

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.680
loop knot. And I like to start this knot before
I put the lure on and you can put the lure

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.949
on first, I'll show you that in a minute.It's
really one of the easiest loop knots there

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.790
is. I've never had it come apart on me. I
start with the line in my right hand the tag

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.750
end would go in my left hand 'casue I'm right
handed and what I'm gonna do is make a loop

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.620
by putting my right hand behind my left hand,
right behind the left gonna make a loop pinch

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.160
that one off in my left hand. Next step is
I'm gonna make an identical loop by putting

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.200
the that one off with my right hand. It does notright behind the left again gonna pinch

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.280
matter what size these loops are. The third
step is to put the right loop through the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.020
left loop. Just gonna put it through from
front to back. Now lift up my right index

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.949
finger just pinch this off it will all stay
together. Now is when I get my lure which

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.729
I've usually been holding in that hand, put
it on, I'm gonna take this tag end and put

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.079
it from the bottom up through what originally
was that right hand loop. Point it back down

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.899
towards the lure, it's very important. Then
I can let all this go, pull up, and it instantly

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.819
forms that loop. It's a quick and easy knot.
I'll tie it once now with the lure already

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.719
on. If that's the way you'd rather start.
And I'll show you how fast it is, I'll do

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.219
it a little quicker this time. So if you wanna
start with the lure on you start with it threaded

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:52.169
on there and I still hold the lure in my left
hand. I make a right behind the left, right

00:01:52.169 --> 00:02:00.380
behind the left, the right through the left,
pinch it off, put it from bottom to the top,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.579
point it back down towards the lure let everything
go and pull on it and there's your loop. It's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.580
a nice fast loop. And because the tag end
points backwards it won't catch grass or weeds

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.569
and I highly recommend you give that knot
a try.
