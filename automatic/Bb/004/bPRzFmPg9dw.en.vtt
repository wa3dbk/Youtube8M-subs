00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.200
 Real Valladolid and Levante gave me their 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.949
 forces in the party that opened the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.619
 day 25 of the league bbva the set 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.449
 vallisoletano the local team started in 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.460
 descent positions but knowing that in 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.740
 case of winning could tie so 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.770
 provisional with the málaga the team that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.780
 marks the border between salvation and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.610
 the descent or that at least marked it in 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.050
 the start of this day the lift 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.460
 another team that also fights for 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.370
 stay at first came in a 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.670
 much more comfortable situation with a 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.609
 very remarkable advantage over the posts 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.620
 of descent in fact I was with 32 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.629
 points before this match the lift 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.399
 we see the first occasion in this 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.659
 rukavina driving that leaves for 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.670
 javi war and the shot from the 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.550
 vertex of the front area of the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.370
 valladolid caught him at keylor navas 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.889
 another one for the blanquivioleta set 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.510
 in this shot of the lateral rock that 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.510
 marched slightly deviated 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.120
 the valladolid dominated the front possession 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.730
 to a lift that I hope 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.070
 back very well placed as always with 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.750
 a strong defense and waiting for his 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.000
 opportunity came in this minute action 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.800
 25 Ivan's serve 7 goal from 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.810
 Viktor Casadesus the first one to write down 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.480
 in his new stage as a player of 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.070
 Levante has already become nothing more 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.100
 arrive in an indisputable to caparrós 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 who re-aligned him in the eleven as 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.020
 second point behind david barral 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.760
 and responded to that trust with his 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.580
 first goal as a player to lift this 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.710
 good header that put the 0-1 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.500
 on the scoreboard at that 25 minute of the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.550
 first part 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.440
 we are already seeing the best moves of 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.120
 the second half where he had to 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.190
 replicate the real valladolid had to 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.020
 search for 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.770
 the tie to get into the fight for 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 the victory 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.170
 in this action that minute goal would arrive 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 51 of the second part and in one action 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.399
 that it seemed was not going to entail any 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.849
 type of danger for the release because 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.560
 every time he was embarking more each 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.799
 time the day seemed greater within the area 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.540
 in the end he ends up picking up that ball 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.540
 javi guerra took a left-footed shot 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.270
 what bounces on an opponent can not 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.420
 take 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.739
 lukas vintra and in the end the ball 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.420
 ends up entering the Levante goal 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.040
 was the tie to one in the match you were 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.870
 opened there the possibility to the real 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.970
 valladolid to fight for that longed for 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.150
 victory and in fact he searched hard 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.770
 the set of Juan Ignacio Martínez with 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.140
 more will that opportunities 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.790
 clear valderrama working hard from 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.319
 the left band left for osorio and 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.420
 the shot of the Colombian was leaving 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.050
 deviated to the left of the goal 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.230
 defended by keylor navas 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.620
 with the passage of the minutes the lift 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.890
 and will be satisfied with that draw outside of 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.370
 house debuted by the way as cissokho that 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.860
 received many from the stands because 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.940
 passed the medical review with the real 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.650
 Valladolid in this winter market 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.049
 but in the end he decided to sign for the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.420
 Levante was remembered by fans 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.020
 of the Pucelano set that every time 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.080
 touched the ball 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.460
 they gave away whistles at the end of that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.170
 match in puce tied to one that 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.480
 content more to the east than to 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.740
 Valladolid that will continue in the area of 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.630
 descent at the end in the new joseph 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.630
