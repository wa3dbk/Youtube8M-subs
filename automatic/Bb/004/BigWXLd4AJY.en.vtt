people enjoyed looking at up in the
Intel<00:00:06.480> lattice<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:06.950> our<00:00:07.950> project<00:00:08.370> brief<00:00:08.550> was

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Intel lattice now our project brief was

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.970 
Intel lattice now our project brief was
to<00:00:08.880> design<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.809> robotic<00:00:10.320> chess<00:00:10.500> board<00:00:10.740> where

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
to design a robotic chess board where

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.290 
to design a robotic chess board where
you<00:00:11.190> can<00:00:11.340> move<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.519> pieces<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.269> board

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you can move your pieces on the board

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
you can move your pieces on the board
and<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> opponent's<00:00:13.320> pieces<00:00:13.469> move

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and have the opponent's pieces move

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.259 
and have the opponent's pieces move
themselves<00:00:13.920> automatically<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.849> response<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
themselves automatically in response to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.880 
themselves automatically in response to
your<00:00:15.360> moves<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:16.500> pretty<00:00:16.830> much

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
your moves and that's pretty much

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.760 
your moves and that's pretty much
exactly<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.430> we've<00:00:17.550> done<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> main<00:00:19.350> idea<00:00:19.529> we

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
exactly what we've done the main idea we

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.900 
exactly what we've done the main idea we
wanted<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.039> keep<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.279> our<00:00:20.369> minds<00:00:20.609> while<00:00:20.820> we

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
wanted to keep in our minds while we

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.130 
wanted to keep in our minds while we
were<00:00:20.970> building<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.390> thing<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.900> want<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
were building this thing was we want the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
were building this thing was we want the
final<00:00:22.410> product<00:00:22.590> today<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.070> much<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.519> playing

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
final product today is much like playing

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
final product today is much like playing
a<00:00:23.850> normal<00:00:24.150> game<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> chess<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> normal<00:00:24.960> chess

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
a normal game of chess on a normal chess

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.810 
a normal game of chess on a normal chess
board<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.529> possible<00:00:25.920> obviously<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
board as possible obviously with the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.849 
board as possible obviously with the
added<00:00:27.119> robotic<00:00:27.480> components<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:28.800> are

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
added robotic components and there are

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.950 
added robotic components and there are
four<00:00:29.010> main<00:00:29.189> parts<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> system<00:00:29.939> first<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
four main parts to the system first of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.209 
four main parts to the system first of
all<00:00:31.019> there's<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> actual<00:00:31.769> hardware<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
all there's the actual hardware that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.410 
all there's the actual hardware that
houses<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.610> board<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> components

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
houses the board and all the components

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.319 
houses the board and all the components
the<00:00:34.079> table<00:00:34.410> itself<00:00:35.000> then<00:00:36.000> we've<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the table itself then we've got the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.690 
the table itself then we've got the
image<00:00:37.020> recognition<00:00:37.230> which<00:00:37.800> works<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.489> where

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
image recognition which works out where

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.250 
image recognition which works out where
all<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> pieces<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> board<00:00:39.660> using<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
all the pieces are on the board using a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
all the pieces are on the board using a
camera<00:00:40.530> which<00:00:40.860> I'll<00:00:41.040> talk<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.460> more<00:00:41.489> about

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
camera which I'll talk a bit more about

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.959 
camera which I'll talk a bit more about
later<00:00:42.320> then<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.129> move<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.700> pieces

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
later then we have to move the pieces

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.190 
later then we have to move the pieces
around<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> board<00:00:45.450> obviously<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.050> that's

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
around the board obviously so that's

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
around the board obviously so that's
hardware<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.760> need<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
hardware to do that and then we need to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.459 
hardware to do that and then we need to
be<00:00:48.210> able<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.570> play<00:00:48.899> chess<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.170> make

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
be able to actually play chess and make

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
be able to actually play chess and make
valid<00:00:49.739> chess<00:00:49.920> moves<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> system<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
valid chess moves so we have a system to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
valid chess moves so we have a system to
do<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.629> well<00:00:52.399> first<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.579> there's<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
do that as well first of all there's the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
do that as well first of all there's the
table<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.360> you've<00:00:54.539> seen<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> sporting<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
table as you've seen it sporting it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.790 
table as you've seen it sporting it's
rather<00:00:55.800> fashionable<00:00:56.039> skirt<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> i'll<00:00:58.770> just

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
rather fashionable skirt so i'll just

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.080 
rather fashionable skirt so i'll just
show<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> few<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> main<00:00:59.609> components<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
show you a few of the main components of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
show you a few of the main components of
the<00:01:00.180> table<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> actual<00:01:01.530> hardware<00:01:01.949> first

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the table and the actual hardware first

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
the table and the actual hardware first
of<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> left<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.260> are

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
of all on the left you can see there are

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.570 
of all on the left you can see there are
the<00:01:04.439> connections<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.070> link<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the connections that link it up to the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.770 
the connections that link it up to the
computer<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.090> runs<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> control

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
computer that runs all the control

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
computer that runs all the control
software<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> chess<00:01:07.560> software<00:01:07.710> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
software and the chess software that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.170 
software and the chess software that
tells<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.610> supposed<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.939> doing

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
tells it what it's supposed to be doing

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.820 
tells it what it's supposed to be doing
you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can just about see down there the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.289 
you can just about see down there the
camera<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.310> observes<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> board<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
camera which observes the board and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
camera which observes the board and
works<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.600> where<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> pieces<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
works out where all the pieces are and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
works out where all the pieces are and
there's<00:01:14.070> some<00:01:14.189> strip<00:01:14.400> lighting<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
there's some strip lighting in there to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.940 
there's some strip lighting in there to
make<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> nice<00:01:15.810> lighting<00:01:16.320> conditions<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
make a nice lighting conditions for the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
make a nice lighting conditions for the
camera<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> also<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.090> looks<00:01:18.299> quite<00:01:18.570> cool

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
camera and also it looks quite cool

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.700 
camera and also it looks quite cool
because<00:01:19.020> they're<00:01:19.229> coming<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.530> from

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
because they're coming out from

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.539 
because they're coming out from
underneath<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> how's<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> police<00:01:23.100> detection

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
underneath so how's the police detection

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.920 
underneath so how's the police detection
work<00:01:23.700> first<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.360> we've<00:01:24.509> got<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> camera

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
work first of all we've got the camera

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
work first of all we've got the camera
mounted<00:01:25.259> under<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> board<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:26.009> takes<00:01:26.520> an

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
mounted under the board which takes an

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
mounted under the board which takes an
image<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.780> are<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:27.960> main<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
image and there are two main things that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.870 
image and there are two main things that
it<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.979> able<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.430> has<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> first

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it has to be able to do it has the first

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.550 
it has to be able to do it has the first
of<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.090> tell<00:01:30.240> whether<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.930> square<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.259> empty<00:01:31.530> or

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
of all tell whether a square is empty or

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
of all tell whether a square is empty or
full<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.579> full<00:01:32.759> whether<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> piece

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
full and if it's full whether the piece

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.609 
full and if it's full whether the piece
on<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.720> black<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.079> white<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> that's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
on it is black or white and that's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.440 
on it is black or white and that's
enough<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.460> rid<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:35.820> ambiguity<00:01:36.360> about

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
enough to get rid of any ambiguity about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.850 
enough to get rid of any ambiguity about
the<00:01:36.659> board<00:01:36.840> state<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.320> moves<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.680> done

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the board state and what moves been done

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
the board state and what moves been done
so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> by<00:01:39.060> coloring<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> bottom<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so we do that by coloring the bottom of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
so we do that by coloring the bottom of
the<00:01:39.900> pieces<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.770> red<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> blue<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the pieces with red and blue to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.240 
the pieces with red and blue to
correspond<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> black<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> white<00:01:42.630> pieces

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
correspond to the black and white pieces

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
correspond to the black and white pieces
and<00:01:44.250> without<00:01:44.430> getting<00:01:44.759> into<00:01:44.880> too<00:01:45.060> much<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
and without getting into too much of the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.120 
and without getting into too much of the
gory<00:01:45.810> details<00:01:45.899> I'll<00:01:46.470> explain<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:46.979> bit

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
gory details I'll explain a little bit

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
gory details I'll explain a little bit
about<00:01:47.340> how<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.790> done<00:01:47.909> first<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.869> we

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
about how this is done first of all we

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.020 
about how this is done first of all we
store<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> calibration<00:01:50.100> image<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.700> what<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
store a calibration image of what the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.179 
store a calibration image of what the
board<00:01:51.450> looks<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.990> no<00:01:52.079> pieces<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
board looks like with no pieces on it so

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.440 
board looks like with no pieces on it so
you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> ceiling<00:01:54.149> looks<00:01:54.299> like

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you can see what the ceiling looks like

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
you can see what the ceiling looks like
if<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.720> any<00:01:54.840> patterns<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.590> their

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
if there any patterns on it all their

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
if there any patterns on it all their
things<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
things like that you can see this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
things like that you can see this
what<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.410> camera<00:01:58.980> actually<00:01:59.130> sees<00:01:59.490> from<00:01:59.730> under

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
what the camera actually sees from under

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
what the camera actually sees from under
the<00:01:59.970> board<00:02:00.150> we<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> mask<00:02:01.620> image<00:02:01.950> which

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the board we then use a mask image which

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
the board we then use a mask image which
you<00:02:02.220> can<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.370> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> top<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.660> tells

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you can see in the top right which tells

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
you can see in the top right which tells
the<00:02:04.020> software<00:02:04.380> exactly<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:04.890> bits<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.220> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the software exactly which bits of the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
the software exactly which bits of the
image<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> supposed<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.910> be<00:02:06.060> looking<00:02:06.150> at<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
image it's supposed to be looking at and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.450 
image it's supposed to be looking at and
where<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> chest<00:02:07.740> where's<00:02:07.950> while<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.280> board

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
where the chest where's while on board

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.249 
where the chest where's while on board
we<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.210> subtract<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> background<00:02:10.170> image

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
we then subtract the background image

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
we then subtract the background image
from<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> image<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.220> seeing<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.790> get

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
from the image that it's seeing to get

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.250 
from the image that it's seeing to get
rid<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.210> ceiling<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.780> any<00:02:12.870> other<00:02:13.020> things

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
rid of a ceiling and any other things

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.750 
rid of a ceiling and any other things
that<00:02:13.350> shows<00:02:13.590> us<00:02:13.800> exactly<00:02:13.980> where<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> pieces

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
that shows us exactly where the pieces

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.430 
that shows us exactly where the pieces
are<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.840> put<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
are as you can see down here put the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.200 
are as you can see down here put the
color<00:02:16.590> slightly<00:02:16.860> shifted<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
color slightly shifted this is the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.790 
color slightly shifted this is the
subtraction<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.350> all<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> do

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
subtraction and then all we have to do

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.990 
subtraction and then all we have to do
is<00:02:19.890> look<00:02:20.010> at<00:02:20.130> what<00:02:20.250> color<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> pieces<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is look at what color the pieces are and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.410 
is look at what color the pieces are and
we<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.210> tell<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:22.560> pieces<00:02:22.770> they<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:24.300> then

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
we can tell which pieces they up so then

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.520 
we can tell which pieces they up so then
we<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.870> able<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.080> move<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.350> pieces

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
we have to be able to move the pieces

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
we have to be able to move the pieces
around<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.980> board<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.340> play<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.520> game<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.760> chess

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
around the board to play a game of chess

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
around the board to play a game of chess
we<00:02:28.200> did<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.500> using<00:02:28.709> magnets<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.550> may

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
we did this using magnets as you may

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
we did this using magnets as you may
have<00:02:29.730> guessed<00:02:30.380> because<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.410> magnet<00:02:31.800> embedded

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
have guessed because a magnet embedded

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.890 
have guessed because a magnet embedded
in<00:02:32.250> each<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.580> chess<00:02:32.760> pieces<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:33.810> we

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
in each of the chess pieces and then we

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.180 
in each of the chess pieces and then we
have<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> magnet<00:02:34.350> mounted<00:02:34.620> under<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.830> board<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
have a magnet mounted under the board on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.530 
have a magnet mounted under the board on
the<00:02:35.280> end<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.580> arm<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.330> here

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the end of this arm you can see here

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.240 
the end of this arm you can see here
we'll<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:36.840> split<00:02:36.959> into<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.350> sections<00:02:37.590> and

magnet on a moving motor we didn't use

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.820 
magnet on a moving motor we didn't use
an<00:02:57.540> electromagnet<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.410> they're<00:02:58.590> heavier

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
an electromagnet because they're heavier

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.370 
an electromagnet because they're heavier
and<00:02:59.010> strong<00:02:59.489> which<00:03:00.209> means<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.870> can't<00:03:01.110> reverse

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380

the air when they get captured but
that's<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.890> sacrifice<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.430> had<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.640> make

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
that's just a sacrifice we had to make

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.770 
that's just a sacrifice we had to make
so<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> little<00:03:08.700> more<00:03:08.790> detail<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.480> how<00:03:09.720> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
pieces are moved around the board we

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.250 
pieces are moved around the board we
take<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> chess<00:03:11.910> move<00:03:12.090> which<00:03:12.330> consists<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.140> a

start and end square and source and
destination<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.290> break<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.560> down

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
destination we have to break that down

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.080 
destination we have to break that down
into<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:17.010> number<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> straight<00:03:17.549> lines<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
piece to move along that then gets

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
piece to move along that then gets
translated<00:03:20.700> into<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.450> angles<00:03:21.810> which<00:03:21.959> the
