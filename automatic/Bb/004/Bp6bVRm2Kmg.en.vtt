some baby brine shrimp in they eat quite

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
some baby brine shrimp in they eat quite
a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> they're<00:00:28.140> growing<00:00:28.439> pretty

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
a lot of it and they're growing pretty

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.370 
a lot of it and they're growing pretty
quickly<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> breeding<00:00:31.050> tank

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
quickly so this is the breeding tank

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
quickly so this is the breeding tank
that<00:00:31.529> there<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.189> look<00:00:32.369> from<00:00:32.520> above<00:00:32.899> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that there and we look from above you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.690 
that there and we look from above you
can<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.559> tend<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> hang

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
