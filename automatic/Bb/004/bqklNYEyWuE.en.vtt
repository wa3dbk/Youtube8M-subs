 the center of tokyo i am now in japan 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.330
 and I want to share with you my 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.770
 observations about the clothes worn 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.210
 Japanese and Japanese struck me first 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.949
 the fact that the Japanese and Japanese are very cool 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.779
 dress up dress up stylish dress up 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 Fashionable dress straight know 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 European healthy and beautiful when 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 traveled here from Moscow I expected to see 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.750
 some kind of asian style some kind of special 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.850
 may be traditional and even costumes and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.719
 well, or something less simple because 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 what really guys japan is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.430
 just something with something that's it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 a country in which everyone expresses himself 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.530
 how can and using clothes including 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.290
 here clothes one love taste and color 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.710
 sold bright youth classic 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.670
 sold different style elements 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 that is actually guys if yes 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.150
 for example here and so dress up local 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 schoolgirls see such skirts 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.850
 equally they still do not understand 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.130
 that's how you would see everything in the anime 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.729
 that you see some movies here all 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.369
 implemented in full and the most 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.700
 interesting for me was when you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.759
 you come but after you come in the subway 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.619
 can be seen as classic dressed 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.439
 for example with suits costumes by the way too 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.110
 very well chosen all sit in ram 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.030
 neatly that is 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.450
 but I can just say that the Japanese 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.820
 know a lot about style, I know a lot about fashion do not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.310
 afraid to experiment completely 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.620
 there is also a separate district here 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.290
 called well care which 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.930
 people are going to lovers 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.380
 wear different costumes for example costumes 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.009
 anime costume and from different cartoons 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.540
 films and they gather on Saturdays and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.900

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.500
 picked up the form of a musical instrument 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.270

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.870

 any quality brand level also here 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.720
 for example, you can dress like this 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.390
 made such Japanese flowers here 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.459

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.350
 schoolchildren dress up like this 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.940
 classroom account so that people are casual 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 dress here such dresses 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.150
 it's everyday 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:18.850
 yes it's not easy to carnival yes yes it is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.710
 quite ordinary daily clothes on 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.950
 work economy they dress more 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.050
 kept in blue-black such suits or 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.900
 sweaters 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.660
 but this type of cute clothes is quite 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.000
 can be met on permanently 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.490
 now i 'm standing just outside it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.820
 such give one of the central 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.640
 branches street and better probably become 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.070
 like this there will be more light and just 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.650
 look here know this typical 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.060
 clothes youth dress up in principle 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.400
 jeans beacons some kind of sneakers here 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.860
 for example, a girl in a bright hoody walks 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.990
 that is what I want to say let's here 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.070
 so here's the end of the video I will say that 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.130
 Japan can be found so bright 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.740
 dressed people are so unusual dressed 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.570
 people who walk like this every day 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.070
 not just some kind there again like 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.160
 Polissya carnival whether something special 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.709
 every day they dress unusually but 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.269
 and yes there are a lot 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.220
 stores with clothes from principle 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.930
 inexpensive it would seem that this is probably 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.440
 very expensive there is nothing like 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 don't sit down shops he basically 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.660
 not very expensive here are so cute 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.790
 all sorts of things are sold there for 500 by 600 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.850
 up to 700 rubles which is not expensive at all 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.800
 Yes, here are guys and especially young people 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.060
 worn very cool bright somehow cute 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.880
 I would even say such a cute style 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.150
 feminine is some kind of all I do not know 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.310
 very bright and of course they work 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.770
 so don't go when you start working 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.710
 in the company you dress more 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.690
 classic for example here for example 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.580
 schoolgirls see their form too 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.550
 skirts such 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.280
 but long and cool that they love 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.319
 worn on backpacks with loose straps 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.270
 on dad but for example another girls 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.900
 they also see forms with elongated 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.729
 skirts 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.300
 that is, if I give it now 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.979
 showed yes and in every school in 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.129
 everybody there is a school 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.479
 It will have its own style of clothes, in principle, but in 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.479
 form now the wall 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.400
 this wall very clearly reflects the Japanese 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.159
 style and he's bright a little bit crazy 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.889
 little year eclectic combination 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.409
 totally incompatible 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.210
 things and guys i want you this video 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.270
 inspire u especially if you are from Russia 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
 I want to inspire you 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.440
 so you are not afraid to experiment 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.389
 so you are not afraid to try 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.759
 wear some stuff because we 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.759
 even in Moscow here you go to the subway all 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.650
 some gray such dress more 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.620
 pastel colors are more than usual 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.409
 clothes can of course meet sometimes 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.900
 sometimes someone more interesting but usually 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.090
 people are afraid afraid to try afraid 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.330
 experimenting are afraid to wear something 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.289
 very bright and acid color 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.289
 can be any combination is not 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.930
 absolutely incredible colors in japan 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.569
 for example, the opposite is quite normal and here 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.409
 I do not know to buy such bright T-shirts 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.330
 colors 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:25.469
 or skirts very fashionable idea 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.419
 wear shoes and under them wear socks 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.949
 by the way us this trend started 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.900
 appear in Russia well, somehow not 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:34.870
 especially caught on because girls 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.000
 ours but shy to wear shoes 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.460
 wear them still enter socks you too 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.740
 girl goes can not you see here 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.960
 such shoes and under them dress sock I 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.759
 I just remembered trying this nonsense 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.310
 tendency to take root a couple of years ago but 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.560
 Exactly in Moscow in real life except 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.650
 as in the pictures I have not seen anyone who 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.589
 so that you wear it like this 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.839
 often again there is a girl in shoes 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.849
 and under these shoes are wearing white socks 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.690
 I think it looks very feminine 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.910
 and cute 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.380
