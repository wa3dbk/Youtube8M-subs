sail there's less windage when the sail
is<00:01:04.619> full<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.790> easier<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.390> back

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
is full and it's much easier to get back

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
is full and it's much easier to get back
down<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.840> deck<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.950> sort<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
down on deck so that's sort of the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
down on deck so that's sort of the
appeal<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> cruisers<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:10.260> offshore

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
appeal for the cruisers for offshore

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.190 
appeal for the cruisers for offshore
sailing<00:01:11.540> short-handed<00:01:12.540> offshore<00:01:12.930> sailing

again<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.490> easier<00:01:14.939> system<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.840> hook<00:01:16.020> up

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
again it's much easier system to hook up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.980 
again it's much easier system to hook up

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.820 
go with a softer head patch and some
webbing<00:03:30.690> at<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> top<00:03:31.110> here<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.440> opposed<00:03:31.739> to

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
webbing at the top here as opposed to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.080 
webbing at the top here as opposed to
the<00:03:31.920> ring<00:03:32.220> which<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.550> think<00:03:32.730> would<00:03:32.820> help<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the ring which I think would help it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.970 
the ring which I think would help it
work<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.360> little<00:03:33.480> better<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.709> works<00:03:34.860> pretty

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
work a little better but it works pretty

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.640 
work a little better but it works pretty
nicely<00:03:35.130> as<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.850> then<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.870> beauty<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.530> this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
nicely as it is then the beauty of this

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.190 
nicely as it is then the beauty of this
Marlow<00:03:38.310> pro-drive<00:03:38.790> Georgian<00:03:39.420> rope<00:03:39.569> is<00:03:39.870> that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
Marlow pro-drive Georgian rope is that

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.770 
Marlow pro-drive Georgian rope is that
instead<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.560> having<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:41.030> splice<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.630> can

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
instead of having to splice it we can

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.360 
instead of having to splice it we can
just<00:03:42.810> stitch<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.350> with<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> sewing<00:03:43.769> machine

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
just stitch it with a sewing machine

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.520 
just stitch it with a sewing machine
which<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:44.700> nice<00:03:44.940> we've<00:03:45.569> left<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.959> uncovered

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
which is nice we've left it uncovered

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.100 
which is nice we've left it uncovered
for<00:03:46.920> purposes<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.910> photo<00:03:48.540> shoot<00:03:48.840> but

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
for purposes of this photo shoot but

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.350 
for purposes of this photo shoot but
they<00:03:49.620> probably<00:03:49.830> will<00:03:50.250> cover<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.790> with<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.000> clear

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
they probably will cover it with a clear

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.030 
they probably will cover it with a clear
shrink<00:03:51.780> wrap<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.230> we<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.560> monitor<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
shrink wrap so we can monitor the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.590 
shrink wrap so we can monitor the
stitching<00:03:53.580> over<00:03:53.730> time<00:03:54.060> just<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.420> make<00:03:54.569> sure

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
stitching over time just to make sure

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.540 
stitching over time just to make sure
it's<00:03:54.840> holding<00:03:55.140> up<00:03:55.230> nicely<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:56.280> give<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.489> a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
it's holding up nicely and to give it a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:14.630 
it's holding up nicely and to give it a
better<00:03:56.730> finished<00:03:57.120> look

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.100 

here<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:15.730> demonstrate<00:04:16.180> how<00:04:16.209> easy<00:04:16.360> it<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.870> to

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
here we demonstrate how easy it is to

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.870 
here we demonstrate how easy it is to
get<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.320> furled<00:04:17.650> sail<00:04:17.890> on<00:04:18.070> deck<00:04:18.340> compared<00:04:18.760> to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
get the furled sail on deck compared to

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.400 
get the furled sail on deck compared to
a<00:04:18.910> conventional<00:04:19.450> snuper<00:04:19.810> sock

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
a conventional snuper sock

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.010 
a conventional snuper sock
we'll<00:04:21.130> then<00:04:21.160> switch<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.640> an<00:04:21.880> unmodified<00:04:22.270> a3

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
we'll then switch to an unmodified a3

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.290 
we'll then switch to an unmodified a3
Reacher<00:04:23.350> which<00:04:24.100> has<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.310> very<00:04:24.610> similar<00:04:24.910> shape

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
Reacher which has a very similar shape

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.910 
Reacher which has a very similar shape
to<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.810> typical<00:04:25.930> cruising<00:04:26.530> spinnaker

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
to that of a typical cruising spinnaker

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.190 
to that of a typical cruising spinnaker
then<00:04:27.670> we'll<00:04:27.850> demonstrate<00:04:28.000> how<00:04:28.450> easy<00:04:28.480> it<00:04:28.870> is<00:04:28.930> to

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
then we'll demonstrate how easy it is to

00:04:29.200 --> 00:05:26.260 
then we'll demonstrate how easy it is to
use<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.500> system

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.420
