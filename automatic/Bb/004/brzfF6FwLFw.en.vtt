00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.610
 there was once a chick that was very 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:15.650
 little boy and they said cute little chick there 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.650
 you hear that there are people outside the street 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.610
 the recorded laughter we are all from the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.670
 strength does not happen to them when it's cold 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.580
 is fond of a sweatshirt or a 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.619
 yes, very warm with the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.489
 Peluchito and everything and when they send it to 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.890
 wash and there's the panic plane like that 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.370
 let me see very often with this 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.860
 chamarrita because it's nice 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.629
 I'm very happy with her I'm happier 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.629
 because today I'm going to propose a 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.409
 treatment to make up that hair 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.420
 I added ximo by dye iron dryer 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.909
 curls everything we do in the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.820
 hair but also to prepare that 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.559
 hair for party hairstyles 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.440
 and it really is such a treatment 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.380
 so good that if they do it once to the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.210
 week embrace for example if the 24th of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.430
 December are going to be fixed then from 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.890
 on the 20th do at least one or two 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.990
 Sometimes the hair is not going to mistreat the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.770
 We will divide it into several treatments 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.770
 parts 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.990
 Let's start with the first Here 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.780
 I recommend that to be very very well 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.570
 Let's have their tools that is 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 the same is what is used and bought 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.679
 to put the dye on the hair and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.750
 all this and this I bought it in salt and 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.640
 where all the tools come for 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.590

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.270
 treatments you can find everything 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.729

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.880
 how are we going to go with your brushes 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.189
 protein and of things so good for 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.039
 our hair we are going to start our 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.039
 treatment with a teaspoon of 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.590
 is the first ingredient that we are going to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.090
 use this treatment we are going to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.130

 has the jojoba oil for the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.370
 hair for the nails and not least the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.550
 castor oil we have already used it in 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.290
 other recipes because it regenerates and stimulates 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.220
 the growth of more than the thickness and 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.430
 wonderful vitamin treatment 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.939

 remove call me half and half in that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.719
 it or it cost me so much to do it true and 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.180
 let's start applying the the 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.389
 treatment in an appropriate manner and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.329
 effective so that it penetrates until the last 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:15.280
 layer of our hair all the fibers 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.709
 of our hair that regenerates it 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.129
 red washcloth because the theme is life 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.250
 of mail see it 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.669
 by keith and I'm going to divide my hair into 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.609
 two one part for each and another part 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.549
 for and this one I'm going to divide 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.769
 then I will start here 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.280
 I have all my mix I'm going to take my 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.709
 brochita and now yes very carefully and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.810
 patience I will start from the root 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.629
 people who have hair 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.240
 fatty example do it from means to 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.940
 tips 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.510
 eliminate olive oil or oil 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.690
 of visible handling with oil in the 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.910
 tips and we go with the second part of 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.060
 hair very careful with the part 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.450
 outside of the hair this part where 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.700
 It is generally more exposed to the sun 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.070
 the pollution we iron 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.740
 very much there are much less 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.990
 protected that the internal part so 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.330
 maybe like I suddenly have this 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:21.739
 healthier and this more damage much emphasis 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:26.530
 in those tips in that fringe and in 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.530
 all the hair and so you're going to be everything 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.810
 I know everyone as you drive 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.030
 removing those exits next year is going to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.030
 have very private hair 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.350
 because there are friends we are back with 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.890
 the second part of the treatment 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.170
 wonderful 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.360
 for this you're going to need a beer and 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.550
 let's start to celebrate and so we are 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.550
 will forget the burned hair 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.000
 friends sauce the protein of the beer 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:13.930
 which is so important to have 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 strength and the sugar of beer like 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.250
 that closes the cuticle and adds us 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.889
 shine to the hair that's why it's so good 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.250
 the beer we're going to put half a glass 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:27.819
 of beer and the rest of the glass we're going 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:31.210
 to apply hot water that I have you give me 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.090
 or beer half cut the beer and 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.009
 half hot water now I am 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.199
 doing in a glass cup so that 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.629
 you can see it really is better 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.969
 do it in a mustard atomizer 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:45.380
 yellow is not only delicious in 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.140
 the sandwiches on the tables now 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.310
 we are not going to eat them we are going to 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.560
 use in our hair because it is 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.400
 stimulating and this what will we do 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.690
 is that it will definitely help us 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.270
 let our mind grow 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:10.520
 what is this these will be our masters 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.100
 with this we are going to wash our hair and 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.580
 you can use the conditioner that you 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.800
 you want and now here I have the beer and 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.800
 I'm going to start applying the area 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.790
 distribute it like it was shampoo in 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.760
 all my hair not a massage with the yolk 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.200
 of the fingers on the scalp to 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.849
 stimulate that growth with mustard 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.339
 a little table but 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.319
 although they are left submerged like this and 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.360
 remember that they are going to use an atomizer 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:43.189
 because it is much more advisable to use 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.589
 glass can break can be hurt 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.539
 another thing that I want to tell you that 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.639
 they can do it in the shower as they 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.520
 I said like a shampoo or outside the 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.619
 shower and they leave it for another 10 minutes 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.749
 to act and then remove everything and 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.839
 it gets in your conditioner it is no longer 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:02.419
 necessary to put shampoo and so they are going to 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:04.189
 stay around another 10 minutes 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:08.439
 to act the first treatment has 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:08.439
 put and they will remove the hip 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:19.279
 and now I'm going to use my conditioner 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.939
 I'm not going to deny anything of means to 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:21.939
 just 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.380
 so I wished 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.409
 m 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.190
 louis and I want to tell you that sometimes 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.259
 treatments when they are so strong 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.180
 you have to do them on a day that does not 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.280
 let's leave we have nothing because 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.750
 Sometimes you tend to see a little bit of 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.500
 fatty with all the protein and pump 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.479
 Fatty and everything that we are 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.060
 adding the hair that you no longer have and 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:53.400
 that's exactly what we want that 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.830
 have a very happy merry christmas 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.250
