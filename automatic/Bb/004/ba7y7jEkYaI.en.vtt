00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 as we are in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.980
 point day let's see a mod 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.550
 this July 7 and is that it adds boots boots 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 boots to minecraft take and take and take and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.070
 now the one who gave me only genzyme 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.350
 he and I alone with the sheep take that away 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.020
 outside the question is that it is beyond 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.689
 of boots many boots are not the first 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.810
 what we can do to do, I say to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 do so normal I have the boots 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.309
 these techniques of the had I had 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.559
 all this updated we have the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 regular bots these are made with 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.950
 four leather and two wool but this one 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 we can not put it on this one 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 do others every we will see then we have 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.219
 that of emerald and obsidian bones that 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 let's get like this to see the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.620
 armor that gives us the bone we get 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.620
 one dot armor chulas 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.600
 those of emerald that give us one and a half 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.930
 and the obsidian ones that give us two that 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.110
 the character is very simple is those of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.560
 bones are four emerald bones 43 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 glances 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.979
 Over there 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.660
 I do not leave now those who stayed 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.930
 the little corner in games like call of 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.620
 duty and you can kill you're one you're 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.620
 a cheat 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.680
 I did not expect it and how do they say no 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 comes out male 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.740
 those who know what I mean there 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.010
 The campers said they were not the campers 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.480
 that you have a camper but good in him already 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.450
 I do not know where the emeralds went to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.750
 54 emeralds and followed with 42 and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.750
 Diana 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.150
 it was not well hidden the uncle in short 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.440
 but now the question is that adds 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.660
 other boots that are more 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.530
 interesting and we need to make a 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.130
 portal to the dimension of the boots of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.130
 glass with stone 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.720
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.330
 It happens to me 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 Thank you 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.950
 so and so we organize this mb 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.990
 dimension that is done with four 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.420
 diamonds but good we have the super 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.550
 dimension and let's go for the boots is a 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.170
 Boots dimension 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.170
 we are here this already adds to how it 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.900
 says this the grass of this weird of this 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.810
 dimension 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 normal earth and stone but well that's not 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.209
 is what interests us what we 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.750
 interesting is finding boots 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.730
 here we have emerald boots in are 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.349
 moix simply what I do not know if they are 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.569
 aggressive aggressive ultraprecision you 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.950
 who attack the bots 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.379
 there are no invisible boots 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.060
 that attack me shoes worth resort 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.440
 creative vale had not seen the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.019
 invisible 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.959
 this is interesting also because 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.269
 example can salt can take us out the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.500
 object with which they are made then 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.530
 the interesting thing here is those of 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.370
 invisibility for example you see that we 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.940
 loose this invisible fragment would be 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.739
 others had not seen those of 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.230
 invisibility of normally with the 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.230
 name has killed him I'm not sure 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.900
 I have only been released one must kill 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.900
 many are the speed boots 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.849
 and they could release less loose now 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.069
 plus those of bone that are not loose 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.099
 bone just believe me I do not feel 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.190
 nothing the speed those poop poop 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.959
 cow goes the most that can usually 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.750
 it be enough stress 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.760
 this fragment is the speed and we 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.900
 one thing is missing 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.379
 we need one if we still need to find them and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.120
 here are the jump boots take and 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.680
 give me a porfa fragment 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.409
 do not 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.609
 did not send any one how sad I am for the 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.220
 of loose jumps this here that 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.709
 jump fragment simply and with 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.160
 these fragments we can make boots or 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.830
 to take everything away from these 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.850
 boots here for example the jump 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.630
 is done with the boots these we have 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.120
 made with 4 of 4 and 2 wool and surrounded 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.810
 of jump fragments and let's try 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.180
 the jump banners 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.940
 they go around gives us the baby that I do not know what it is 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.460
 jump three bath 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.200
 what interests me here is to know why 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.380
 that's where it says is this same side 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.740
 this world 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.440
 we'll see 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.539
 kaka I do not hate is that there are many more than 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.300
 they add get jump like this but if 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.940
 songs of a lot of height is for you 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.729
 the ankles and that's a poop then the 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.770
 of speed that is done with the boots 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.639
 normal and all surrounded by fragments of 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.420
 speed can speed us 3 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.180
 which is cool too 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.970
 mola more my mother yes cool and those of 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.700
 invisibility of people who go out with the 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.410
 boots and fragments of invisibility in 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.590
 the invisibility 3 I do not know what 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.200
 difference has invisibility 3 puts the 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.660
 1 that and less detectable 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.030
 maybe an invisibility stamp never what 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.130
 used we never used it and then we have 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.320
 jota that is said to be jump and 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.449
 speed that is putting together the two boots 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.129
 simply with 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.129
 and this same thing I call the mass 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.800
 this can blow the problem much more 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.620
 is that if you fall too high 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.840
 When growing tall, it's not the 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.240
 normal jumps less bad it's okay 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.470
 calculated but I guess from a 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.470
 more block and we will hurt 

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:06.709
 it does not matter I'm super fast you can not 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:07.780
 with me from a block more I do not do 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:10.920
 hurt 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.920
 and from 2 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.010
 also sometimes that they vote do 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.010
 hurt 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.710
 but it's not bad eh I thought it would be 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.060
 that would be much tighter is not 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.260
 pretty cool to 30 and not long ago 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.000
 hurt 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.460
 from three blocks it may be that already 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.050
 start hurting 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.050
 73 height blocks 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.770
 but hey this is the sea â€‹â€‹as you see a 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:41.319
 curious 7 this one of the boots to me the 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.060
 design I like best are those on 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.849
 This is there and see if they are the most 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.229
 faces of the mamola a lot the design I do not know 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.919
 why but good you have the one that 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:55.560
 description is for 1.7 point 10 and 1 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:55.560
 point 7.2 yes is the comfort gtc 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.870
 bye
