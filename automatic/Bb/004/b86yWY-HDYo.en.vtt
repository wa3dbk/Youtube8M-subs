seconds yes he's got it in he's got it
in<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> second<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.050> spare<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.650> tell<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
in with a second to spare I tell you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.759 
in with a second to spare I tell you
what<00:00:29.849> he<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.260> get<00:00:31.349> rubbed<00:00:31.590> out

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
what he was about to get rubbed out

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.979 
what he was about to get rubbed out
their<00:00:32.009> clock<00:00:32.340> they've<00:00:32.759> they're<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
their clock they've they're going for it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.729 
their clock they've they're going for it
and<00:00:35.180> I<00:00:36.180> think<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.500> close

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and I think it's going to be very close

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
and I think it's going to be very close
actually<00:00:38.239> let's<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> look

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.009 

that's<00:00:44.100> okay<00:00:44.519> it's<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.969> where<00:00:45.329> did<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.719> land

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
that's okay it's just where did it land

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.509 
that's okay it's just where did it land
and<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.350> sure<00:00:46.559> coping<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.070> rest<00:00:47.250> appeal

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
and I'm sure coping the rest appeal

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.650 
and I'm sure coping the rest appeal
because<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> might<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> been<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because it might have been going on to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
because it might have been going on to
hit

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.100 

outside<00:00:54.250> leg<00:00:54.460> for<00:00:54.640> me<00:00:54.670> well<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.570> don't<00:00:55.690> think<00:00:56.020> it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
outside leg for me well I don't think it

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.740 
outside leg for me well I don't think it
fits<00:00:56.200> outside<00:00:56.590> leg<00:00:56.830> I<00:00:57.310> think<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:58.239> think<00:00:58.450> it<00:00:58.540> held

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
fits outside leg I think I think it held

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.140 
fits outside leg I think I think it held
up<00:00:58.930> but<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.739> maybe<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.370> hide<00:01:00.580> hit<00:01:00.880> him<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.090> the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
up but it maybe to hide hit him on the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.840 
up but it maybe to hide hit him on the
roll<00:01:01.620> let's<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:02.830> a<00:01:02.860> look<00:01:03.100> there<00:01:03.309> we<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.460> see

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
roll let's have a look there we I see

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.340 
roll let's have a look there we I see
it's<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.059> pitching<00:01:04.239> middle<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.839> straightening

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
it's a pitching middle and straightening

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.730 
it's a pitching middle and straightening
down<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.650> line<00:01:05.830> look<00:01:06.190> I<00:01:06.310> got<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:07.000> say<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.710> said<00:01:08.710> I

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
down the line look I got to say I said I

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.830 
down the line look I got to say I said I
thought<00:01:09.010> this<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.280> very<00:01:09.460> close<00:01:09.760> and<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.240> think

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
thought this is very close and I think

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.500 
thought this is very close and I think
it<00:01:11.010> now<00:01:12.010> look<00:01:12.220> it<00:01:12.369> more<00:01:12.760> than<00:01:12.910> half<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.300> ball

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
it now look it more than half the ball

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.880 
it now look it more than half the ball
has<00:01:14.050> got<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.350> be<00:01:14.650> below<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.460> top<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> bales

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
has got to be below the top of the bales

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460 
has got to be below the top of the bales
so<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.580> is<00:01:18.700> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.540> issue<00:01:19.780> here

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
so this is going to be the issue here

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.430 
so this is going to be the issue here
there<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:20.920> pitching<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.580> middle<00:01:21.940> oh<00:01:22.140> boy

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
there it is pitching on middle oh boy

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.260 
there it is pitching on middle oh boy
I'm<00:01:24.070> afraid<00:01:24.399> to<00:01:24.640> say<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.180> all<00:01:25.390> over<00:01:25.750> oh<00:01:27.270> yes

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
I'm afraid to say it's all over oh yes

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.410 
I'm afraid to say it's all over oh yes
good<00:01:28.330> appeal<00:01:28.869> it<00:01:29.380> took<00:01:29.530> their<00:01:29.710> time<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:31.000> this

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
good appeal it took their time but this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.889 
good appeal it took their time but this
is<00:01:31.600> just<00:01:31.990> about<00:01:32.310> 5050<00:01:33.310> or<00:01:33.340> maybe<00:01:33.759> not<00:01:34.000> maybe

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
is just about 5050 or maybe not maybe

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.430 
is just about 5050 or maybe not maybe
it's<00:01:35.290> 52<00:01:35.890> 48<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.550> balls<00:01:36.729> outside<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.990> middle

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
it's 52 48 the balls outside the middle

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's 52 48 the balls outside the middle
of<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.070> stump<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.970> could<00:01:40.240> still<00:01:40.509> be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
of the stump so it could still be

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.639 
of the stump so it could still be
umpires<00:01:41.140> call<00:01:42.030> yes<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.630> leaned<00:01:43.840> ours<00:01:44.110> got

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
umpires call yes it is I leaned ours got

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.889 
umpires call yes it is I leaned ours got
this<00:01:44.830> one<00:01:45.039> right<00:01:45.280> by<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.940> think<00:01:46.270> about<00:01:46.690> two

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
this one right by I think about two

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.240 
this one right by I think about two
percenters<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> middle<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.070> ball

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
percenters of the middle of the ball

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.460 
percenters of the middle of the ball
it's<00:01:48.610> ridiculous<00:01:49.210> just<00:01:49.479> outside<00:01:49.899> that<00:01:50.140> can't

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it's ridiculous just outside that can't

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.250 
it's ridiculous just outside that can't
be<00:01:50.619> my<00:01:50.860> score<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.960> not<00:01:53.259> unbiased<00:01:53.649> call

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
be my score that's not unbiased call

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.320 
be my score that's not unbiased call
I<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.070> where<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.700> Empire<00:01:57.030> score

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
I want to know where the Empire score

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.180 
I want to know where the Empire score
comes<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:59.240> think<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.870> was<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
comes in I think that that was the the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.640 
comes in I think that that was the the
instruction<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:03.060> upstairs<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.350> trying

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
instruction from upstairs but I'm trying

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.649 
instruction from upstairs but I'm trying
to<00:02:04.740> work<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.700> umpires<00:02:06.090> call<00:02:06.330> comes

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to work out where the umpires call comes

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
to work out where the umpires call comes
in<00:02:06.869> come<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> explore<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> only

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
in come on you explore the only

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.440 
in come on you explore the only
suggestion<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.490> have<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.060> take<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.240> look<00:02:09.300> at

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
suggestion I have you take a look at

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.059 
suggestion I have you take a look at
that<00:02:09.509> again<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.140> zoom<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that again and zoom on it

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.720 
that again and zoom on it
the<00:02:11.610> Hawkeye<00:02:11.940> suggests<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.730> biggest

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the Hawkeye suggests that biggest

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.330 
the Hawkeye suggests that biggest
section<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> ball<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.840> outside<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
section of the ball was outside the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.550 
section of the ball was outside the
stump<00:02:17.670> when<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.660> take<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.350> from

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
stump when we take a look at from

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.920 
stump when we take a look at from
another<00:02:20.040> angle<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.209> what<00:02:21.480> I'm<00:02:21.600> talking

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
another angle this is what I'm talking

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.580 
another angle this is what I'm talking
about<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.850> shows<00:02:24.209> when<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.660> zoom<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
about it shows when you zoom in that

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.790 
about it shows when you zoom in that
there's<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.940> percentage<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
there's just a percentage of to that the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.440 
there's just a percentage of to that the
center<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> seam<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.580> outside<00:02:30.000> legs<00:02:30.239> done

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
center of the seam is outside legs done

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.830 
center of the seam is outside legs done
off<00:02:30.780> stump<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.320> case<00:02:32.269> well<00:02:33.269> I'm<00:02:33.630> going<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
off stump in that case well I'm going to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
off stump in that case well I'm going to
say<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.380> thought<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.220> applied<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
say to you I thought it applied to the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.870 
say to you I thought it applied to the
outside<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> stump<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.459> take<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
outside of the stump and if you take the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.210 
outside of the stump and if you take the
outside<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.690> stump<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.709> look<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
outside of the stump you look at the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.610 
outside of the stump you look at the
outside<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.000> stump<00:02:42.360> there's<00:02:43.019> more<00:02:43.410> than

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
outside of the stump there's more than

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
outside of the stump there's more than
half<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:44.070> ball<00:02:44.810> if<00:02:45.810> you're<00:02:45.989> taking<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
half the ball if you're taking the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.320 
half the ball if you're taking the
middle<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.310> stump<00:02:47.610> then<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.060> say

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
middle of the stump then it's say

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
middle of the stump then it's say
exactly<00:02:48.570> half<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.800> ball<00:02:50.010> that's<00:02:50.459> without

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
exactly half of the ball that's without

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.090 
exactly half of the ball that's without
it's<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.420> less<00:02:51.660> than<00:02:51.870> half<00:02:52.080> according<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
it's just less than half according to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.250 
it's just less than half according to
this<00:02:53.280> picture<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.720> course<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.140> it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
this picture but of course if it's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.930 
this picture but of course if it's
outside<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.860> stump<00:02:56.100> things<00:02:56.280> well<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:56.700> but

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
outside of the stump things well out but

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.600 
outside of the stump things well out but
if<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.420> only<00:02:57.450> line<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.200> them<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.530> I

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
if it's the only line I see them and I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.300 
if it's the only line I see them and I
think<00:02:59.610> they're<00:02:59.730> giving<00:02:59.850> too<00:03:00.239> much<00:03:01.040> too<00:03:02.040> much

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
think they're giving too much too much

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.729 
think they're giving too much too much
to<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.360> umpire<00:03:03.750> at<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.900> moment<00:03:04.170> see<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.440> for

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
to the umpire at the moment see that for

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.580 
to the umpire at the moment see that for
me<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.420> took<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.750> outside<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
me is if you took the outside of the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.500 
me is if you took the outside of the
stump<00:03:07.920> now<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.280> said<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.850> outside<00:03:09.360> of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
stump now if you said to the outside of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.930 
stump now if you said to the outside of
the<00:03:09.600> stump<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.829> line<00:03:11.070> then<00:03:11.400> I'd<00:03:11.519> accept

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the stump was the line then I'd accept

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.449 
the stump was the line then I'd accept
it<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.110> more<00:03:13.739> than<00:03:13.769> half<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> ball

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
it and that more than half of the ball

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.009 
it and that more than half of the ball
had<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.820> from<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> outside<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.810> stump

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
had to be from the outside of the stump

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.509 
had to be from the outside of the stump
that'll<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.290> fine<00:03:16.530> by<00:03:16.739> me<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.160> mean<00:03:17.340> that's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
that'll be fine by me but I mean that's

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.190 
that'll be fine by me but I mean that's
hitting<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> middle<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.360> leg<00:03:18.540> stump<00:03:18.870> there's

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
hitting the middle of leg stump there's

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.620 
hitting the middle of leg stump there's
no<00:03:19.320> doubt<00:03:19.620> about<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.340> mean<00:03:20.519> part<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.030> off

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
no doubt about that I mean part of off

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.479 
no doubt about that I mean part of off
stump<00:03:21.870> part<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.620> ball<00:03:22.829> is<00:03:22.980> actually<00:03:23.310> in

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
stump part of the ball is actually in

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.210 
stump part of the ball is actually in
the<00:03:23.549> middle

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
the middle

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.460 
the middle
maybe<00:03:26.120> not<00:03:26.390> but<00:03:26.690> we're<00:03:26.840> certainly<00:03:27.110> eating<00:03:27.350> off

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
maybe not but we're certainly eating off

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.800 
maybe not but we're certainly eating off
stump<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.970> current<00:03:29.420> rules<00:03:29.660> will

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
stump and the current rules will

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.230 
stump and the current rules will
indicate<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.290> he<00:03:30.980> was<00:03:31.010> not<00:03:31.250> out<00:03:31.430> bar<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:31.970> a

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
indicate that he was not out bar just a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.750 
indicate that he was not out bar just a
whisker
