00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.600

 agreement first of all we have the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.640
 pixies of horn go according to 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 god come out in the in the second movie 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 if I'm not wrong when the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 professor this one who editor or I do not know what 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 Corno contentillo drop it there there 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 in the defense class against the arts 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 dark and brown breath and it's 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 terrific be great then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.440
 on the other side we have the three here 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.390
 giants that are rum and fred and george's 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.390
 according to his brothers it's great there 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.550
 and then on the other hand we have dovi the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 hero the house elf that at the beginning 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's from lucius I think and well that helps 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 harry potter in the second movie and it's 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.440
 good in later because it also comes out 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 then on the other hand he hunts them pigs 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.330
 the club is coming to us, what are the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.430
 short pigs the pigs are the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.840
 Centaurs of the forbidden forest guys or 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 be as you are listening to it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.479
 All my hair is going, five centaurs 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.830
 of the forbidden forest 23 magicians among the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.960
 that are in our good 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.240
 protagonist of the saga harry potter 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 it would also be good if you want 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 the death eaters the magicians that you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 you want there are 23 magicians and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.080
 Also good is sirius black 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.790
 in short and then a dragon that dragons and 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.650
 in harrypotter our psyche 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.690
 dragons and what dragon is this dragon 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.850
 is from the fourth movie in the tests 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.560
 in the cup of fire the first test 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.970
 I think it's against a dragon so 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.759
 this is the dragon of the first movie 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.679
 then here we have three or deserved 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.790
 that they did not know exactly why he has 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 I got it stuck 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.409
 also a little but we can say that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.269
 the malfoy draco we can also say no 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.799
 I know how stuffed people do not 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.159
 also get into the movie right now 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.530
 good draco malfoy that today could be 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.359
 yes perfect and then here one of my 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.220
 characters that I love about harry 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.019
 potter agree in case you have not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.269
 realized I'm a big fan of 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.939

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.250

 I should be the Lord's girlfriend 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.010
 potter as his son is called because I 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.370

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.889
 she is mine 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.450
 I guess if you've seen Harry 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.799

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.840

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.079
 spells that good if you want then 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.190

 a purple one after neither wait for the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.710
 beautiful of the moment is worth the village 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.270
 we also have to keep in mind that 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.460
 it's clash of class and I have to look for a 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.560

 successes that could be but I tell you 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.300

 to see if I can do it to a 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.419
 City Hall that is much older than me 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.699
 I wish I could make more stars 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.400
 because it would be sincerely 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.889
 It would be amazing to make it three stars 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.099
 with terrestrial troops in the role of Harry 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.440
 potter to a much older town hall 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.419
 that my boys let's see her we do 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.819
 one already to begin we are winning there the 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.199
 witch hermione hermione you know what 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.539
 do in these cases is harry 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.370
 accompanied by neville is also by 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.930
 Here we can say that the 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.310
 skeletons that would not know what name 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.630
 put it right now can be the 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.490
 creatures is that we remember how it 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.250
 call me moon but where is it 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.110
 moon to monday is still there with us 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.210
 perfect apart are the creatures these 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.069
 that the moon sees with the glasses that are in 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.169
 harry when he's on the train and I do not know what 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.599
 so I think we're going to get 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.030
 a hundred per has a village of 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.560
 town hall level 81 one hundred percent not 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.940
 but because that is because I do not have time 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.780
 but I really would have given 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.330
 time that is because he has eliminated 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.830
 practically all the defenses but not 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.539
 it gives me time to destroy all this be 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.280
 I was rushed I was going to tell me 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.110
 precipitate you know 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.030
 I've been very much rash at the time of 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.620
 throw the troops not thought of in this area 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.500
 down here but I think the role of
