00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello, this is Mariana and today I 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.859
 I bring a review opinion about the book 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 I read in the noise ton I'm talking 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.670
 it takes with it ends it looks and carlos and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.679
 I do not want to talk to you about this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 book because what happened to me was that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.390
 when I read it I did not know absolutely 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 nothing and that made me surprise the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.269
 time to read and made me want this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.310
 book and it would not have happened if I had 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.309
 known that I was going what I can 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.040
 to say is that they are the characters 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.480
 main is Aryan and is Aryan pilgrim 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 live in the area that everything is very unreal 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.520
 they live in a fantasy everything is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 visual for them while pilgrim 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.059
 lives in areas prohibited for area 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.850
 and so he would live in forbidden areas 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.579
 for pilgrims what the book tells you 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 is that someone can not be where he is 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.920
 pilgrim because she could die 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.830
 just breathe the same air with 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.670
 some storms or something like that happens 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.450
 of ether and they could also talk to 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.700
 the cannibals and kill her the savages 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.890
 it's another dystopia and this world works 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.039
 in a virtual way which I think of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.619
 some very good way and as I told you 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.770
 outside, the savages live 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.799
 it is forbidden to go out of reverie 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.759
 aria is a normal girl has a better 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.420
 friend and they constantly fight with their 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.369
 Aryan mom is not the typical teenager 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.590
 Silly protagonist adapt very 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.079
 easily and at the end of the book is a 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.750
 person totally different from the aria 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.869
 that we saw at the beginning perry to do 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.979
 a savage is not bad you could say 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.060
 would do but not as soon as I finish perry 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.849
 he just feels fear he feels hate 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.810
 repulsion and perry feels the same for 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.959
 area he 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 he's a rude with her I love it because 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.520
 not be treated as princess or 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.040
 we have more characters but they are not so 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.579
 important as the pilgrim 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.579
 A.M 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.870
 something happens that makes perry have to 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.110
 ally with area 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.129
 because the two have in common the same 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.830
 objective that is daydreaming so that 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.209
 that laugh perry daydreaming true then no 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.970
 I'm going to tell you why you have to read 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.940
 the book but what I love is that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.650
 what you think might happen no 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.750
 it happens you completely change all the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.750
 circumstances changes everything 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.870
 you stay a bit in shock because 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.549
 many times when I read books happens to me 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.939
 I feel what is going to happen 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.879
 after or when it will end or I do not know 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:08.480
 what but not this is completely 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:11.330
 different at no time I felt 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.780
 that the book was predictable in no 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.780
 moment 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.500
 I loved it or we just see what 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.400
 What I have to tell you is that this 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.650
 book 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 It's great I loved it and they have to read it 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.070
 I saw that the second part that came down 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 eternal night is already in the bookstores 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.870
 for people to buy it 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.550
 who already read the first book and those who 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.680
 do not go for the two books or for 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.560
 the first one I do not know because seriously 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.060
 Seriously serious you will not regret 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.610
 great is 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.540
 I love 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:49.390
 and by government are 10 555 tweets 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:52.280
 aside the cover is great has me 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.550
 She loves the color blue so 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.990
 I do not know but I love it and I do not know what else 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.590
 say the tests give you that book 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.020
 carrier 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.940
 this has been all I hope to create a 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.650
 opportunity of this book and leave me nava 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.130
 with your comments if you already read the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.680
 book and they liked it if they did not like it and what 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.810
 they wait for the second part, not that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.480
 because it could contain true spoiler not 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.970
 it's good good good, it does not matter 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.590
 to see them but see them later 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.590
 another video costs a lot bye
