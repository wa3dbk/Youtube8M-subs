00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.165
 I have a number written here 

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.277
 Two, three, five 

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:07.124
 We now have experience in dealing with such numbers 

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:09.212
 We can understand "what these numbers represent" 

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.644
 To know this, all we have to do is look at the places of the cells 

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:15.962
 The number at the far right represents the single digits 

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:19.988
 If the number five represents 5 individuals 

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:26.502
 The three here are the scores if we have three dozen 

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.205
 That is, it represents the number thirty 

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.934
 The two here represent the square of hundreds 

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.467
 If this means that we have two hundred 

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.765
 Thus, these numbers represent two hundred and thirty-five or 235 

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:46.470
 Or we can say it represents 200 plus 30 plus 5 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.775
 What I want to do in this video is to help you think about the values ​​of the cells 

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.411
 To the right of the individual box 

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.750
 For one moment, you probably always think that the box is single 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.673
 Is the field that occupies the far right 

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.200
 Well, all we've done so far 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.763
 It was meant to prove that you could go beyond the single digits to the right 

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:06.321
 I'll put a small point here 

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.144
 We call it the decimal point 

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:11.681
 This interval means that anything is on her right 

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:15.562
 They belong to a smaller box than the one 

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.378
 We can say that to the left of the decimal point we have the square of the individual 

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.338
 And dozens and hundreds were betrayed 

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.206
 If we continue, we'll get to the thousands 

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:27.186
 And then the tens of thousands box but if we moved to the right of the decimal point 

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.568
 The numbers will be divided by 10, what does this mean? 

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:33.365
 Well, to the right of the decimal point 

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:36.276
 (We need a new color here) 

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:41.114
 We will find ourselves in the box of tens of thousands 

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:42.778
 What are the tens of thousands? 

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:44.372
 The number we write here 

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:48.219
 You will tell us how much part of our ten 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.980
 If you type the number four on the right of the comma 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.579
 The number will become 200 plus 30 plus 5 plus 4 parts of the ten 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.467
 You can write it to the body (1/10) multiplied by 4 

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:13.409
 Or in the form of 4 parts of the ten (not four dozen) 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.667
 And 4/10 is another representation of the same figure here 

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:24.001
 This rule is very important in mathematics 

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.777
 Where we can use decimal places to represent fractions 

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:32.505
 Thus (0.4) is 4 parts of ten 

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.585
 We can write this number in another way 

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:39.555
 Is that we can write two hundred 

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:48.834
 200, 35 and 4 out of ten 

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.900
 So we can write it in fractional number 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.210
 So, this is the decimal representation of number 235.4 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.864
 Also this number is written 

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:00.804
 In fractional number format, the number is 4/10 plus 235 

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:06.334
 But all these numbers represent 200 plus 30 plus 5 plus four of ten 

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:09.023
 Let us solve other examples 

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:11.534
 Suppose I write the number 

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:21.226
 Zero comma seven (0.7), in fact I will add 

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:25.863
 Another box to the right, to become 0.76 

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:29.265
 How would the figure of this figure be if I wrote it in a broken format? 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.550
 Let's say we only think about the number box 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.833
 We have a decimal separator 

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:35.404
 To the left of the comma are the single digits 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.696
 But the number here is 0, that is, we do not have any individual 

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:43.110
 We have seven parts of ten if this is the tens of thousands 

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:47.336
 And the box that is to her right hand 

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:50.664
 We'll divide it by 10 again 

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:52.975
 If this box represents the parts of a hundred 

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:59.081
 This box will represent parts of 100 

00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:03.732
 So we can rewrite the issue here like 0 

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:12.072
 We can rewrite the number zero plus seven out of ten 

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.582
 Plus seven out of ten 

00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.721
 (Not 7 tens but 7 tenths) plus six hundred 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.280
 Plus six hundred 

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:26.611
 (Not six hundred but six hundred) 

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:34.261
 Or we can write it as 0 plus 7 parts of ten 

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.852
 7/10 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:46.076
 7 parts of ten plus 6 parts of a hundred 

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:49.760
 We can type it 6/100 + 7/10 and it will mean the same number 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.252
 We can say here that we have 0, 1, 7, 10 and 6 hundred 

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.397
 We can write the number in another way if we want to write it in the form of a break 

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:01.074
 We can ignore zero 

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:04.245
 Because it will not change the total value 

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:09.965
 So I can collect 7 tenths with 6 of a hundred. In this case, how do I write 7 tenths as part of a hundred? 

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:14.863
 7 out of ten represents the same fraction 70 of a hundred 

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.803
 If 7/10 represents the same fraction 70/100 

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:23.865
 In other words, if we hit the place in ten 

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.754
 We can also hit the numerator in ten so that the value of the fracture does not change 

00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:32.813
 7/10 represents the same fraction 70/100 so we can collect 6/100 to it 

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.498
 How much will it be? 

00:05:36.498 --> 00:05:39.409
 Will become 76/100 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.409
 76 of a hundred 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.218
 Many people may say 

00:05:46.218 --> 00:05:49.395
 That this number is zero and seven seven 

00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:54.335
 Or seventy-six hundred 

00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:57.300
 This is a parts box of a hundred and this is a ten-part box 

00:05:57.313 --> 00:06:00.398
 Each part of ten is ten parts of a hundred 

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:03.865
 For example, this fraction can be seen as ten 

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:07.557
 Or that it is one hundred 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.007
 Thus, this represents 76 of a hundred 

00:06:10.007 --> 00:06:11.892
 We can continue adding the cells 

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:13.708
 If we go to the right of another box 

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.802
 We will get the parts section of A 

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:17.481
 Then the parts section of ten thousand 

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.252
 Every time we go to the right we divide by ten 

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:23.912
 While we can hit at ten every time we go left
