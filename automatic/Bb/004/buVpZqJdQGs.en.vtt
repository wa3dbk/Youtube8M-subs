 in the description of the good video we go 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 super fast we go into adjustments and go 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.930
 to find a new option that is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.050
 I only the only thing that occupies or everything 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.379
 left thus in the only thing that is occupied is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 is that it is to modify the color of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.269
 Well, our calls do not change 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.699
 the look to customize it from there in 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.429
 outside not busy nothing else now you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.840
 I want to show the tutorial so you can see 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.969
 exactly what is going to be us 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.949
 it's going to be a quick start indeed until 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.720
 the animation of our status bar we 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.710
 will change but that of our boot 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 logo will change us 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 you can see it actually makes us welcome 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.340
 to load 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 we hope we will say that we have a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.700
 new user experience and ready 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.460
 come out let's wait a few seconds in what 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.659
 that ends loading here already gives us the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.689
 developers 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.560
 and ready or that says to be able 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.180
 continue 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.450
 just play unlock 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.810
 and going to simulate a call ok you can see 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.299
 here we have what are the options that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 will give us when they speak to us now 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.429
 says that we block our device 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.390
 to continue with the tutorial 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.880
 you can see we have here the status bar 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.640
 we came back and now we have the option of 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 answer call and we see all the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.090
 options that come to us from the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.939
 microphone to put the fear of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.130
 the speaker's keyboard to add a 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.410
 tripartite call to send a video 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.220
 or to search for contacts ok 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.080
 we can download directly our 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.880
 status bar so we can see what 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.910
 notifications we have and what 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.849
 notifications have not really ok 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.370
 I liked it a lot and this 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.640
 I recommend infinitely we can hang 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.650
 the call and with that we have finished the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.040
 tutorial really friends I liked 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.079
 very much I recommend you 100% give it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.360
 an opportunity for value at best 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.980
 you like it maybe not but at least 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.100
 I liked it a lot 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.770
 it's a very easy very quick tweet very 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.170
 simple but that gives you several 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.400
 at the time of having a call so 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.990
 come on friends no longer here take your 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.160

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.750
 twix videos of cydia ok when they take out 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.610
 the jailbreak of 18 many have been 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.590
 asking that obviously we will have it 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.540
 in the channel but it still does not come out 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.670
 now we are only bringing tweets 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.290
