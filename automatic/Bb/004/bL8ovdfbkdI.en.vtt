we're<00:00:08.660> going<00:00:08.809> to<00:00:08.929> learn<00:00:09.049> some<00:00:09.320> basic

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
we're going to learn some basic

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.379 
we're going to learn some basic
terminology<00:00:10.039> that<00:00:10.760> will<00:00:10.879> help<00:00:11.000> beginners

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
terminology that will help beginners

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.720 
terminology that will help beginners
understand<00:00:12.080> more<00:00:12.379> about<00:00:12.590> music<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.190> what

understand more about music and what
guitar<00:00:14.090> teachers<00:00:14.510> might<00:00:14.779> be<00:00:14.930> trying<00:00:15.139> to<00:00:15.260> tell

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
guitar teachers might be trying to tell

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.710 
guitar teachers might be trying to tell
them<00:00:15.760> sometimes<00:00:16.760> music<00:00:17.090> and<00:00:17.359> playing<00:00:17.570> guitar

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
them sometimes music and playing guitar

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.660 
them sometimes music and playing guitar
can<00:00:18.080> seem<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.320> have<00:00:18.560> its<00:00:18.710> own<00:00:18.949> language<00:00:19.279> and

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
can seem to have its own language and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
can seem to have its own language and
the<00:00:19.910> truth<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:20.570> does

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.700 

these<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.100> all<00:00:29.310> chords<00:00:30.170> it's<00:00:31.170> surprising<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
these are all chords it's surprising to

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.320 
these are all chords it's surprising to
me<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:31.890> many<00:00:32.130> folks<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.580> have<00:00:32.760> come<00:00:32.970> see<00:00:33.150> me

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
me how many folks I have come see me

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.910 
me how many folks I have come see me
that<00:00:33.570> when<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> ask<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> chord<00:00:34.740> is

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that when I ask them what a chord is

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
that when I ask them what a chord is
they<00:00:35.070> can't<00:00:35.310> really<00:00:35.550> tell<00:00:35.790> me<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.500> chord<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
they can't really tell me a chord is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.620 
they can't really tell me a chord is
when<00:00:37.770> we're<00:00:37.920> playing<00:00:38.100> three<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.300> notes

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
when we're playing three or more notes

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.570 
when we're playing three or more notes
played<00:00:40.080> at<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.470> same<00:00:40.739> time<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.130> important

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
played at the same time so the important

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.310 
played at the same time so the important
thing<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.790> we're<00:00:45.210> playing<00:00:45.480> them<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> same

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
thing is we're playing them at the same

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
thing is we're playing them at the same
time<00:00:46.559> two<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.220> notes<00:00:47.489> played<00:00:47.940> does<00:00:48.750> not

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
time two or more notes played does not

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
time two or more notes played does not
make<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> chord<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:50.400> should<00:00:50.580> say<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.790> notes

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
make a chord or not should say two notes

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
make a chord or not should say two notes
at<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> same<00:00:51.570> time<00:00:51.900> does<00:00:52.080> not<00:00:52.110> make<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> chord

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
at the same time does not make a chord

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.389 
at the same time does not make a chord
three<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:53.970> more<00:00:54.440> does

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.760 

so<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.300> technical<00:01:01.660> definition<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.590> just

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
so the technical definition is just

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.619 
so the technical definition is just
going<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:02.980> be<00:01:03.129> three<00:01:03.520> or<00:01:03.699> more<00:01:03.969> notes<00:01:04.030> played

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
going to be three or more notes played

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to be three or more notes played
at<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.869> same<00:01:05.110> time<00:01:05.530> we<00:01:06.400> know<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.610> lot<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.000> chords

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
at the same time we know a lot of chords

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.850 
at the same time we know a lot of chords
like<00:01:07.360> G<00:01:07.630> E<00:01:07.869> minor<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.710> minor<00:01:09.479> D<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.560> that's<00:01:11.650> what

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
like G E minor a minor D so that's what

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.469 
like G E minor a minor D so that's what
a<00:01:11.890> chord<00:01:12.159> is<00:01:13.860> another<00:01:14.860> term<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.400> hear<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.850> scale

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
a chord is another term we hear is scale

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.450 
a chord is another term we hear is scale
a<00:01:22.200> scale<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.409> when<00:01:23.560> we're<00:01:23.680> playing<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.190> series

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
a scale is when we're playing a series

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.850 
a scale is when we're playing a series
of<00:01:24.610> single<00:01:25.030> notes<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.170> contrast<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.770> a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
of single notes so in contrast to a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.320 
of single notes so in contrast to a
chord<00:01:27.250> where<00:01:27.460> we<00:01:27.550> played<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.790> bunch<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
chord where we played a bunch at the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.580 
chord where we played a bunch at the
same<00:01:28.540> time<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:29.080> scale<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:34.360> simply<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:35.020> series<00:01:35.560> of

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
same time a scale is simply a series of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.290 
same time a scale is simply a series of
single<00:01:35.979> notes<00:01:36.280> there<00:01:36.490> doesn't<00:01:36.850> have<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.179> a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
single notes there doesn't have to be a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.050 
single notes there doesn't have to be a
minimal<00:01:37.840> amount<00:01:38.050> really<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.160> guess<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:39.759> long<00:01:39.789> as

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
minimal amount really I guess as long as

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.139 
minimal amount really I guess as long as
we're<00:01:40.179> past<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:45.220> for<00:01:45.460> example<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.909> was

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
we're past one like for example that was

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.850 
we're past one like for example that was
a<00:01:46.179> major<00:01:46.479> scale<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.050> got<00:01:47.170> seven<00:01:47.649> different

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
a major scale it's got seven different

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.710 
a major scale it's got seven different
notes<00:01:48.220> in<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.640> pentatonic<00:01:49.360> scale<00:01:51.330> has<00:01:52.330> five

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
notes in it a pentatonic scale has five

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.890 
notes in it a pentatonic scale has five
different<00:01:52.960> notes<00:01:53.319> a<00:01:53.580> chromatic<00:01:54.580> scale

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.109 

as<00:01:58.220> 12<00:01:59.220> different<00:01:59.700> notes

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:11.200 

we<00:02:04.119> often<00:02:04.570> hear<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.780> term<00:02:04.950> arpeggio

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.680 

and<00:02:11.300> arpeggio<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.980> specific<00:02:13.820> way<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.060> play<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and arpeggio is a specific way to play a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.340 
and arpeggio is a specific way to play a
chord<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.730> arpeggio<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.870> instead<00:02:18.230> of

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
chord all in arpeggio is is instead of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.560 
chord all in arpeggio is is instead of
strumming<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.980> chord<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.180> were<00:02:20.300> doing

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
strumming the chord like we were doing

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.280 
strumming the chord like we were doing
earlier<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:23.000> playing<00:02:23.360> one<00:02:23.690> note<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
earlier it's playing one note of the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.430 
earlier it's playing one note of the
chord<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> time

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.260 

and<00:02:29.530> there's<00:02:30.010> lots<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.490> different<00:02:30.550> ways<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.120> do

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
and there's lots of different ways to do

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.430 
and there's lots of different ways to do
this<00:02:31.450> we<00:02:31.600> can<00:02:31.720> do<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:31.930> with<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.170> finger

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
this we can do this with the finger

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.900 
this we can do this with the finger
picking

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.820 

we<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> known<00:02:36.110> chord<00:02:36.530> shape

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
we can do it with a known chord shape

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.200 
we can do it with a known chord shape
that<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.160> know<00:02:37.340> we<00:02:37.520> can<00:02:37.640> do<00:02:37.730> it<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> flat

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210
