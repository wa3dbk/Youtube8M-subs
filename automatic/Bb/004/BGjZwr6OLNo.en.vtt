going to be a modded pearlescent but

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.560 
going to be a modded pearlescent but
this<00:00:30.740> one<00:00:30.920> is<00:00:31.010> really<00:00:31.160> cool<00:00:31.400> it's<00:00:31.730> like<00:00:31.880> it's<00:00:32.449> a

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
this one is really cool it's like it's a

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.119 
this one is really cool it's like it's a
really<00:00:32.809> nice<00:00:33.020> looking<00:00:33.350> orange<00:00:33.559> I<00:00:33.800> like<00:00:33.980> it

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
really nice looking orange I like it

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.619 
really nice looking orange I like it
compared<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.550> all<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.670> other<00:00:34.850> orange<00:00:35.329> colors

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
compared to all the other orange colors

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.450 
compared to all the other orange colors
in<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.930> game<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.559> my<00:00:37.370> car<00:00:37.579> actually<00:00:37.760> has<00:00:38.120> a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
in the game and my car actually has a

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.160 
in the game and my car actually has a
has<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> red<00:00:40.879> pearlescent<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:41.870> gives<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.109> a

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
has a red pearlescent so it gives it a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.829 
has a red pearlescent so it gives it a
little<00:00:42.379> bit<00:00:42.589> more<00:00:42.829> of<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.039> red<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:43.699> but<00:00:44.510> it's

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
little bit more of a red to it but it's

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.989 
little bit more of a red to it but it's
it's<00:00:45.499> not<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:46.010> different<00:00:46.249> from<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.850> regular

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
it's not that different from the regular

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:48.969 
it's not that different from the regular
base<00:00:47.449> coat<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.050> have<00:00:48.229> just<00:00:48.499> the<00:00:48.710> orange

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
base coat that you have just the orange

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.180 
base coat that you have just the orange
itself<00:00:49.339> so<00:00:49.879> it's<00:00:49.999> really<00:00:50.120> cool<00:00:50.329> color<00:00:51.159> kind<00:00:52.159> of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
itself so it's really cool color kind of

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.649 
itself so it's really cool color kind of
reminds<00:00:52.429> me<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.609> like<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.819> General<00:00:53.239> Lee<00:00:53.269> car

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
reminds me of like the General Lee car

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.379 
reminds me of like the General Lee car
and<00:00:53.899> I<00:00:54.069> think<00:00:55.069> it<00:00:55.159> would<00:00:55.249> look<00:00:55.399> nice<00:00:55.639> honestly

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:56.389 
and I think it would look nice honestly

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.389 
and I think it would look nice honestly
it'd<00:00:56.780> probably<00:00:57.050> look<00:00:57.229> nice<00:00:57.530> as<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.769> secondary

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
it'd probably look nice as a secondary

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.329 
it'd probably look nice as a secondary
on<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:59.120> lot<00:00:59.389> of<00:00:59.510> cars<00:00:59.690> such<00:00:59.989> as<00:01:00.019> like<00:01:00.440> if<00:01:01.069> you<00:01:01.190> do

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
on a lot of cars such as like if you do

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.219 
on a lot of cars such as like if you do
sports<00:01:01.729> like<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.030> look<00:01:02.179> good<00:01:02.359> as<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.749> gesture

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
sports like it look good as the gesture

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.600 
sports like it look good as the gesture
or<00:01:03.469> on<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.859> gesture<00:01:04.220> as<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.339> secondary<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.290> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
or on the gesture as a secondary and the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.959 
or on the gesture as a secondary and the
the<00:01:07.610> zentorno<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:09.890> look<00:01:10.100> good<00:01:10.250> on<00:01:10.399> those<00:01:10.579> cars

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:10.969 
the zentorno it look good on those cars

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:12.999 
the zentorno it look good on those cars
probably<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:12.049> a<00:01:12.079> secondary<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:12.979> a

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
probably is a secondary and then a

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.330 
probably is a secondary and then a
primary<00:01:13.520> like<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:14.200> black<00:01:15.200> or<00:01:15.500> gray<00:01:15.799> or<00:01:15.829> maybe

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
primary like a black or gray or maybe

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.459 
primary like a black or gray or maybe
like<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.670> white<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.689> have<00:01:17.930> like<00:01:18.079> a<00:01:18.200> really

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
like a white so it have like a really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.910 
like a white so it have like a really
really<00:01:18.979> bright<00:01:19.369> like<00:01:19.899> intense<00:01:20.899> orange<00:01:21.409> as<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
really bright like intense orange as the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920 
really bright like intense orange as the
secondary<00:01:22.310> but<00:01:23.180> it's<00:01:23.390> it's<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.659> really<00:01:23.810> nice

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930
