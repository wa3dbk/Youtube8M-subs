00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:11.680
 It was the pitch of that softbank, but what time did it reach 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.130
 Construction is carried out at the end of January of this year 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.850
 a 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.360
 we 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:24.960
 It will be more than half a year when people are gathered 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.490
 The beginning of the lecturer was also awful, suddenly a large crane car is good 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 He was telling me competent way 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.720
 I want to be strong before this 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.850
 Almost thinking what happened 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:42.590
 If my grandfather caught construction Ness about 2 days ago Oise and heard 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.590
 Was what one song a ride 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.660
 This is the fourth floor of the fourth apartment, is this neighborhood 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.660
 About how much trigger 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.120
 I think a few people explore 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 I think 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.820
 The number is 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.820
 It is what 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.530
 Anyway, it 's all about us 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 As long as you are in the room on the south side 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.060
 Before him before this a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.510
 There is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.240
 I have it 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.240
 I'm looking at Hanta c clause but I live 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 truly 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.610
 Would be nice 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.040
 It's a bad thing, but what happens if naturalization is launched? 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:39.820
 I have a feeling of home every day 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 In the case of Junpa why moving it is also possible that reason 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:48.360
 It is difficult economically 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.390
 This is to only painted very one sale is it's right so so apartment 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.390
 Hmm 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.200
 For now nobody recruits me 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.360
 later 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.240
 It was good to do it all gt 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.240
 Something good It is a very good place without this 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.860
 People of Kenjo is not oppose be huh One more and more in favor of the installation of this knight thoracic cavity 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.850
 Is it 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.980
 Two-thirds of the people in this apartment 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.190
 From that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 Iron bridge 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 Because I got 35 specifications 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.130
 Many people are against 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.090
 A child living around 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 I got dyed from people living in the bad of the park 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.540
 Zen Gee's change of clothes Toka but is not extending good 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 Even if it is fired mentally 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.550
 It will be a burden 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.550
 It is Tan was Teku here also actual health risk of damage 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:04.030
 In the future like this before the rice is launched 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 The shop board is not so openly talked, and such a meaning machine is in the first half 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.200
 With mental stress 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:18.440
 Is it has begun because after all mental distress 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.440
 Warning change very tough think of the health damage to where it is radio's 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.690
 I wonder if you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.690
 I'm worried 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.370
 I'm I a, which also ate the leaves, such as Softbank and nose game today 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.680
 Softbank is that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.510
 Continue construction of the post office 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.450
 You were told that you would leave 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:48.950
 Quotation, etc. were also say such a thing that 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.780
 If you want to leave the factory reopened a lot of wanting to launch 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.209
 How many people today 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.209
 I guess as to who participated in the briefing 10 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.170
 I think and went to the country we are 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.940
 4 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.940
 Because I Welcome Whether you Tteyuu change also come to out city council officials 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.520
 We are today's 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.520
 Because we will have a briefing session 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.250
 I want to set the other side 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 Park cannonball in front of this owner 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.090
 There this because recently the construction resumed become 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:37.080
 Opposite 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:39.550
 Expressed also in Softbank difficult dense to us say that this resistance also want to be removed 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:45.969
 Because we do 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:50.569
 A briefing session is not correct in the first place because it is a 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:52.380
 In a different venue it is where our 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.240
 In the next room 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.670
 Of soft bank personnel 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.520
 Sprinkled 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:05.430
 Beneath still I say ridiculous I was talking about I guess is about 30 minutes 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.560
 I want to resume construction 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.230
 I did not think to say that by the pr corresponding 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.569
 It's at last 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.349
 we 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:21.300
 It's a dialect that everyone else agrees with 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:27.810
 It's been debated from all over you've eaten the whole scan 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:30.390
 There was an important aspect, too- to the person in charge of the book or the constitution of the Softbank company 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.220
 I do not know whether it is important 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:37.000
 Anyway a little 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.600
 You seem to doubt the eyes that can sing human beings 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.260
 Seafood constitution 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:46.370
 I think it is a Na or not it the material of the participants appeared to only 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.370
 I forgive everyone 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.159
 Thank you very much
