dirty<00:05:26.730> with<00:05:26.940> his<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.900> think<00:05:28.080> that<00:05:28.350> Chavez<00:05:28.890> is

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
dirty with his so I think that Chavez is

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.380 
dirty with his so I think that Chavez is
gonna<00:05:29.160> really<00:05:29.340> pull<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.640> one<00:05:29.910> out<00:05:30.030> he<00:05:30.210> might

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
gonna really pull this one out he might

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.560
