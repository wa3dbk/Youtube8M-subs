00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.590
 good afternoon dear subscribers and those 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.570
 who will accidentally take on my channel today 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.670
 as I promised show you the recipe 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.290
 muffins 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.600
 initially these colossus are preparing with 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.670
 apples and condensed milk in the middle 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.260
 I think it is a breathtaking taste but 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 the fact is that turkey is complicated 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.140
 find condensed milk 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.059
 so I replaced the thickened raisins you 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.690
 can dream on your own 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.239
 to wish 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.340
 what good is the kitchen where you can 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.510
 to dream 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.479
 condensed milk it will be 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.170
 wonderful taste why and so decided a 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.890
 because these muffins bite with 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.470
 milk 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.080
 certainly amazing so if you have 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.320
 there are handy condensed milk Palen 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 You can try it will be very tasty but 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:27.200
 we cook today with raisins and pears and 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 so products well wheels up to about 2 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.780
 cup sugar and a half tablespoons 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.739
 is not very well, sweet muffin 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.599
 put him a raisin and an apple or it can 

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:41.239
 be calush 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:44.690
 so it turns out quite sweet when 

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:47.810
 this is not clobber on the oil so much or 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.810
 I make two carrots in half a glass of carrots 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:58.580
 milk as baking powder for dough and 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:03.950
 vanilla there it is raisins pour hot 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.879
 water on them a little famous 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.849
 gathered moisture 

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:11.230
 oil should be at room temperature 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:15.970
 we add it some sugar and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.970
 beat with a mixer until smooth 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:28.300
 add egg butter and remaining sugar 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.300
 and continue to beat 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.250
 due to the fact that we have crushed butter 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.550
 but not left I hitched not 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.640
 suspension of knots butter float 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.840
 and then we still need to add milk 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.480
 to break lumps more thoroughly 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.540
 you can add a little flour first 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:59.450
 beat well now add 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:03.850
 vanillin and milk at room temperature 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.850
 so that our oil is not very offended 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.390
 mix well the rest 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.230
 flour 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.230
 and 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:25.939
 add to our mass and finally 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.400
 mix with oil 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.519
 the fact is that if your vote is gone 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.469
 melted down the text structure will turn out 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.730
 very gentle creamy flooded on 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.730
 this fox you do not succeed 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:48.550
 thanks to oil 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.550
 the dough is obtained by air as a souffle and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 accordingly those by the way will 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.100
 same 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.420
 Yes, and add to the dough sliced ​​fruit 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.370
 sliced clean cut 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:08.470
 mix dried raisins thoroughly 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:11.460
 With any vuyu form I laid out look not 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.840
 I needed smeared tins 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.840
 sheet metal fill the molds 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.760
 so that it was especially festive 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.390
 can be hidden inside a piece 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.390
 chocolates 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:55.020
 at 200 degrees about 25 minutes 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.919
 cupcakes get up a little bit already you can see that 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.009
 dough bulges out 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.310
