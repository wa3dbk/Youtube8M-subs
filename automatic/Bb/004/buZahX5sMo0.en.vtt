on<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.259> investment<00:01:25.920> doesn't<00:01:26.430> seem<00:01:26.670> quite<00:01:26.939> so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
on your investment doesn't seem quite so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
on your investment doesn't seem quite so
amazing<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.430> forget<00:01:29.430> about<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.850> four

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
amazing and forget about the four

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.749 
amazing and forget about the four
percent<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.659> maybe<00:01:30.840> getting<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.829> fact

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
percent you're maybe getting now in fact

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
percent you're maybe getting now in fact
I<00:01:33.060> wonder<00:01:33.869> how<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:34.950> term<00:01:35.340> track

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I wonder how all the long term track

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
I wonder how all the long term track
records<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.270> look<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.020> no

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
records would look if there was no

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
records would look if there was no
inflation<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.280> past<00:01:38.610> years

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
inflation in all these past years

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.420 
inflation in all these past years
because<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.930> fact<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.590> exponential

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
because in fact the exponential

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
because in fact the exponential
expansion<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> money<00:01:42.450> supply<00:01:42.689> seems<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
expansion of the money supply seems to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.749 
expansion of the money supply seems to
have<00:01:43.409> been<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> greatest<00:01:43.979> stock<00:01:44.340> market

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
have been the greatest stock market

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.490 
have been the greatest stock market
boost<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> wall<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.840> mean

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
boost to a wall I mean

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.240 
boost to a wall I mean
think<00:01:47.800> all<00:01:48.010> these<00:01:48.190> new<00:01:48.460> dollars<00:01:49.680> thin<00:01:50.680> air<00:01:50.890> end

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
think all these new dollars thin air end

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.450 
think all these new dollars thin air end
up<00:01:51.940> at<00:01:52.870> least<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.530> government<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.220> still

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
up at least the government is still

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.670 
up at least the government is still
willing<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.850> tell<00:01:55.030> us<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.210> small<00:01:55.600> numbers<00:01:55.930> m1

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
willing to tell us the small numbers m1

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.850 
willing to tell us the small numbers m1
how<00:01:57.340> much<00:01:57.550> cash<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:57.910> in<00:01:58.180> circulation<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.200> them

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
how much cash is in circulation and them

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.000 
how much cash is in circulation and them
to<00:02:00.160> adding<00:02:00.910> in<00:02:01.030> savings<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.870> CDs<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.530> less

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
to adding in savings and CDs of less

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.950 
to adding in savings and CDs of less
than<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.220> hundred<00:02:03.520> thousand<00:02:03.970> bucks<00:02:04.180> well<00:02:04.840> there

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
than a hundred thousand bucks well there

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.469 
than a hundred thousand bucks well there
are<00:02:05.020> money<00:02:05.380> market<00:02:05.800> funds<00:02:06.040> in<00:02:06.220> there<00:02:06.340> too<00:02:06.610> so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
why don't we need to know about m3 well

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.940 
why don't we need to know about m3 well
