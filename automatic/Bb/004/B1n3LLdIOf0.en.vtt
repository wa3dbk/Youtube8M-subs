00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
die there it's very similar to how we do

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.700

the sacrifices that we do with the
kosher<00:05:04.340> butchering<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.530> we<00:05:06.710> do<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.130> and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
kosher butchering and so we do that and

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.939 
kosher butchering and so we do that and
then<00:05:08.060> now<00:05:08.270> we<00:05:08.360> mix<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.020> Passover<00:05:09.710> bread

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949
