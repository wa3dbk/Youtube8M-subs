front of my hair longer to integrate

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
front of my hair longer to integrate
with<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.869> wigs<00:01:59.049> like<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.320> do<00:01:59.380> now<00:01:59.619> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
with the wigs like I do now and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.340 
with the wigs like I do now and
basically<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.539> I<00:02:01.600> pull<00:02:01.810> my<00:02:01.960> hair<00:02:02.140> line

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
basically because I pull my hair line

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.669 
basically because I pull my hair line
out<00:02:02.530> so<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.039> softens<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:05.440> I

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
out so that it softens it and then I

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.009 
out so that it softens it and then I
wanted<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.610> get<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> back<00:02:07.479> as<00:02:07.720> short<00:02:07.929> as

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
wanted to get the back as short as

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.520 
wanted to get the back as short as
possible<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:10.060> back<00:02:10.300> is<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.570> pretty<00:02:11.380> much

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
possible so the back is a pretty much

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.710 
possible so the back is a pretty much
like<00:02:11.709> freezer<00:02:12.010> bag<00:02:12.580> but<00:02:12.850> they<00:02:13.030> probably

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
like freezer bag but they probably

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
like freezer bag but they probably
shorter<00:02:14.380> than<00:02:14.530> some<00:02:14.739> guys<00:02:14.950> hair<00:02:15.220> back<00:02:15.430> there

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
shorter than some guys hair back there

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.090 
shorter than some guys hair back there
