00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hey guys this pod ragga nuke with

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820 
hey guys this pod ragga nuke with
another<00:00:09.330> video<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.870> today<00:00:09.960> i'll<00:00:10.679> be<00:00:10.740> showing

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
another video and today i'll be showing

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.490 
another video and today i'll be showing
you<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.340> build<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.910> 4<00:00:12.210> by<00:00:12.360> 4<00:00:12.599> volt<00:00:12.960> door

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.050 

it's<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> fastest<00:00:20.250> design<00:00:20.550> out<00:00:20.820> there

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
it's not the fastest design out there

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
it's not the fastest design out there
and<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> most<00:00:22.289> compact<00:00:22.619> either<00:00:22.859> but

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and it's not the most compact either but

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.109 
and it's not the most compact either but
it's<00:00:23.939> two<00:00:24.600> blocks<00:00:24.869> wide<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.949> very<00:00:26.460> very

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it's two blocks wide and it's very very

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
it's two blocks wide and it's very very
fast<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.109> also<00:00:28.730> it's<00:00:30.140> completely<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.260> sync

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
fast and also it's completely in sync

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.950 
fast and also it's completely in sync
which<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.699> the<00:00:32.820> feature<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.600> there's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
which I like the feature of so there's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.100 
which I like the feature of so there's
no<00:00:34.829> dirtiness<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
no dirtiness at all about it it just

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
no dirtiness at all about it it just
looks<00:00:37.800> fine<00:00:38.120> every<00:00:39.120> single<00:00:39.300> piston<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.809> in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
looks fine every single piston is in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
looks fine every single piston is in
sync<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.620> none<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.129> firing<00:00:41.489> before

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
sync that none of them are firing before

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.680 
sync that none of them are firing before
the<00:00:42.000> next<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> yeah<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:44.040> build<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the next so yeah let's build it so you

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.900 
the next so yeah let's build it so you
want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> start<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> 2<00:00:46.620> by<00:00:46.980> 12<00:00:47.340> area<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
want to start with a 2 by 12 area and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
want to start with a 2 by 12 area and
your<00:00:48.870> doors<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.230> facing<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
your doors can be facing in this

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
your doors can be facing in this
direction<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.489> once<00:00:51.059> you've<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> laid

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
direction so once you've got that laid

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
direction so once you've got that laid
out<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> find<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> four<00:00:53.460> Middle

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
out you want to find the four Middle

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
out you want to find the four Middle
blocks<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.350> front<00:00:55.710> row<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> then

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
blocks on this front row here and then

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.389 
blocks on this front row here and then
put<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.719> upwards<00:00:58.050> facing<00:00:58.199> sticky<00:00:58.680> pistons<00:00:59.100> on

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
put for upwards facing sticky pistons on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.040 
put for upwards facing sticky pistons on
those<00:00:59.579> blocks<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.300> knock<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.840> because

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
those blocks and knock these out because

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.799 
those blocks and knock these out because
they're<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.350> needed<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.699> build<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.600> two

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
they're not needed then build out two

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.530 
they're not needed then build out two
blocks<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.440> then<00:01:04.589> build<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:06.150> two

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
blocks and then build up to and put two

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.390 
blocks and then build up to and put two
sticky<00:01:06.900> business<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> knock<00:01:08.130> these

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
sticky business like that knock these

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.359 
sticky business like that knock these
out<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.780> build<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.710> blocks<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.100> there

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
out then build up two blocks from there

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520 
out then build up two blocks from there
and<00:01:11.610> two<00:01:11.939> blocks<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> then

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and two blocks out like that and then

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
and two blocks out like that and then
put<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.280> sticky<00:01:14.760> pistons<00:01:15.150> along<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> top

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
put for sticky pistons along the top

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.130 
put for sticky pistons along the top
like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.170> knock<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:18.509> do

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
like that knock these out and then do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
like that knock these out and then do
the<00:01:19.290> same<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.729> side<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.610> those

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the same thing up on this side so those

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.020 
the same thing up on this side so those
are<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.909> simple<00:01:24.840> Pistons<00:01:25.320> laid<00:01:25.860> out<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.850> now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
are the simple Pistons laid out so now

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
are the simple Pistons laid out so now
for<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.240> double<00:01:27.450> extenders<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.860> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
for your double extenders so you just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.550 
for your double extenders so you just
build<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.549> here<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.909> put<00:01:30.320> them<00:01:31.320> here

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
build that one here and put them here

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140 
build that one here and put them here
like<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.880> double

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
like that so you have to double

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
like that so you have to double
extenders<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.159> side

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
extenders there and then on this side

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
extenders there and then on this side
you<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> same<00:01:37.189> XO<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.530> your

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you need the same XO so that's all your

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460 
you need the same XO so that's all your
Pistons<00:01:40.860> laid<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.939> now<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
Pistons laid out so now you just want to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:58.670 
Pistons laid out so now you just want to
fill<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.490> floor<00:01:44.899> like<00:01:45.899> so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.530 

so<00:01:59.680> there<00:01:59.800> we<00:01:59.890> go<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:00.970> we<00:02:01.030> can<00:02:01.270> start

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
so there we go and now we can start

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.680 
so there we go and now we can start
worrying<00:02:01.990> up<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.790> start<00:02:04.030> off<00:02:04.150> with<00:02:04.390> you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
worrying up so to start off with you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
want to put two blocks here a 2 2 Peter

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.980 
want to put two blocks here a 2 2 Peter
facing<00:02:08.410> outwards<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.509> same<00:02:10.690> thing

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
facing outwards and do the same thing

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.620 
facing outwards and do the same thing
over<00:02:11.320> here<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.760> trapeze<00:02:13.000> facing<00:02:13.390> hours

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
over here to to trapeze facing hours

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.280 
over here to to trapeze facing hours
into<00:02:13.930> blocks<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:15.040> run<00:02:15.550> redstone<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
into blocks then run redstone on the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.199 
into blocks then run redstone on the
rest<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.680> blocks<00:02:17.920> along<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.700> row<00:02:18.970> like

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
rest of the blocks along this row like

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.080 
rest of the blocks along this row like
that<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.800> then<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.980> want<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.340> put<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.700> half

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
that and then you want to put a half

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.960 
that and then you want to put a half
slab<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:26.790> put<00:02:27.790> two

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
slab here and one here and then put two

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.100 
slab here and one here and then put two
blocks<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.810> both<00:02:29.140> sides<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.900> tick

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
blocks like that on both sides one tick

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.680 
blocks like that on both sides one tick
repeat<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.530> facing<00:02:32.920> outwards<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:34.239> redstone

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
repeat is facing outwards with redstone

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.320 
repeat is facing outwards with redstone
dust<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> half<00:02:35.530> slabs<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.239> to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
dust on the half slabs then you want to

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.030 
dust on the half slabs then you want to
put<00:02:37.989> blocks<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:40.020> then<00:02:41.020> redstone<00:02:41.830> dust

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
put blocks like this then redstone dust

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430 
put blocks like this then redstone dust
here<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:43.239> tick<00:02:43.420> repeater<00:02:43.840> there<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.260> then

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
here for tick repeater there and then

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.830 
here for tick repeater there and then
redstone<00:02:45.370> dust<00:02:45.520> there<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.060> do<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.420> same

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
redstone dust there and do the same

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.120 
redstone dust there and do the same
thing<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:48.010> other<00:02:48.040> side<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:54.750> so

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
thing on the other side like that so

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
thing on the other side like that so
then<00:02:57.130> um<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.450> need<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.430> put<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
then um all you need to do now is put a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.900 
then um all you need to do now is put a
redstone<00:03:01.780> torch<00:03:01.959> there<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:03.310> sticky<00:03:03.640> piston

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
redstone torch there it sticky piston

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.780 
redstone torch there it sticky piston
here<00:03:04.090> redstone<00:03:04.780> block<00:03:05.019> on<00:03:05.140> its<00:03:05.290> face<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:06.070> put

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
here redstone block on its face then put

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.509 
here redstone block on its face then put
two<00:03:06.940> blocks<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.320> 22<00:03:08.830> kavita<00:03:09.160> in

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
two blocks like this and a 22 kavita in

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.610 
two blocks like this and a 22 kavita in
that<00:03:10.090> gap<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:11.010> repeat<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> other<00:03:12.489> side

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that gap and repeat it on the other side

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.039 
that gap and repeat it on the other side
so<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:15.610> that<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.390> then<00:03:18.600> she<00:03:19.600> took<00:03:19.720> repeater

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
so like that and then she took repeater

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.520 
so like that and then she took repeater
there<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:21.239> your<00:03:22.239> double<00:03:22.570> extenders<00:03:23.110> will<00:03:23.320> now

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
there and your double extenders will now

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.910 
there and your double extenders will now
work<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:25.739> they're<00:03:26.739> all<00:03:27.010> retract<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.860> now<00:03:29.860> we

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
work so they're all retract and now we

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.610 
work so they're all retract and now we
just<00:03:30.400> need<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.790> wire<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.870> rest<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.560> these

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
just need to wire in the rest of these

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.280 
just need to wire in the rest of these
Pistons<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.510> want<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.690> come<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.019> top

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
Pistons so you want to come to the top

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.990 
Pistons so you want to come to the top
here<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.250> want<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.269> make<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.560> shape

thing here so like that we're so dust

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.560 
thing here so like that we're so dust
and<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.750> 4<00:03:53.200> tick<00:03:53.350> repeater<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:55.299> will<00:03:55.420> take

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
and a 4 tick repeater and that will take

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.750 
and a 4 tick repeater and that will take
care<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:56.110> topper<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.650> Pistons<00:03:57.190> because

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
care of this topper of Pistons because

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.930 
care of this topper of Pistons because
these<00:03:58.239> ones<00:03:58.510> will<00:03:58.660> get<00:03:58.810> budded<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.579> then<00:04:00.579> here

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
these ones will get budded and then here

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.810 
these ones will get budded and then here
you<00:04:01.540> want<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:03.120> pick<00:04:04.120> put<00:04:04.900> three<00:04:05.440> blocks<00:04:05.820> like

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
you want to pick put three blocks like

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.839 
you want to pick put three blocks like
the

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
the

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.970 
the
redstone<00:04:08.849> dust<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.239> top<00:04:09.269> then<00:04:09.810> two<00:04:10.560> rocks<00:04:10.769> here

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
redstone dust on top then two rocks here

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.300 
redstone dust on top then two rocks here
and<00:04:11.220> redstone<00:04:11.489> dust<00:04:11.760> there<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:13.010> repeat<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.189> on

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
and redstone dust there and repeat it on

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.640 
and redstone dust there and repeat it on
the<00:04:14.430> other<00:04:14.519> side<00:04:14.819> so<00:04:16.639> three<00:04:17.639> blocks<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:18.419> this

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
the other side so three blocks like this

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.620 
the other side so three blocks like this
redstone<00:04:19.650> dust<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.370> then<00:04:20.789> two<00:04:21.030> blocks<00:04:21.299> and

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
redstone dust and then two blocks and

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.520 
redstone dust and then two blocks and
then<00:04:21.780> redstone<00:04:22.320> there<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:24.139> your<00:04:25.139> door<00:04:25.380> will

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
then redstone there and your door will

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.950 
then redstone there and your door will
actually<00:04:25.860> now<00:04:26.009> work<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.570> want<00:04:27.780> it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
actually now work but if you want it

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.560 
actually now work but if you want it
completely<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.650> sync<00:04:28.949> then<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:30.120> need<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.449> do

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
completely in sync then you need to do

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.340 
completely in sync then you need to do
this<00:04:30.600> next<00:04:30.960> step<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.039> put<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:33.110> v-shape<00:04:34.110> like

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
this next step so you put a v-shape like

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.800 
this next step so you put a v-shape like
this<00:04:34.550> right<00:04:35.550> send<00:04:35.759> us<00:04:35.910> there<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.389> 12

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
this right send us there and a 12

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.150 
this right send us there and a 12
greeter<00:04:37.139> there<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.120> do<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> same<00:04:39.419> thing<00:04:39.690> here

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
greeter there and do the same thing here

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.830 
greeter there and do the same thing here
we're<00:04:41.160> stoned<00:04:41.400> us<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.789> and<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.180> 12<00:04:42.539> creature

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
we're stoned us there and a 12 creature

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.520 
we're stoned us there and a 12 creature
there<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.910> will<00:04:45.600> be<00:04:45.840> all<00:04:46.050> in<00:04:46.229> sync

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
there and so that will be all in sync

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.610 
there and so that will be all in sync
and<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.889> all<00:04:47.039> completely<00:04:47.580> work<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.419> let's<00:04:49.380> test

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
and it all completely work so let's test

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.830 
and it all completely work so let's test
it<00:04:49.860> I'll<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.280> put<00:04:50.580> rock<00:04:51.300> here<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.690> then<00:04:51.810> a

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
it I'll just put rock here and then a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.150 
it I'll just put rock here and then a
lever<00:04:52.169> there<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.949> test<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:54.380> so<00:04:55.380> that's<00:04:55.590> all<00:04:55.949> in

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
lever there to test it so that's all in
