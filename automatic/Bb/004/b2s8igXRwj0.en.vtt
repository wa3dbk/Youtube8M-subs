open<00:04:58.790> for<00:04:59.180> special<00:04:59.600> exhibitions<00:05:00.230> I<00:05:00.590> don't

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
open for special exhibitions I don't

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.040 
open for special exhibitions I don't
think<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.520> will<00:05:01.610> be<00:05:01.760> open<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:02.270> regularly<00:05:02.720> as

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
think it will be open as regularly as

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.160 
think it will be open as regularly as
people<00:05:03.440> think<00:05:03.650> that<00:05:03.860> will<00:05:04.130> be<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:05.170> think

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
people think that will be I think

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.930 
people think that will be I think
there's<00:05:07.010> things<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.310> could<00:05:07.610> be<00:05:07.730> done<00:05:07.910> to

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
there's things that could be done to

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.150 
there's things that could be done to
keep<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.390> open<00:05:08.480> but<00:05:09.110> for<00:05:09.380> whatever<00:05:09.620> reason

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
keep it open but for whatever reason

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.260 
keep it open but for whatever reason
they<00:05:10.340> choose<00:05:10.580> not<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.410> go<00:05:12.410> forward<00:05:12.770> with<00:05:12.920> that

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
they choose not to go forward with that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.340 
they choose not to go forward with that
hopefully<00:05:14.270> maybe<00:05:14.450> a<00:05:14.600> later<00:05:14.870> date<00:05:15.080> they<00:05:15.230> may

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
hopefully maybe a later date they may

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.970 
hopefully maybe a later date they may
look<00:05:15.500> at<00:05:15.650> that

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
look at that

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.150 
look at that
I<00:05:16.210> don't<00:05:17.210> put<00:05:17.330> a<00:05:17.360> lot<00:05:17.480> of<00:05:17.630> faith<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.160> but

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
I don't put a lot of faith in that but

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.250 
I don't put a lot of faith in that but
