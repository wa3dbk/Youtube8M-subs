 Sunday 28th April started on 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.769
 adria circuit 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 the new season of the alpha revaival cup 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 promoted by the classic gps 14 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.480
 competitors have created a beautiful one 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 race fought until almost the end that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
 saw the victory of roberto arnaldi 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 with his gt am that preceded in 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.859
 general classification 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.240
 two blonddetti team crews 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.880
 from Florence 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.590
 the ami rocco with hagi tv2000 and biondetti 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590
 gimignans with a similar car 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.649
 the result on the track was though 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.930
 different considering that to cut the 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.210
 finish line in second and third place later 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.769
 having given birth to a battle 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.050
 they were memorable with knuckles and bumps 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.449
 were the Milanese alessandro morteo e 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.839
 the Austrian franz salma also al 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.489
 gt am steering wheel 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.409
 however a verification of the cars at 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.000
 weight has decreed disqualification for 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.440
 both of them 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 the event that has concentrated 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.030
 trials and race in a few hours prevented the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.310
 two pilots to provide to make the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.380
 cars fit for regulation after that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.990
 the problem had emerged at the end of the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.970
 official tests for the two drivers the race 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.009
 of adria then turned into a 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.259
 great way to try the cars in 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.210
 particularly for morteo whose car is 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.880
 been finished preparing only three 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.649
 days before the race already in the tests 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.929
 it had emerged that on all the participants 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.350
 the victory would have been played between 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:37.360
 arnaldi bucci morteo is safe despite being 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.850
 left last already on the second lap 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.340
 morteo was fighting with knuckles and pits 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 that with his little gta junior 1300 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.399
 could keep up with the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 most powerful cars 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 for corpse he too started in line at 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.939
 group the ascent to the summit was 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 longer and joined the first after two 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.289
 thirds of the race after a series of 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.090
 exciting overtaking for the first 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.219
 position we arrived at the pit stop 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.860
 mandatory for driver change or 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.989
 30 seconds stop right in the pits 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.849
 yet another twist with roberto 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.980
 holes that re-entered with the pedal of the 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.360
 brake totally on the fly 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.730
 then continued in the race 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.739
 ranking at the end of the eleventh but 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.019
 especially picking up the full points 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.030
 for the championship proving that the alpha 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.900
 revaival cup is something that is sought after 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.900
 with great will 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.040
 even Arnaldi was the victim of a problem 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.780
 to the clutch pedal 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.560
 forced to return a second one 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.560
 in the pits 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.410
 the intervention of the mechanic reported 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.270
 all right and the expert pilot will 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.550
 put in pursuit of death or is 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.860
 save the first was plagued by problems 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.870
 mechanics with an engine that he didn't want 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.870
 learn to always shoot at 4 c 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
 only in the last three rounds the ranking 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.700
 assumed a certain outline with arnaldi 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.160
 who won before death or 6 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.620
 seconds and body now satisfied with the 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.620
 third place at 49 seconds posting 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.630
 next appointment is for 22 23 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.430

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.210
