00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
experimenting with right now is actually

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.870 
experimenting with right now is actually
being<00:00:27.069> you<00:00:27.339> see<00:00:27.609> or<00:00:27.880> oxy<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.329> don't<00:00:28.539> know<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
being you see or oxy I don't know so

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.939 
being you see or oxy I don't know so
it's<00:00:31.149> essentially<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:33.160> minute<00:00:34.120> later<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.410> you

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
it's essentially a minute later as you

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.410 
it's essentially a minute later as you
don't<00:00:36.129> know<00:00:36.250> played<00:00:36.519> all<00:00:36.670> lets<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:37.000> put<00:00:37.269> two

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
don't know played all lets you put two

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.299 
don't know played all lets you put two
on<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.629> bottom<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:38.019> draw<00:00:38.170> six<00:00:38.530> but<00:00:39.100> it's<00:00:39.219> a

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
on the bottom and draw six but it's a

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.660 
on the bottom and draw six but it's a
faster<00:00:39.760> version<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.269> it<00:00:40.390> being<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.750> basic<00:00:41.199> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
faster version of it being a basic and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.079 
faster version of it being a basic and
I've<00:00:42.670> been<00:00:42.820> looking<00:00:43.149> at<00:00:43.539> this<00:00:43.899> combined<00:00:44.679> with

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
I've been looking at this combined with

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.849 
I've been looking at this combined with
Roseanne's<00:00:46.089> research<00:00:46.629> which<00:00:47.170> easily<00:00:47.559> which

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
Roseanne's research which easily which

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.709 
Roseanne's research which easily which
makes<00:00:48.070> for<00:00:48.250> easy<00:00:48.429> access<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.969> get<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.449> we've

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
makes for easy access to get the we've

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.560 
makes for easy access to get the we've
seen<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.679> there's<00:00:51.579> also<00:00:51.789> some<00:00:52.120> other<00:00:52.179> cards

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
seen and there's also some other cards

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.419 
seen and there's also some other cards
that<00:00:52.690> can<00:00:52.870> be<00:00:52.960> combined<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.649> make<00:00:53.679> it<00:00:53.920> faster

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
that can be combined to make it faster

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.299 
that can be combined to make it faster

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
receiving way too much height but you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.300 
receiving way too much height but you
can<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.890> 14<00:01:32.490> 16<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> 22<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.780> bench<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
can do 14 16 and 22 the bench and it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.150 
can do 14 16 and 22 the bench and it's
130<00:01:35.880> HP<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> stage<00:01:36.840> 2<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.650> only<00:01:37.770> has<00:01:37.980> one

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
130 HP for a stage 2 and it only has one

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.100 
130 HP for a stage 2 and it only has one
of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> treatments<00:01:38.520> which<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.570> obviously

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
of the treatments which is obviously

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.680 
of the treatments which is obviously
really<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.800> for<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> stage<00:01:41.280> 2<00:01:41.580> I<00:01:41.820> don't<00:01:42.420> think

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
really good for a stage 2 I don't think

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.780 
really good for a stage 2 I don't think
it's<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.170> dominate<00:01:43.470> perform<00:01:44.280> at<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it's going to dominate perform at like

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.240 
it's going to dominate perform at like
arteaga<00:01:45.270> landed<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:45.840> year<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:47.130> it's

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
arteaga landed this year I think it's

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.360 
arteaga landed this year I think it's
being<00:01:47.520> way<00:01:47.760> too<00:01:47.790> over<00:01:48.300> height<00:01:49.010> but<00:01:50.010> it's<00:01:50.190> still

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
being way too over height but it's still

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.920 
being way too over height but it's still
an<00:01:50.490> interesting<00:01:51.000> card<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.630> it'll<00:01:51.720> do

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
an interesting card and I think it'll do

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.160 
an interesting card and I think it'll do
good<00:01:51.960> during<00:01:52.890> battle<00:01:53.160> rose<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.550> say<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> least

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
good during battle rose to say the least

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
good during battle rose to say the least
