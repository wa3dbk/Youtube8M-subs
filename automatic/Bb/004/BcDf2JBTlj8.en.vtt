interesting machine if you can can you
look<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.549> close-up<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.869> has<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
look at this close-up it has a this is

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.350 
look at this close-up it has a this is
the<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.900> drive<00:01:40.200> chain<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.360> this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the this is the the drive chain and this

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
the this is the the drive chain and this
is<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> lever<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
is that and this is the lever that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
is that and this is the lever that
engages<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:45.180> drive<00:01:45.420> cane<00:01:46.220> what<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.399> does<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
engages the drive cane what that does is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
engages the drive cane what that does is
basically<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:49.070> moves<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.460> front<00:01:51.299> wheel<00:01:52.290> and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
this is turtle speed and this is rabbit

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.779 
this is turtle speed and this is rabbit
speed<00:02:08.330> when<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:09.110> want<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.610> when<00:02:10.610> you're<00:02:10.759> doing

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
speed when you want to when you're doing

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.790 
speed when you want to when you're doing
the<00:02:11.090> edges<00:02:11.450> or<00:02:11.690> when<00:02:11.870> you're<00:02:12.020> using<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
the edges or when you're using the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.110 
the edges or when you're using the
aerator<00:02:13.100> for<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> first<00:02:13.550> time<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.910> want<00:02:14.030> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
aerator for the first time you want to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.750 
aerator for the first time you want to
keep<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.780> lower<00:02:15.350> speed<00:02:15.830> when<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.580> want

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
keep it on a lower speed when you want

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.870 
keep it on a lower speed when you want
to<00:02:16.850> go<00:02:17.030> faster<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.750> want<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> put<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
to go faster then you want to put it

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.180 
to go faster then you want to put it
closer<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.239> rabbit<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.680> other<00:02:21.800> thing<00:02:22.069> you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
closer to the rabbit the other thing you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.390 
closer to the rabbit the other thing you
should<00:02:22.220> know<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.670> how<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.880> start<00:02:23.239> your<00:02:23.420> machine

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
should know is how to start your machine

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.130 
should know is how to start your machine
here<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.550> have<00:02:25.700> an<00:02:25.819> aerator<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> honda

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
here you have an aerator this is a honda

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.290 
here you have an aerator this is a honda
engines<00:02:27.560> honda<00:02:27.650> engines<00:02:28.520> are<00:02:28.670> unique<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
engines honda engines are unique in the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
engines honda engines are unique in the
fact<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.350> on<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.890> off<00:02:31.040> switch

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
fact that they have a on and off switch

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.430 
fact that they have a on and off switch
in<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> front<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.600> before<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.110> start<00:02:33.200> your

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
in the front so before you start your

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.870 
in the front so before you start your
aerator<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.920> want<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.190> make<00:02:34.340> sure<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.730> your

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
aerator you want to make sure that your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.550 
aerator you want to make sure that your
switch<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.510> on<00:02:36.550> also<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:39.019> want<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> make<00:02:39.530> sure

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
switch is on also you want to make sure

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.070 
switch is on also you want to make sure
that<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.730> put<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.590> top<00:02:42.830> lever<00:02:43.190> here<00:02:43.580> is

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
that you put this this top lever here is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.690 
that you put this this top lever here is
with<00:02:45.080> your<00:02:45.350> choke<00:02:45.590> lever<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.489> want<00:02:46.640> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
with your choke lever so you want to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.789 
with your choke lever so you want to
have<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:47.030> back<00:02:47.390> all<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> way<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:48.620> one

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
have this back all the way and this one

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.140 
have this back all the way and this one
is<00:02:48.950> for<00:02:49.100> your<00:02:49.190> fuel<00:02:49.430> line<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.910> want<00:02:50.090> to
