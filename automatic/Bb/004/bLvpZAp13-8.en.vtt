I see people leaving their homes because

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.190 
I see people leaving their homes because
they<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.550> sustain<00:01:21.850> themselves<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.810> they're

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
they can sustain themselves and they're

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.940 
they can sustain themselves and they're
becoming<00:01:24.190> homeless<00:01:24.970> in<00:01:25.600> nearby<00:01:26.080> towns<00:01:26.680> and

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
becoming homeless in nearby towns and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.420 
becoming homeless in nearby towns and
cities<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:27.759> is<00:01:27.940> so<00:01:28.149> sad<00:01:28.649> what<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:29.830> need<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.280> do

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
cities this is so sad what we need to do

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.420 
cities this is so sad what we need to do
is<00:01:30.790> keep<00:01:31.000> much<00:01:31.330> more<00:01:31.570> water<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.440> land<00:01:32.680> so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
is keep much more water on the land so

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.490 
is keep much more water on the land so
the<00:01:33.729> nature<00:01:34.360> can<00:01:34.600> do<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.899> work<00:01:35.080> for<00:01:35.350> us

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
the nature can do the work for us

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.010 
the nature can do the work for us
and<00:01:35.770> supply<00:01:36.250> us<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.580> water<00:01:36.790> we<00:01:37.300> don't<00:01:37.509> need<00:01:37.750> to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
and supply us the water we don't need to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.160 
and supply us the water we don't need to
depend<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.880> commuting<00:01:39.880> water<00:01:40.090> from<00:01:40.660> very<00:01:40.899> far

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
depend on commuting water from very far

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.520 
depend on commuting water from very far
away

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
away

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.490 
away
we<00:01:42.190> need<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.550> depend<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.240> local<00:01:43.540> water<00:01:43.930> going

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
we need to depend on local water going

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.160 
we need to depend on local water going
into<00:01:44.770> local<00:01:45.280> aquifers<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.149> then<00:01:46.720> being

into local aquifers and then being

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.169 
into local aquifers and then being
pumped<00:01:47.560> locally<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.310> supporting<00:01:49.030> the

the<00:01:51.190> land<00:01:52.770> when<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.920> came<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:54.720> seven<00:01:55.720> years

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
the land when we came here seven years

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.630 
the land when we came here seven years
ago<00:01:56.050> my<00:01:56.619> wife<00:01:56.649> my<00:01:57.280> daughter

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
ago my wife my daughter

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.630 
ago my wife my daughter
can<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:58.810> looked<00:01:59.050> like<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.380> movie<00:01:59.590> it<00:02:00.399> was

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
can I this looked like the movie it was

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.150 
can I this looked like the movie it was
a<00:02:00.670> lunar<00:02:01.060> landscape<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.750> was<00:02:01.929> very<00:02:02.200> white<00:02:02.530> very

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
a lunar landscape it was very white very

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.880 
a lunar landscape it was very white very
barren<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.819> we<00:02:04.660> wanted<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.289> plant<00:02:05.649> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
barren and we wanted to plant the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.949 
barren and we wanted to plant the
tropical<00:02:06.340> dry<00:02:06.580> evergreen<00:02:06.850> forests<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.720> this

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
tropical dry evergreen forests on this

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.230 
tropical dry evergreen forests on this
barren<00:02:08.289> land<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.800> we<00:02:09.369> started<00:02:09.729> by<00:02:09.850> planting

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
barren land and we started by planting

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.840 
barren land and we started by planting
trees<00:02:10.290> soon<00:02:11.290> enough<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.740> discovered<00:02:12.250> that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
trees soon enough we discovered that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.960 
trees soon enough we discovered that
planting<00:02:13.390> trees<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.990> not<00:02:14.290> enough<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.760> have

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
planting trees is not enough and we have

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.820 
planting trees is not enough and we have
to<00:02:16.270> keep<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> water<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.500> land

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
to keep the water on the land

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.180 
to keep the water on the land
what<00:02:18.160> makes<00:02:18.459> this<00:02:18.640> land<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.840> arid<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.950> fact

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
what makes this land so arid is the fact

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.100 
what makes this land so arid is the fact
that<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> rainwater<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.540> falls<00:02:22.599> in<00:02:22.990> the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
that all the rainwater that falls in the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.160 
that all the rainwater that falls in the
monsoon<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:24.190> goes<00:02:24.430> away<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.840> started

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
monsoon just goes away so we started

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.620 
monsoon just goes away so we started
doing<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.590> lot<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.190> water<00:02:27.700> conservation<00:02:28.000> work

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
doing a lot of water conservation work

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.380 
doing a lot of water conservation work
just<00:02:29.290> stopping<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.220> water<00:02:30.430> everywhere<00:02:31.209> we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
just stopping the water everywhere we

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.250 
just stopping the water everywhere we
could<00:02:31.599> true<00:02:32.349> check<00:02:33.040> dams<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.810> swells<00:02:34.810> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
could true check dams and swells and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.670 
could true check dams and swells and
bands<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.370> gabions<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.270> different<00:02:37.680> methods

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
bands and gabions and different methods

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.790 
bands and gabions and different methods
of<00:02:38.830> stopping<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> water<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.590> has

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
of stopping the water and this has

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.660 
of stopping the water and this has
worked<00:02:41.980> miracles<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:44.080> result<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.920> 6<00:02:45.310> meters

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
worked miracles the result is 6 meters

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.030 
worked miracles the result is 6 meters
increase<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.390> water<00:02:46.599> table<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.650> lot<00:02:47.890> of

increase in the water table and a lot of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.580 
increase in the water table and a lot of
