00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hi I'm Gary Malek and in this video I'm

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.690 
hi I'm Gary Malek and in this video I'm
gonna<00:00:03.240> show<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> change<00:00:03.840> out<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.080> CPU

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:04.700 
gonna show you how to change out of CPU

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.950 
gonna show you how to change out of CPU
now<00:00:05.700> there<00:00:06.060> are<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> few<00:00:06.299> things<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.750> have<00:00:06.779> to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
now there are a few things you have to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.419 
now there are a few things you have to
understand<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.859> there<00:00:08.069> are<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.220> lot<00:00:08.400> of

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
understand that there are a lot of

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.459 
understand that there are a lot of
different<00:00:08.730> CPUs<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.480> there's<00:00:10.170> different

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
different CPUs and there's different

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
different CPUs and there's different
different<00:00:11.040> sockets<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.550> slots<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.059> types

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
different sockets and slots and types

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.089 
different sockets and slots and types
many<00:00:13.049> motherboards<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.650> different<00:00:13.950> and

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
many motherboards are different and

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.609 
many motherboards are different and
along<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.580> fans<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.089> cores<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:16.260> generally

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
along with fans and cores but generally

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.349 
along with fans and cores but generally
I<00:00:16.800> mean<00:00:16.890> they<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.310> follow<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> same<00:00:17.789> premise

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I mean they all follow the same premise

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.920 
I mean they all follow the same premise
which<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.230> very<00:00:19.560> very<00:00:20.520> careful<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.750> not

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
which is be very very careful you do not

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.210 
which is be very very careful you do not
want<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> rough<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.619> these<00:00:22.769> things<00:00:22.980> they

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
want to be rough with these things they

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
want to be rough with these things they
have<00:00:23.340> tiny<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:24.150> pins<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.140> they<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.380> bend

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
have tiny little pins and they can bend

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.109 
have tiny little pins and they can bend
and<00:00:25.949> create<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> nightmare<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and create a nightmare and you have to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
and create a nightmare and you have to
be<00:00:27.210> very<00:00:27.449> very<00:00:27.779> careful<00:00:28.080> now<00:00:28.980> you're<00:00:29.789> gonna

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
be very very careful now you're gonna

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.269 
be very very careful now you're gonna
have<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.810> fan<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.920> already<00:00:32.160> if

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
have to have a fan on here already if

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
have to have a fan on here already if
you<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> change<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.140> make<00:00:34.140> sure<00:00:34.170> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you want to change it so make sure you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.600 
you want to change it so make sure you
can<00:00:34.530> figure<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.770> how<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.920> remove<00:00:35.100> your<00:00:35.430> fan

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
can figure out how to remove your fan

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.330 
can figure out how to remove your fan
which<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.450> easy<00:00:36.739> but<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> be

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which is really easy but you have to be

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.810 
which is really easy but you have to be
careful<00:00:38.809> now<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> fan<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> slot<00:00:41.790> for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
careful now this fan here has a slot for

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.069 
careful now this fan here has a slot for
a<00:00:42.030> nice<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.390> screwdriver

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
a nice little screwdriver

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
a nice little screwdriver
you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.160> push<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> right<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you have to just push it right in the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
you have to just push it right in the
lip<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.719> very<00:00:45.960> firm<00:00:46.289> now<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> push<00:00:46.890> down

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
lip be very firm now as you push down

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
lip be very firm now as you push down
and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.460> pull<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.750> should<00:00:48.899> come

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and then pull it out and it should come

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
and then pull it out and it should come
right<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.289> again<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.340> careful<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
right off again be very careful if you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
right off again be very careful if you
slip<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.320> wanna<00:00:52.469> jar<00:00:52.680> your

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
slip you don't wanna jar your

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
slip you don't wanna jar your
motherboard<00:00:53.690> make<00:00:54.690> sure<00:00:54.809> everything<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
motherboard make sure everything is

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
motherboard make sure everything is
unplugged<00:00:55.680> that's<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.280> thing<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> always

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
unplugged that's one thing you always

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
unplugged that's one thing you always
have<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.059> worry<00:00:57.239> about<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have to worry about now here we have the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.420 
have to worry about now here we have the
processor<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> nice<00:01:00.120> little<00:01:00.270> arm<00:01:00.570> here

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
processor there's a nice little arm here

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.820 
processor there's a nice little arm here
this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.699> AMD<00:01:02.910> processor<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.140> again

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this is an AMD processor but again

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.600 
this is an AMD processor but again
Intel's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
Intel's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.340 
Intel's
they<00:01:05.850> all<00:01:06.030> generally<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> same<00:01:07.049> kind<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
they all generally have the same kind of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.289 
they all generally have the same kind of
premise<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.790> arm<00:01:09.000> here

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
premise you just have a little arm here

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.050 
premise you just have a little arm here
you're<00:01:09.510> gonna<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> lift<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.729> take<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> out

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you're gonna want to lift up take it out

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.490 
you're gonna want to lift up take it out
now<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.570> processor<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.350> come<00:01:13.470> right

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
now the processor will just come right

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.999 
now the processor will just come right
out<00:01:13.710> nice<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> maybe<00:01:15.530> tried<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> touch<00:01:16.799> too

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
out nice and maybe tried to touch too

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.590 
out nice and maybe tried to touch too
many<00:01:17.189> things<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.060> here

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
many things and as you can see here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
there's an arrow up the top of this this

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.410 
there's an arrow up the top of this this
this<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.380> mean<00:01:23.270> that's<00:01:24.270> gonna

this here and that I mean that's gonna
go<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.380> corner<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.369> no<00:01:26.520> pins

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
go up here on this corner with no pins

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.929 
go up here on this corner with no pins
there's<00:01:28.710> pins<00:01:28.950> missing<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.490> top<00:01:29.729> two

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
there's pins missing in these top two

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
there's pins missing in these top two
corners<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.860> there's<00:01:31.860> pins<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
corners and there's pins on these so it
