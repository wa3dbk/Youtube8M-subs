00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
through it again and insisting that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.470 
through it again and insisting that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
stand by what I said that Nintendo

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.590 
stand by what I said that Nintendo
should<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.710> Wii<00:00:32.009> U<00:00:32.039> 3d<00:00:32.610> Mario<00:00:33.030> game<00:00:33.300> that's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
should make a Wii U 3d Mario game that's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.110 
should make a Wii U 3d Mario game that's
less<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> 3d<00:00:34.559> Land<00:00:34.829> sequel<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> more<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
less of a 3d Land sequel and more of a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.139 
less of a 3d Land sequel and more of a
successor<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.289> n64<00:00:37.909> masterpiece<00:00:38.909> and

successor to this n64 masterpiece and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.849 
successor to this n64 masterpiece and
hopefully<00:00:39.780> by<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:39.989> time<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.499> review<00:00:40.800> is
