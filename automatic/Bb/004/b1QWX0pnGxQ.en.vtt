hero arts showing you a technique called

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:32.130 
hero arts showing you a technique called
dry<00:00:25.810> embossing<00:00:26.079> with<00:00:26.380> die-cuts<00:00:26.890> I<00:00:30.930> fused<00:00:31.930> the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
dry embossing with die-cuts I fused the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.410 
dry embossing with die-cuts I fused the
watercolor<00:00:32.739> petals<00:00:33.250> which<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:33.699> clear<00:00:34.090> set

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
watercolor petals which is a clear set

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.930 
watercolor petals which is a clear set
and<00:00:34.780> I've<00:00:35.050> used<00:00:35.290> also<00:00:35.559> my<00:00:35.890> digital<00:00:36.460> die-cuts

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
and I've used also my digital die-cuts

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.360 
and I've used also my digital die-cuts
to<00:00:37.180> create<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.960> couple<00:00:38.350> layers<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.980> paper<00:00:39.160> and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
to create a couple layers of paper and

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.210 
to create a couple layers of paper and
then<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.150> ran<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.480> through<00:00:40.510> my<00:00:40.960> Big<00:00:41.680> Shot<00:00:41.710> to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
then I ran it through my Big Shot to

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.250 
then I ran it through my Big Shot to
create<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.640> nice<00:00:43.030> embossed<00:00:43.480> layered<00:00:43.839> effect<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
create a nice embossed layered effect so

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.469 
create a nice embossed layered effect so
what<00:00:47.440> I<00:00:47.470> have<00:00:47.769> here<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:48.549> some<00:00:48.580> of<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.119> digital

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
what I have here is some of the digital

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.509 
what I have here is some of the digital
die-cuts<00:00:50.140> with<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.589> matching<00:00:50.979> stamps<00:00:51.460> that

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
die-cuts with the matching stamps that

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.130 
die-cuts with the matching stamps that
I'll<00:00:51.670> be<00:00:51.790> using<00:00:52.059> for<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.299> card<00:00:52.540> today<00:00:52.809> and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
I'll be using for the card today and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.350 
I'll be using for the card today and
what<00:00:53.739> I've<00:00:53.830> done<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.159> I've<00:00:54.339> cut<00:00:54.610> three<00:00:55.059> layers

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
what I've done is I've cut three layers

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.509 
what I've done is I've cut three layers
of<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:56.140> paper<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.619> this<00:00:56.710> is<00:00:56.860> on<00:00:57.010> 80-pound

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
of the paper and this is on 80-pound

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.710 
of the paper and this is on 80-pound
cardstock<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.320> for<00:00:59.979> each<00:01:00.159> type<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:01.089> flower<00:01:01.330> or

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
cardstock so for each type of flower or

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.689 
cardstock so for each type of flower or
image<00:01:02.290> that<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.530> want<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.769> do<00:01:02.920> I'm<00:01:03.220> going<00:01:03.610> to

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
image that I want to do I'm going to

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.700 
image that I want to do I'm going to
glue<00:01:03.850> together<00:01:04.059> three<00:01:04.689> layers<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.260> what

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
glue together three layers and what

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.320 
glue together three layers and what
happens<00:01:06.070> is<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.369> creates<00:01:06.790> almost<00:01:07.060> a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
happens is this creates almost a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.140 
happens is this creates almost a
chipboard<00:01:07.659> type<00:01:08.560> thickness<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.460> I've<00:01:10.030> just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
chipboard type thickness and I've just

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.880 
chipboard type thickness and I've just
used<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.510> glue<00:01:10.720> stick<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:11.409> glue<00:01:11.770> everything

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
used a glue stick to glue everything

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.149 
used a glue stick to glue everything
together<00:01:12.310> if<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:14.259> don't<00:01:14.470> have<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.799> digital

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
together if you don't have the digital

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.649 
together if you don't have the digital
die-cuts<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.759> could<00:01:15.939> certainly<00:01:16.210> use<00:01:16.330> our

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
die-cuts you could certainly use our

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.109 
die-cuts you could certainly use our
frame<00:01:16.930> cuts<00:01:17.259> or<00:01:17.500> our<00:01:17.770> stamp<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.369> die-cut<00:01:18.790> sets

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
frame cuts or our stamp and die-cut sets

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.490 
frame cuts or our stamp and die-cut sets
so<00:01:19.990> also<00:01:20.230> what<00:01:20.500> I've<00:01:20.590> done<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:21.160> I've<00:01:21.400> glued<00:01:22.030> my

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
so also what I've done is I've glued my

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.320 
so also what I've done is I've glued my
flower<00:01:23.500> here<00:01:23.890> just<00:01:24.280> kind<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.580> just<00:01:24.730> use<00:01:25.120> my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
flower here just kind of just use my

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.210 
flower here just kind of just use my
tape<00:01:25.870> runner<00:01:26.110> here<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.620> I<00:01:26.650> put<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:26.950> onto<00:01:27.190> a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
tape runner here and I put it onto a

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.950 
tape runner here and I put it onto a
piece<00:01:27.370> of<00:01:27.430> plastic<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.510> work<00:01:28.690> on<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
piece of plastic so I can work on the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.010 
piece of plastic so I can work on the
plastic<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.740> also<00:01:30.370> have<00:01:30.730> some<00:01:31.090> heavy<00:01:31.690> cardstock

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
plastic I also have some heavy cardstock

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.020 
plastic I also have some heavy cardstock
here<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.830> is<00:01:32.950> actually<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.310> 100<00:01:33.790> pound

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
here and this is actually a 100 pound

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.300 
here and this is actually a 100 pound
cardstock<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.050> I've<00:01:35.530> already<00:01:35.800> run<00:01:36.040> this

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
cardstock and I've already run this

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.190 
cardstock and I've already run this
through<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.940> can<00:01:36.970> see<00:01:37.300> how<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.659> embosses

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
through so you can see how that embosses

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.359 
through so you can see how that embosses
the<00:01:38.380> flower<00:01:38.620> onto<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> cardstock

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.770 

so<00:01:45.369> what<00:01:45.609> I<00:01:45.640> have<00:01:45.909> here<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.329> get<00:01:46.450> my<00:01:46.570> dry

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
so what I have here to get my dry

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.990 
so what I have here to get my dry
embossing<00:01:47.049> going<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.740> my<00:01:47.770> flower<00:01:48.219> on<00:01:48.670> my<00:01:48.820> piece

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
embossing going is my flower on my piece

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.899 
embossing going is my flower on my piece
of<00:01:49.149> plastic<00:01:49.630> eyes<00:01:50.200> also<00:01:50.530> cut<00:01:51.100> apart<00:01:51.579> a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
of plastic eyes also cut apart a

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.850 
of plastic eyes also cut apart a
mousepad<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.960> it's<00:01:53.289> kind<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.649> thin

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
mousepad and it's kind of a thin

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.880 
mousepad and it's kind of a thin
mousepad<00:01:54.399> I'll<00:01:54.670> be<00:01:55.119> using<00:01:55.210> one<00:01:55.630> plate<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
mousepad I'll be using one plate and the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.770 
mousepad I'll be using one plate and the
entire<00:01:57.219> platform<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.090> my<00:01:58.210> Big<00:01:58.360> Shot<00:02:00.780> next

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
entire platform for my Big Shot next

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.499 
entire platform for my Big Shot next
I'll<00:02:01.960> want<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.380> secure<00:02:02.829> my<00:02:03.189> piece<00:02:03.880> of<00:02:04.030> plastic

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
I'll want to secure my piece of plastic

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.169 
I'll want to secure my piece of plastic
and<00:02:04.659> flour<00:02:04.899> onto<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.759> platform<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:06.969> I'm<00:02:07.030> just

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
and flour onto the platform and I'm just

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.050 
and flour onto the platform and I'm just
using<00:02:07.360> some<00:02:07.630> remount<00:02:08.500> Abal<00:02:08.849> painters<00:02:09.849> tape

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
using some remount Abal painters tape

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.729 
using some remount Abal painters tape
and<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.539> is<00:02:10.690> great<00:02:10.959> because<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.470> holds

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
and this is great because it holds

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.410 
and this is great because it holds
things<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.129> place<00:02:12.400> but<00:02:12.730> yet<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.030> peels<00:02:13.239> apart

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
things in place but yet it peels apart

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.600 
things in place but yet it peels apart
really<00:02:13.900> easily<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.400> going<00:02:15.549> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
really easily so I'm just going to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.880 
really easily so I'm just going to
secure<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.209> four<00:02:16.420> corners<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.590> down

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
secure the four corners of this down

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
secure the four corners of this down
onto<00:02:18.190> my<00:02:18.370> platform<00:02:18.760> I'll<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:20.019> working<00:02:20.620> with

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
onto my platform I'll be working with

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.319 
onto my platform I'll be working with
the<00:02:20.920> entire<00:02:21.190> platform<00:02:21.849> through<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.150> whole

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
the entire platform through this whole

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:22.940 
the entire platform through this whole
process

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
process

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.559 
process
even<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.190> my<00:02:24.340> stamping<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.150> this<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.420> just

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
even with my stamping so this is just

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.050 
even with my stamping so this is just
kind<00:02:25.690> of<00:02:25.959> my<00:02:26.170> base<00:02:26.380> for<00:02:26.769> everything<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.880> now<00:02:28.030> I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
kind of my base for everything so now I

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.020 
kind of my base for everything so now I
have<00:02:28.420> my<00:02:29.010> 100-pound<00:02:30.010> cardstock<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.849> could

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
have my 100-pound cardstock you could

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.089 
have my 100-pound cardstock you could
use<00:02:31.209> eighty<00:02:31.480> pound<00:02:31.750> cardstock<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:32.560> even<00:02:32.799> 60

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
use eighty pound cardstock or even 60

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.220 
use eighty pound cardstock or even 60
pound<00:02:33.400> cardstock<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.690> want<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.959> show<00:02:38.170> you

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
pound cardstock and I want to show you

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.860 
pound cardstock and I want to show you
really<00:02:38.530> quick<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.310> mounted<00:02:39.880> my<00:02:39.910> flower<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
really quick that I mounted my flower so

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.470 
really quick that I mounted my flower so
the<00:02:40.989> image<00:02:41.319> sits<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.250> will<00:02:42.400> be<00:02:42.549> stamped<00:02:43.120> if

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
the image sits as it will be stamped if

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.660 
the image sits as it will be stamped if
you<00:02:43.720> reverse<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.799> could<00:02:45.069> actually<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
you reverse it you could actually do a

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.190 
you reverse it you could actually do a
letterpress<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.069> going<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.579> be

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
letterpress but this is going to be

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.550 
letterpress but this is going to be
sitting<00:02:50.200> as<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:51.010> flower<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:52.170> shown<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
sitting as the flower is shown on the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.120 
sitting as the flower is shown on the
block<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:54.190> hope<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.639> makes<00:02:54.819> sense<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:56.769> now<00:02:56.950> I'm

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
block I hope that makes sense so now I'm

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.610 
block I hope that makes sense so now I'm
just<00:02:57.250> creating<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> little<00:02:57.819> hinge<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:59.410> want

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
just creating a little hinge and I want

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.199 
just creating a little hinge and I want
to<00:02:59.709> put<00:02:59.889> this<00:03:00.040> into<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> machine<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:01.090> the

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
to put this into the machine so the

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.319 
to put this into the machine so the
motion<00:03:01.630> goes<00:03:01.810> along<00:03:02.260> with<00:03:02.440> my<00:03:02.680> hinge<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.329> on

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
motion goes along with my hinge and on

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.360 
motion goes along with my hinge and on
top<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:05.079> will<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:05.470> my<00:03:05.620> mouse<00:03:05.829> pad<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.160> this

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
top I will put my mouse pad and this

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.759 
top I will put my mouse pad and this
acts<00:03:06.670> as<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.940> cushion<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.870> everything<00:03:08.590> can

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
acts as a cushion so that everything can

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.710 
acts as a cushion so that everything can
get<00:03:08.920> dry<00:03:09.220> embossed<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:09.910> then<00:03:10.420> I'll<00:03:10.510> put<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
get dry embossed and then I'll put the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.710 
get dry embossed and then I'll put the
one<00:03:10.959> plate<00:03:11.260> on<00:03:11.500> top<00:03:12.180> now<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.209> can<00:03:13.450> run<00:03:13.630> it

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
one plate on top now I can run it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.870 
one plate on top now I can run it
through<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:13.930> machine<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:15.489> goes<00:03:15.700> through

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
through my machine it goes through

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.400 
through my machine it goes through
really<00:03:16.180> easily<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:18.359> now<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.750> show<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.019> how

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
really easily and now I can show you how

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.330 
really easily and now I can show you how
this<00:03:20.980> looks

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this looks

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.819 
this looks
embossed<00:03:22.019> I'll<00:03:23.019> try<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.290> get<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> light

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
embossed I'll try to get it in the light

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.539 
embossed I'll try to get it in the light
there<00:03:24.069> we<00:03:24.160> go

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549

I'll be keeping everything on the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.610 
I'll be keeping everything on the
platform<00:03:27.639> as<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.150> my<00:03:28.389> stamping<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.470> way

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
platform as I do my stamping so that way

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.370 
platform as I do my stamping so that way
the<00:03:30.069> paper<00:03:30.430> behind<00:03:30.940> will<00:03:31.630> keep<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.079> embossed

what we'll do first is I want to show

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.900 
what we'll do first is I want to show
you<00:03:46.030> when<00:03:46.359> you<00:03:46.480> mount<00:03:46.690> your<00:03:46.840> flower<00:03:47.910> since

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
you when you mount your flower since

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120 
you when you mount your flower since
these<00:03:49.090> are<00:03:49.329> kind<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:49.630> movable<00:03:50.169> you<00:03:50.829> want<00:03:51.040> to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
these are kind of movable you want to

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.499 
these are kind of movable you want to
make<00:03:51.280> sure<00:03:51.579> because<00:03:51.940> it's<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.359> digital

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:52.509 
make sure because it's the digital

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.870 
make sure because it's the digital
die-cut<00:03:53.169> and<00:03:53.199> it<00:03:53.500> is<00:03:53.769> made<00:03:54.100> from<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.519> exact

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
die-cut and it is made from the exact

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.480 
die-cut and it is made from the exact
image

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
image

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.670 
image
I<00:03:55.520> like<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:56.030> flop<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.510> down<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.140> then

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
I like to just flop that down and then

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.590 
I like to just flop that down and then
put<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.130> my<00:03:58.250> block<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:58.730> don't<00:03:58.970> want<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.300> stem

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
put it to my block I don't want the stem

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.500 
put it to my block I don't want the stem
to<00:03:59.630> bend<00:04:00.140> by<00:04:00.620> me<00:04:00.920> placing<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.880> stamp<00:04:02.120> onto<00:04:02.360> the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
to bend by me placing the stamp onto the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.740 
to bend by me placing the stamp onto the
block<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.110> flop<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.890> down<00:04:04.070> on<00:04:04.370> your<00:04:04.850> surface

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
block so flop it down on your surface

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.630 
block so flop it down on your surface
and<00:04:05.780> then<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.650> can<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.070> get<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.220> perfect

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
and then you can just get a perfect

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.700 
and then you can just get a perfect
mount<00:04:07.820> every<00:04:08.180> time<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:09.170> I'm<00:04:09.350> just<00:04:09.500> going<00:04:09.650> to

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
mount every time so I'm just going to

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.220
