you've got your three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:01:53.490> output<00:01:54.120> so<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.750> put<00:01:55.350> sound

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
millimeter output so you can put sound

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.149 
millimeter output so you can put sound
out<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.580> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> also<00:01:58.159> your

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
out of it if you want to and also your

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.969 
out of it if you want to and also your
USB<00:01:59.550> here<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.900> you<00:02:01.229> may<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.409> wondering<00:02:01.830> why

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
USB here now you may be wondering why

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
USB here now you may be wondering why
that's<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.400> there<00:02:02.580> it's<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.330> isn't

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that's on there it's because this isn't

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's on there it's because this isn't
only<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:04.170> speaker<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.010> can<00:02:05.250> also<00:02:05.400> act<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.150> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
only a speaker this can also act as a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.009 
only a speaker this can also act as a
backup<00:02:07.440> battery<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.239> it's<00:02:09.239> summer<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.899> want

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
backup battery so it's summer you want

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
you'll see I've got the speaker parked

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.710

I plug that in here it starts to charge

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.809 
I plug that in here it starts to charge
so<00:02:44.260> we've<00:02:44.409> got<00:02:44.590> some<00:02:44.769> music<00:02:44.920> playing<00:02:45.459> through

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
so we've got some music playing through

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.330 
so we've got some music playing through
here<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.440> what's<00:02:47.680> incredible<00:02:47.980> about

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
here now and what's incredible about

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.030 
here now and what's incredible about
this<00:02:48.670> speaker<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.079> even<00:02:50.620> though<00:02:50.739> it's<00:02:50.890> so

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
this speaker is that even though it's so

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.160 
this speaker is that even though it's so
small<00:02:51.459> because<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.450> individually

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
small because of the to individually

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.599 
small because of the to individually
powered<00:02:53.530> speakers<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.069> are<00:02:54.159> in<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.459> with

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
powered speakers that are in there with

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.089 
powered speakers that are in there with
their<00:02:54.760> own<00:02:54.790> subwoofers<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:55.629> amplifiers<00:02:56.099> you

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
their own subwoofers and amplifiers you

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.710 
their own subwoofers and amplifiers you
actually<00:02:57.370> get<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.519> really<00:02:57.909> good<00:02:58.030> sound<00:02:58.329> that<00:02:58.599> if

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
actually get a really good sound that if

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960 
actually get a really good sound that if
you<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:59.440> you're<00:02:59.590> particularly<00:03:00.220> keen<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.489> bass

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
you if you're particularly keen on bass

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.619 
you if you're particularly keen on bass
you<00:03:01.239> get<00:03:01.450> quite<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> decent<00:03:02.440> amount<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.769> bass

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
you get quite a decent amount of bass

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.390 
you get quite a decent amount of bass
with<00:03:04.629> similarly<00:03:05.200> sized<00:03:05.530> speakers<00:03:06.099> that<00:03:06.280> you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
with similarly sized speakers that you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.309 
with similarly sized speakers that you
see<00:03:06.639> elsewhere<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.420> might<00:03:07.690> find<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.170> you

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
see elsewhere you might find that you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.349 
see elsewhere you might find that you
get<00:03:08.470> too<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.829> travel<00:03:09.310> maybe<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.060> little<00:03:10.180> bit

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
get too much travel maybe a little bit

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.119 
get too much travel maybe a little bit
too<00:03:10.510> much<00:03:10.750> mid<00:03:11.049> range<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.500> not<00:03:11.620> enough<00:03:11.859> bass

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
too much mid range and not enough bass

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.710 
too much mid range and not enough bass
and<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.489> just<00:03:12.730> gives<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.060> such<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.359> good

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
and this just gives you such a good

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.379 
and this just gives you such a good
variety<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.680> sound<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:15.790> loud<00:03:16.120> if

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
variety of sound and it's so loud if

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.819 
variety of sound and it's so loud if
I've<00:03:16.510> pumped<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.930> up<00:03:18.659> all<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.840> way<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.260> think

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
I've pumped it up all the way I think

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.970 
I've pumped it up all the way I think
that<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.280> all<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.489> way<00:03:21.579> home

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.059 

and<00:03:25.940> that's<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.330> science<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.900> ghosts<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.530> I

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
and that's the science of ghosts and I

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.940 
and that's the science of ghosts and I
can<00:03:28.220> barely<00:03:28.400> hear<00:03:28.640> myself<00:03:28.819> talking<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:33.739> is

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
can barely hear myself talking that is

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.759 
can barely hear myself talking that is
incredibly<00:03:34.610> loud<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:39.050> ridiculously

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
incredibly loud that is ridiculously

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.620 
incredibly loud that is ridiculously
loud<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:40.489> loud<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.879> hurts<00:03:41.030> my<00:03:41.300> ears

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
loud that is so loud it hurts my ears

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.479 
loud that is so loud it hurts my ears
and<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.590> fact<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.890> it's<00:03:43.069> coming<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.459> of

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
and the fact that it's coming out of

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.460 
and the fact that it's coming out of
such<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> neatly<00:03:44.239> designed<00:03:44.540> package

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
such a neatly designed package

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.009 
such a neatly designed package
it's<00:03:45.590> just<00:03:45.860> incredible<00:03:46.519> hence<00:03:47.330> why<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.660> wanted

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
it's just incredible hence why I wanted

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.960 
it's just incredible hence why I wanted
to<00:03:48.080> make<00:03:48.349> sure<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.739> saw<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.310> I'm<00:03:49.580> gonna<00:03:49.700> turn

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
to make sure you saw this I'm gonna turn

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.720 
to make sure you saw this I'm gonna turn
this<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.330> him<00:03:50.680> it's<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.769> fantastic<00:03:52.430> speaker

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
this to him it's a fantastic speaker

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.210 
this to him it's a fantastic speaker
there<00:03:53.030> normally<00:03:53.590> $119<00:03:54.590> but<00:03:54.830> at<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.069> moment

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
there normally $119 but at the moment

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.809 
there normally $119 but at the moment
