showing you how to play neo in air Mac
the<00:00:04.330> right<00:00:04.540> way<00:00:04.750> so<00:00:05.020> what<00:00:05.410> you<00:00:05.530> need<00:00:05.680> to<00:00:05.800> do

the right way so what you need to do
this<00:00:06.100> this<00:00:06.340> strategy<00:00:06.760> that<00:00:06.880> I'm<00:00:06.970> going<00:00:07.090> to<00:00:07.150> be

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
this this strategy that I'm going to be

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.790 
this this strategy that I'm going to be
showing<00:00:07.390> you<00:00:07.540> are<00:00:07.720> basically<00:00:08.019> just<00:00:08.200> bombs<00:00:08.470> and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
showing you are basically just bombs and

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.830 
showing you are basically just bombs and
the<00:00:08.890> neo<00:00:09.070> mech<00:00:09.340> which<00:00:09.850> has<00:00:10.059> cloaking

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
the neo mech which has cloaking

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.630 
the neo mech which has cloaking
abilities<00:00:11.230> and<00:00:11.470> that's<00:00:11.620> its<00:00:11.800> main<00:00:11.830> thing<00:00:12.220> it

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
abilities and that's its main thing it

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.160 
abilities and that's its main thing it
also<00:00:12.820> has<00:00:13.059> this<00:00:13.180> defense<00:00:13.570> booster<00:00:13.900> but<00:00:14.019> you'll

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
also has this defense booster but you'll

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.480 
also has this defense booster but you'll
only<00:00:14.320> want<00:00:14.500> to<00:00:14.650> get<00:00:14.769> that<00:00:14.920> after<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:15.250> have<00:00:15.370> at

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
only want to get that after you have at

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.100 
only want to get that after you have at
least<00:00:15.580> two<00:00:15.760> points<00:00:16.090> in<00:00:16.179> this<00:00:16.360> because<00:00:16.930> this

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
least two points in this because this

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.570 
least two points in this because this
takes<00:00:17.350> a<00:00:17.470> lot<00:00:17.650> of<00:00:17.680> energy<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.190> you<00:00:18.220> need<00:00:18.460> the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
takes a lot of energy and you need the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.609 
takes a lot of energy and you need the
efficiency<00:00:19.030> boost<00:00:19.150> so<00:00:19.840> we're<00:00:20.199> gonna<00:00:20.320> start<00:00:20.560> by

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
efficiency boost so we're gonna start by

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.400 
efficiency boost so we're gonna start by
building<00:00:20.830> moneymakers<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:23.109> I'm<00:00:23.230> going<00:00:23.350> to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
building moneymakers and I'm going to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.930 
building moneymakers and I'm going to
show<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.619> how<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.520> works

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
show you how it works

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.380 
show you how it works
playing<00:00:25.840> as<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:27.279> there<00:00:27.789> was<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:27.939> new<00:00:28.029> update

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
playing as now there was a new update

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.880 
playing as now there was a new update
released<00:00:28.689> today<00:00:28.840> because<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:29.650> update

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
released today because in the update

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.460 
released today because in the update
previous<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.580> this<00:00:30.699> there<00:00:31.689> was<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:32.019> glitch

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
previous to this there was a glitch

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.139 
previous to this there was a glitch
where<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:32.890> texture<00:00:33.220> for<00:00:33.460> neo<00:00:33.610> 1<00:00:33.880> clerked

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
where the texture for neo 1 clerked

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.060 
where the texture for neo 1 clerked
wouldn't<00:00:34.660> actually<00:00:35.020> show<00:00:35.260> making<00:00:35.980> him

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
wouldn't actually show making him

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.830 
wouldn't actually show making him
basically<00:00:36.430> on<00:00:36.640> see<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:36.910> punk<00:00:37.120> mechanic<00:00:37.540> totally

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
basically on see a punk mechanic totally

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.560 
basically on see a punk mechanic totally
invisible<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.380> unstoppable<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:40.120> was<00:00:40.360> good

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
invisible and unstoppable which was good

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.569 
invisible and unstoppable which was good
that<00:00:41.200> was<00:00:41.320> a<00:00:41.380> good<00:00:41.739> thing<00:00:41.920> for<00:00:42.100> neo<00:00:42.280> players

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
that was a good thing for neo players

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.430 
that was a good thing for neo players
but<00:00:42.910> now<00:00:43.090> that's<00:00:43.300> gone<00:00:43.450> so<00:00:43.899> when<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.200> cloak

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
but now that's gone so when you cloak

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.500 
but now that's gone so when you cloak
you<00:00:44.649> still<00:00:44.920> seem<00:00:45.129> visible<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:46.090> what<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:46.390> need

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
you still seem visible so what you need

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.910 
you still seem visible so what you need
to<00:00:46.629> do<00:00:46.719> basically<00:00:47.020> is<00:00:47.110> earn<00:00:47.350> your<00:00:47.500> first<00:00:47.739> level

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
to do basically is earn your first level

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.650 
to do basically is earn your first level
by<00:00:48.129> capping<00:00:48.520> your<00:00:48.640> posts<00:00:48.969> because<00:00:49.149> see<00:00:49.480> that

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
by capping your posts because see that

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.020 
by capping your posts because see that
experience<00:00:50.140> boost<00:00:50.290> there<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:51.280> happens<00:00:51.760> when

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
experience boost there that happens when

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.840 
experience boost there that happens when
you<00:00:52.149> cap<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:53.649> post<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.399> next<00:00:54.550> one<00:00:54.730> will

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
you cap one post so the next one will

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.560 
you cap one post so the next one will
ever<00:00:55.059> know

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
ever know

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.000 
ever know
with<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.870> I'll<00:00:56.079> get<00:00:56.289> cloak<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.770> then<00:00:56.890> I'll

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
with that I'll get cloak and then I'll

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.640 
with that I'll get cloak and then I'll
start<00:00:57.219> having<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.969> forward<00:00:58.360> post

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
start having a forward post

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.590 
start having a forward post
I'm<00:01:00.130> on<00:01:00.310> the<00:01:00.400> map<00:01:00.550> dual<00:01:00.760> because<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.240> works<00:01:01.420> for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
I'm on the map dual because it works for

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.470 
I'm on the map dual because it works for
this<00:01:01.750> it's<00:01:01.990> a<00:01:02.050> good<00:01:02.200> place<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.440> try<00:01:02.650> out<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
this it's a good place to try out so

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.830 
this it's a good place to try out so
what<00:01:04.630> you<00:01:04.720> do<00:01:04.840> here<00:01:04.870> we<00:01:05.170> go<00:01:05.910> say<00:01:06.910> you<00:01:07.420> get<00:01:07.570> cloak

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
what you do here we go say you get cloak

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.320 
what you do here we go say you get cloak
then<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.950> press<00:01:09.370> right<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.850> corner<00:01:10.150> when

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
then you can press right to corner when

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.550 
then you can press right to corner when
you<00:01:10.480> turn<00:01:10.660> invisible<00:01:10.870> and<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.290> enemy's

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
you turn invisible and the enemy's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.160 
you turn invisible and the enemy's
turret<00:01:11.770> scan<00:01:12.100> not<00:01:12.280> see<00:01:12.520> you<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:13.420> let's<00:01:14.020> see

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
turret scan not see you so let's see

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.550 
turret scan not see you so let's see
here

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560

you capture a forward post what you need
to<00:01:19.420> do<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:20.160> start<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.310> build<00:01:21.520> seekers<00:01:22.330> and

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
to do is start to build seekers and

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.420 
to do is start to build seekers and
other<00:01:22.900> anti-air<00:01:23.590> things<00:01:23.860> so<00:01:24.070> that<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> enemy

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
other anti-air things so that the enemy

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.940 
other anti-air things so that the enemy
has<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.730> hard<00:01:25.120> time<00:01:25.180> recapturing<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> post<00:01:26.350> so

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
has a hard time recapturing the post so

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.050 
has a hard time recapturing the post so
I'm<00:01:27.070> actually<00:01:27.190> gonna<00:01:27.460> do<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.730> one<00:01:27.910> up<00:01:28.030> here

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
I'm actually gonna do this one up here

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.890 
I'm actually gonna do this one up here
because<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.660> know<00:01:28.780> they're<00:01:29.020> not<00:01:29.050> there<00:01:29.350> yet

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
because you know they're not there yet

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.750 
because you know they're not there yet
I'm<00:01:31.900> playing<00:01:32.170> against<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.710> bot<00:01:33.010> so<00:01:33.340> he'll<00:01:33.610> be<00:01:33.640> a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
I'm playing against a bot so he'll be a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.950 
I'm playing against a bot so he'll be a
little<00:01:34.060> harder<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.420> work<00:01:34.450> with<00:01:34.600> here

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
little harder to work with here

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.440 
little harder to work with here
hopefully<00:01:35.770> be<00:01:36.100> appreciating<00:01:36.760> what<00:01:36.790> he's<00:01:37.240> like

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
hopefully be appreciating what he's like

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.469 
hopefully be appreciating what he's like
you<00:01:37.630> know<00:01:37.720> more<00:01:37.960> cooperative

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you know more cooperative

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.570 
you know more cooperative
then<00:01:40.479> he's<00:01:40.630> being<00:01:40.869> right<00:01:41.110> now<00:01:41.340> trying<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.400> hold

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
then he's being right now trying to hold

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.190 
then he's being right now trying to hold
on<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.820> them<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:42.970> it's<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> crazy<00:01:43.900> mother

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
on to them so it's like a crazy mother

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
so those seekers and usually Jonas will

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.680 
so those seekers and usually Jonas will
hold<00:01:47.560> off<00:01:47.710> creeps<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.729> other<00:01:48.970> outpost

because<00:02:11.200> now<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.920> defense<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.970> keep

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120

so<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:24.580> are<00:02:24.610> beeps<00:02:27.120> get<00:02:28.120> these<00:02:28.300> Gemini's

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
so there are beeps get these Gemini's

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.320 
so there are beeps get these Gemini's
moving<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.460> base<00:02:30.670> defense<00:02:31.120> will<00:02:31.300> be

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
moving now my base defense will be

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.910 
moving now my base defense will be
enough<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> hold<00:02:31.930> off<00:02:32.080> any<00:02:32.320> attack<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
enough to hold off any attack that the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.590 
enough to hold off any attack that the
bot<00:02:33.070> makes<00:02:33.310> because<00:02:33.520> BOTS<00:02:33.940> don't<00:02:34.150> seem<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
bot makes because BOTS don't seem to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.240 
bot makes because BOTS don't seem to
take<00:02:34.750> brush<00:02:35.050> or<00:02:35.260> backdoor<00:02:35.710> they<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.100> don't

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
take brush or backdoor they just don't

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280 
take brush or backdoor they just don't
do<00:02:36.370> those<00:02:36.520> things<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.900> gonna<00:02:38.020> be<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
do those things so this is gonna be a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.930 
do those things so this is gonna be a
little<00:02:38.470> easy<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.490> show

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
little easy to show

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.090 
little easy to show
I've<00:02:40.480> used<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> strategy<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.470> PvP<00:02:41.890> games

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
I've used the strategy of in PvP games

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.270 
I've used the strategy of in PvP games
before<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.790> definitely<00:02:42.940> works<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:45.100> cap

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
before so it definitely works so you cap

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.690 
before so it definitely works so you cap
the<00:02:45.460> forward<00:02:45.730> post<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:48.220> kind<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.430> hard<00:02:48.640> to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
the forward post it's kind of hard to

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.180 
the forward post it's kind of hard to
hold<00:02:48.820> posts

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.150 

so<00:02:54.190> just<00:02:54.400> gonna<00:02:54.490> take<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> back<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.950> now<00:02:56.950> it's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
so just gonna take it back and now it's

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.850 
so just gonna take it back and now it's
defended<00:02:57.670> enough<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.240> like<00:02:58.780> creeps<00:02:59.530> and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
defended enough that like creeps and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.110 
defended enough that like creeps and
other<00:03:00.100> things<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.610> enemy<00:03:00.700> might<00:03:00.940> drop

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
other things that the enemy might drop

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.850 
other things that the enemy might drop
off<00:03:01.300> you'll<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.570> able<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.750> get<00:03:01.870> back<00:03:02.020> in<00:03:02.200> so

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
off you'll be able to get back in so

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.800 
off you'll be able to get back in so
what<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> want<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> do<00:03:03.460> now<00:03:03.630> well<00:03:04.630> I'm<00:03:04.690> gonna

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
keep arming up the front defense first

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.520 
keep arming up the front defense first
and<00:03:06.790> then<00:03:06.910> when<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.240> gets<00:03:07.540> time<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.380> when

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and then when it gets time you know when

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.120 
and then when it gets time you know when
the<00:03:08.590> time's<00:03:09.100> right<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.350> will<00:03:11.710> show

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
you so the way this works is you pick up

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.250 
you so the way this works is you pick up
bombs<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.550> make<00:03:15.730> at<00:03:16.030> your<00:03:16.060> bars<00:03:16.540> oh<00:03:16.780> yeah

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
until their defense is significant

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.780 
until their defense is significant
weekend<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.349> significant<00:03:36.349> movement<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.640> at

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
weekend is significant movement and at

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.850 
weekend is significant movement and at
that<00:03:37.940> point<00:03:38.150> they<00:03:38.480> will<00:03:38.690> have<00:03:38.870> no<00:03:39.349> way<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.530> stop

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
that point they will have no way to stop

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.100 
that point they will have no way to stop
you<00:03:40.040> from<00:03:40.220> doing<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.730> which<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.660> bill<00:03:41.900> taking

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
you from doing this which is bill taking

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.870 
you from doing this which is bill taking
a<00:03:42.319> heavy<00:03:42.500> hitting<00:03:42.739> unit<00:03:43.069> like<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> Gemini<00:03:43.700> which

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
a heavy hitting unit like a Gemini which

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.729 
a heavy hitting unit like a Gemini which
is<00:03:44.000> what<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.150> have<00:03:44.330> here<00:03:44.510> going<00:03:45.319> up<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.620> their

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
is what I have here going up to their

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.610 
is what I have here going up to their
base<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.250> pressing<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.269> Y<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.480> drop<00:03:47.959> it<00:03:48.140> off

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
base and pressing the Y to drop it off

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.440 
base and pressing the Y to drop it off
in<00:03:48.830> attack<00:03:49.099> mode<00:03:49.130> if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.790> drop<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.090> right<00:03:50.239> in

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
in attack mode if you drop it right in

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.699 
in attack mode if you drop it right in
front<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.660> their<00:03:50.780> base<00:03:50.930> they'll<00:03:51.230> take<00:03:51.410> double

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
front of their base they'll take double

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.960 
front of their base they'll take double
damage<00:03:52.040> because<00:03:52.310> heating<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.610> front<00:03:52.819> of<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
damage because heating the front of the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.880 
damage because heating the front of the
base<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.390> much<00:03:54.080> more<00:03:54.290> effective<00:03:54.650> than<00:03:54.709> here<00:03:54.860> in

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
base is much more effective than here in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.620 
base is much more effective than here in
the<00:03:55.040> back<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:55.910> what<00:03:56.060> they<00:03:56.180> put<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.480> to

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
the back this is what they put in to

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.790 
the back this is what they put in to
stop<00:03:56.810> people<00:03:56.930> from<00:03:57.110> just<00:03:57.380> straight<00:03:57.530> up<00:03:57.560> back

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
stop people from just straight up back

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.650 
stop people from just straight up back
dooring<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.280> focusing<00:03:58.700> more<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:58.910> holding

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
dooring and focusing more on holding

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.970 
dooring and focusing more on holding
points<00:03:59.989> while<00:04:00.110> they<00:04:00.200> build<00:04:00.319> up<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.530> rush<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.830> win

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
points while they build up a rush to win

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.370 
points while they build up a rush to win
the<00:04:01.069> game<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.580> fair<00:04:01.790> winner<00:04:02.000> so<00:04:02.569> it's<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.290> good

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
the game the fair winner so it's a good

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.840 
the game the fair winner so it's a good
strategy<00:04:03.799> because<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.250> keeps<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.519> heat<00:04:04.610> up<00:04:04.730> on

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
strategy because it keeps the heat up on

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.370 
strategy because it keeps the heat up on
your<00:04:04.970> enemy<00:04:05.209> forces<00:04:05.510> them<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.750> stay<00:04:06.019> back<00:04:06.200> at

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
your enemy forces them to stay back at

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.990 
your enemy forces them to stay back at
their<00:04:06.500> fortress<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:07.010> Aunt<00:04:07.340> work<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.700> defense

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
their fortress to Aunt work on defense

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240 
their fortress to Aunt work on defense
and<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:09.230> also<00:04:09.380> stops<00:04:09.769> them<00:04:09.980> from<00:04:10.010> doing

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
and it also stops them from doing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.610 
and it also stops them from doing
anything<00:04:10.489> crazy<00:04:10.760> like<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.720> know<00:04:11.840> building<00:04:12.530> up

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
anything crazy like you know building up

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.020 
anything crazy like you know building up
their<00:04:12.799> own<00:04:12.860> tank<00:04:13.069> rush<00:04:13.250> because<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.700> fact<00:04:13.880> is

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
their own tank rush because the fact is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.680 
their own tank rush because the fact is
they're<00:04:14.209> spending<00:04:14.420> all<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.660> money

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
they're spending all the money

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.360 
they're spending all the money
rebuilding<00:04:15.260> defense<00:04:15.590> or<00:04:15.799> trying<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.070> bottom

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
rebuilding defense or trying to bottom

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.830 
rebuilding defense or trying to bottom
your<00:04:16.549> tracks

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.310 

so<00:04:20.139> this<00:04:20.799> has<00:04:21.040> been<00:04:21.280> neo<00:04:21.639> strategy<00:04:22.060> guide<00:04:22.320> so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
so this has been neo strategy guide so

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.230 
so this has been neo strategy guide so
I'll<00:04:23.530> show<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.220> aftermath<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.880> using<00:04:25.150> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
I'll show you the aftermath of using the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.730 
I'll show you the aftermath of using the
strategy<00:04:25.600> for<00:04:25.720> long<00:04:25.840> enough<00:04:26.080> grinding<00:04:26.560> on<00:04:26.650> the

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
strategy for long enough grinding on the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.210 
strategy for long enough grinding on the
enemy<00:04:26.949> in<00:04:27.100> just<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.820> moment<00:04:28.650> alright<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:29.949> what<00:04:30.190> I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
enemy in just a moment alright so what I

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.920 
enemy in just a moment alright so what I
have<00:04:30.460> here<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:30.910> an<00:04:31.060> offense<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:31.449> probably

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
have here is an offense that probably

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.689 
have here is an offense that probably
wouldn't<00:04:32.229> cut<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.680> real<00:04:32.800> game<00:04:32.860> but<00:04:33.310> it

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
wouldn't cut it in the real game but it

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.219 
wouldn't cut it in the real game but it
will<00:04:33.880> work<00:04:34.000> on<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.210> bot<00:04:34.449> because<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.870> guess<00:04:35.020> their

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
will work on a bot because I guess their

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.320 
will work on a bot because I guess their
did<00:04:35.440> their<00:04:35.560> defensive<00:04:35.919> capabilities

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.989 

you<00:04:40.599> know<00:04:40.689> tactics<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.709> I've<00:04:42.249> built<00:04:42.699> a<00:04:42.819> bunch

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
you know tactics so I've built a bunch

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.669 
you know tactics so I've built a bunch
of<00:04:43.119> Tanks<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.629> I'm<00:04:43.929> gonna<00:04:44.020> start<00:04:44.349> rushing

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:44.679 
of Tanks and I'm gonna start rushing

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:46.049 
of Tanks and I'm gonna start rushing
them<00:04:44.800> all<00:04:44.889> by<00:04:45.039> picking<00:04:45.369> them<00:04:45.459> up<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.819> pressing

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:46.059 
them all by picking them up and pressing

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.930 
them all by picking them up and pressing
Y<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.389> set<00:04:46.659> them<00:04:46.809> on<00:04:46.899> you

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
Y to set them on you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.460 
Y to set them on you
directly<00:04:49.420> towards<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.840> enemy<00:04:50.020> base<00:04:50.050> and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
directly towards the enemy base and

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.870 
directly towards the enemy base and
shoot<00:04:50.710> at<00:04:50.860> there<00:04:51.100> rather<00:04:51.370> than<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.640> troops

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
shoot at there rather than the troops

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.790 
shoot at there rather than the troops
around<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.390> but<00:04:53.110> they'll<00:04:53.290> shoot<00:04:53.440> at<00:04:53.590> anything

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
around it but they'll shoot at anything

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.070 
around it but they'll shoot at anything
that<00:04:53.980> they<00:04:54.070> pass<00:04:54.280> on<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.580> way<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.360> I'll<00:04:55.870> keep

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
that they pass on the way so I'll keep

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.580 
that they pass on the way so I'll keep
moving<00:04:56.410> these<00:04:56.560> guys<00:04:56.740> are<00:04:58.140> this<00:04:59.140> will<00:04:59.380> abandon

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
moving these guys are this will abandon

moving these guys are this will abandon
the<00:04:59.860> post<00:05:00.100> but<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:00.790> really<00:05:01.030> easy<00:05:01.060> enough

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
the post but this is really easy enough

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.870 
the post but this is really easy enough
to<00:05:01.720> like<00:05:01.840> do<00:05:02.020> over<00:05:02.320> in<00:05:02.410> case<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.710> fail<00:05:02.920> because

to like do over in case you fail because

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.970 
to like do over in case you fail because

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.570 

now<00:05:12.480> I<00:05:12.510> send<00:05:12.900> them<00:05:13.050> in<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.830> they<00:05:14.010> go<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.520> they

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
now I send them in and they go and they

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.620 
now I send them in and they go and they
rampage<00:05:15.090> this<00:05:15.420> works<00:05:15.660> even<00:05:15.900> better<00:05:16.020> with<00:05:16.320> guns

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.240 

in<00:05:21.870> hindsight<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.650> probably<00:05:22.680> should<00:05:23.220> have

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
in hindsight I probably should have

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.330 
in hindsight I probably should have
bought<00:05:23.430> something

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
bought something

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.310 
bought something
blinders<00:05:25.150> are<00:05:25.389> actually<00:05:25.690> really<00:05:25.900> bad<00:05:26.050> when

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
blinders are actually really bad when

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.540 
blinders are actually really bad when
this<00:05:26.440> happens<00:05:26.800> for<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.130> ending<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.400> have

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
this happens for the ending to have

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.610 
this happens for the ending to have
because<00:05:28.510> what

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
because what

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.220 
because what
half<00:05:31.070> damage<00:05:31.520> or<00:05:32.120> actually<00:05:32.480> 80%<00:05:33.050> damage

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
half damage or actually 80% damage

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.690 
half damage or actually 80% damage
-

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
-

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.790 
-
so<00:05:37.450> now<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.660> enemy<00:05:38.050> really<00:05:38.200> has<00:05:38.410> no<00:05:38.620> way<00:05:38.740> to

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
so now the enemy really has no way to

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
so now the enemy really has no way to
stop<00:05:39.070> me<00:05:39.190> from<00:05:39.310> doing<00:05:39.580> this

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
stop me from doing this

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.970 
stop me from doing this
all<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:41.960> have<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.230> do<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.500> blow<00:05:42.680> up<00:05:42.830> all

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
all that I have to do is blow up all

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.230 
all that I have to do is blow up all
over<00:05:43.130> there<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.490> know

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.879 

I<00:05:46.270> will<00:05:46.780> probably<00:05:46.960> get<00:05:47.139> blown<00:05:47.320> up<00:05:47.350> now<00:05:47.560> miss<00:05:47.800> I

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
I will probably get blown up now miss I

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:48.990 
I will probably get blown up now miss I
boogie<00:05:48.190> out<00:05:48.220> so<00:05:48.430> that's<00:05:48.490> what<00:05:48.639> I'm<00:05:48.699> gonna<00:05:48.820> do

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
run back to this post

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.590 
run back to this post
I<00:05:50.289> no<00:05:50.470> longer<00:05:50.560> have<00:05:50.949> it<00:05:51.130> oh<00:05:51.250> well<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:52.509> fine

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
I no longer have it oh well it's fine

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.150 
I no longer have it oh well it's fine
because<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.199> is<00:05:53.320> actually<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> small<00:05:53.710> map<00:05:53.979> so

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
because this is actually a small map so

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.320 
because this is actually a small map so
I<00:05:54.190> can<00:05:54.370> just<00:05:54.550> run<00:05:54.669> right<00:05:54.789> you<00:05:54.910> get<00:05:55.000> Barry<00:05:55.180> back

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
I can just run right you get Barry back

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.969 
I can just run right you get Barry back
across<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.780> mine<00:05:55.930> I<00:05:56.169> still<00:05:56.680> have<00:05:56.800> a<00:05:56.860> nice

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
across to mine I still have a nice

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.230 
across to mine I still have a nice
little<00:05:57.130> force<00:05:57.400> down<00:05:57.550> there<00:05:57.729> and<00:05:57.880> there<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.090> go

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
little force down there and there you go

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.749 
little force down there and there you go
that's<00:05:58.479> what<00:05:58.720> game<00:05:59.050> set<00:05:59.350> set<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.860> match<00:05:59.979> so

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
that's what game set set and match so

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.430 
that's what game set set and match so
that<00:06:01.300> is<00:06:01.419> how<00:06:01.509> to<00:06:01.539> play<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.750> Neo<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.259> use

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
that is how to play the Neo you use

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.620 
that is how to play the Neo you use
bombs<00:06:02.710> to<00:06:03.130> kill<00:06:03.160> dies<00:06:03.490> until<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.449> their

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
bombs to kill dies until and their

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.659 
bombs to kill dies until and their
defense<00:06:04.900> until<00:06:05.199> you<00:06:05.320> can<00:06:05.530> keep<00:06:06.340> you<00:06:06.550> like

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
defense until you can keep you like

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.129 
defense until you can keep you like
basically<00:06:06.940> you<00:06:07.180> keep<00:06:07.449> them<00:06:07.630> on<00:06:07.720> your<00:06:07.840> top<00:06:08.020> on

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
basically you keep them on your top on

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:08.760 
basically you keep them on your top on
their<00:06:08.320> toes

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
their toes

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.670 
their toes
by<00:06:09.610> using<00:06:09.940> bombs<00:06:10.240> and<00:06:10.570> backdoors<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.320> then

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
by using bombs and backdoors and then

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.930 
by using bombs and backdoors and then
you<00:06:11.830> rush<00:06:12.039> once<00:06:12.340> you've<00:06:12.430> built<00:06:12.550> up<00:06:12.699> enough<00:06:12.820> of

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
you rush once you've built up enough of

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.330 
you rush once you've built up enough of
a<00:06:13.030> force<00:06:13.500> so<00:06:14.500> thank<00:06:14.740> you<00:06:14.800> for<00:06:14.949> watching<00:06:15.220> my
