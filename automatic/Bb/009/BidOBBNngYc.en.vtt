00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 the she it or not and their coach's 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 surroundings stayed in the outdoor gym 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.949
 I'm here today to be aware of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.720
 entity that has occurred in the knowledge 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 very important for two reasons: 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.480
 very important is the first and avoids 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.120
 your choices so it will not stay 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 without making your run which is a 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.649
 important asset or I have a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.710
 during which preparations were made 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 for the electoral race in more 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 feels better about which climbs will be more 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 easy everything everything running will get more 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 easy if we do a good warm up 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.699
 because I must have two phases 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.520
 more general heating lamp for your 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.010
 body and other party located there 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 where will the streets warm up 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 and the joints that such 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 prepare specifically for the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 so I have to start with a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:19.650
 very soft looking to make a run 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.759
 run for it, it's gonna be quiet for 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.900
 start can not make some variations 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:32.000
 is the old one the heels behind 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.000
 or he will have a pull up on his knee 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:42.270
 to take some offsets from behind 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.460
 what a tragic rescue will take place but 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.710
 make some movements of the arms and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 legs by heating your whole body 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.829
 rest with some poles cinema and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.530
 that is why we can do it in 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.439
 competitions this year 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.630
 Ok, let's move on to the most 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.649
 Let's work, let's warm up. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.119
 the thighs our twins and all that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.129
 no longer active during the race 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.879
 but who knows how to make the moon full moment 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.930
 very conducive to this is enough 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.030
 worrying always keep the judge 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.420
 aligned with the tip of feet 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.629
 choose the benches behind comes another 32 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.569
 Okay, then you can start the heating. 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:33.480
 locations can also begin with 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.620
 make a rotating movement of the feet 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.620
 very well known 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.120
 I know you find and also the other 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 and destroying us what is good 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.709
 known to the mother who was going to heal the knee 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.620
 but thinks that great tranquility does not 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.660
 it will roll west or doubled up not 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.269
 makes no sense does not make any 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.280
 sense to work on containment 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.700
 knees because the judge does not run the college 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.060
 it's all like this the most important field 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 the water and the other can also do 23 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.450
 lucky because you can say absolutely no 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.510
 there was an important mention in a certain way 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.000
 the newspaper the stretching insulation 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.200
 static and promises musician damon that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.019
 calm down 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.390
 we do the opposite limit dynamics 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.040
 with the movement can start at least 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.060
 three times that the team thinks back 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.459
 two legs 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.840
 I see a screen in the front and then the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 other 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.879
 I try to respect your flexibility and 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.099
 another come and act alone that's enough 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.140
 then you may want to stretch and also 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.500
 pays the coercive tea fourth front 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.569
 on the thigh may be lacking is tragic and do 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.970
 some insistence up and down 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.069
 low will make the place feel 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.829
 Corinthians in itu 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.680
 after the podium was launched and 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:58.409
 your twins can land the heel 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.420
 one hundred percent in that skusa place because 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.620
 us for some drop-offs for more 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.730
 23 hours 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.909
 is enough on the side and after the other 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.849
 we stay here in our long mind and 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.629
 stay in the next video and 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.629
 continue to train
