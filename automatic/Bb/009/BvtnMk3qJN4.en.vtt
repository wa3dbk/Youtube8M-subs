what<00:01:26.189> i<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:26.909> wanted

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
what i really really really wanted

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
what i really really really wanted
because<00:01:27.659> i<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.650> pvp<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
then i have fitted stock which increases

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
then i have fitted stock which increases
your<00:01:31.530> stability<00:01:31.770> heavy<00:01:32.520> payload<00:01:32.970> which

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
your stability heavy payload which

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
your stability heavy payload which
increases<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.689> blast<00:01:34.049> radius<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.770> javelin

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
increases the blast radius and javelin

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
increases the blast radius and javelin
which<00:01:35.579> increases<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.150> velocity<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.530> i

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
which increases the velocity and then i

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.580 
which increases the velocity and then i
have<00:01:37.759> grenadiers<00:01:38.759> now<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.630> opinion<00:01:39.659> these

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
have grenadiers now in my opinion these

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
have grenadiers now in my opinion these
are<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.189> best<00:01:41.490> perks<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> rocket

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
are not the best perks for the rocket

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.120 
are not the best perks for the rocket
launcher<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> didn't<00:01:43.799> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> spend

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
launcher I just didn't want to spend

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
launcher I just didn't want to spend
five<00:01:44.430> billion<00:01:44.880> boat<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> trying<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> get

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
five billion boat just trying to get

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
five billion boat just trying to get
this<00:01:46.049> perfect<00:01:46.649> rocket<00:01:47.130> launcher<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
this perfect rocket launcher but if I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
this perfect rocket launcher but if I
could<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.689> any<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> perks<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.130> my

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
could have any of the perks and get my

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
could have any of the perks and get my
ideal<00:01:50.700> rocket<00:01:51.000> launcher<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.780> would<00:01:52.170> have

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
ideal rocket launcher I would have

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.859 
ideal rocket launcher I would have
tracking<00:01:52.829> which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.729> important<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.509> me<00:01:54.659> just

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
tracking which is important for me just

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
tracking which is important for me just
because<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.140> mostly<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.130> PvP

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
because I mostly want to use it in PvP

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
because I mostly want to use it in PvP
and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.880> find<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.329> if<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.540> use<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> rocket

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
and I find that if I use a rocket

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.910 
and I find that if I use a rocket
launcher<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.799> doesn't<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.520> tracking<00:02:00.090> it's

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
launcher that doesn't have tracking it's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
launcher that doesn't have tracking it's
pretty<00:02:01.920> difficult<00:02:02.189> sometimes<00:02:02.820> when<00:02:03.420> you're

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
pretty difficult sometimes when you're

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.789 
pretty difficult sometimes when you're
playing<00:02:03.750> against<00:02:04.079> people<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.619> how<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
playing against people that know how to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
playing against people that know how to
dodge<00:02:05.100> rockets<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> would<00:02:06.630> either

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
dodge rockets and then I would either

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
dodge rockets and then I would either
want<00:02:07.110> clown<00:02:07.500> cartridge<00:02:08.069> which<00:02:08.369> makes<00:02:08.640> its

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
want clown cartridge which makes its

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.790 
want clown cartridge which makes its
away<00:02:08.970> every<00:02:09.270> time<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.569> reload<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
away every time you reload you have a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.830 
away every time you reload you have a
chance<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.340> granting<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.940> larger<00:02:12.390> magazine

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
chance of granting a larger magazine

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.520 
chance of granting a larger magazine
than<00:02:13.020> usual

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
than usual

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.170 
than usual
which<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.220> for<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.700> launcher

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
which is really good for this launcher

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780 
which is really good for this launcher
because<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> only<00:02:15.690> holds<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.550> tube

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
because it only holds one in the tube

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.449 
because it only holds one in the tube
and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:18.540> I'd<00:02:18.870> either<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.709> or<00:02:19.950> spray

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
and then I'd either want that or spray

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.740 
and then I'd either want that or spray
and<00:02:20.610> play<00:02:20.790> which<00:02:21.060> makes<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.569> where<00:02:21.690> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
and play which makes it to where you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.720 
and play which makes it to where you
reload<00:02:22.319> faster<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.130> mag<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.610> empty

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
reload faster when the mag is empty

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.270 
reload faster when the mag is empty
obviously<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.780> same<00:02:25.020> reason<00:02:25.160> with<00:02:26.160> it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
obviously for the same reason with it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670 
obviously for the same reason with it
only<00:02:26.430> holding<00:02:26.910> one<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.450> i<00:02:27.510> would<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.350> who's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
only holding one or i would want who's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.770 
only holding one or i would want who's
next<00:02:29.130> which<00:02:29.760> makes<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> where<00:02:30.390> when<00:02:30.750> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
next which makes it to where when you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.530 
next which makes it to where when you
get<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> kill<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.040> reload<00:02:32.550> faster<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.330> i<00:02:33.390> would

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
get a kill you reload faster so i would

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.510 
get a kill you reload faster so i would
want<00:02:33.780> those<00:02:34.260> those<00:02:34.590> would<00:02:34.800> be<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.920> best<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
want those those would be the best just

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.820 
want those those would be the best just
because<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.600> situation<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.620> only

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
because the whole situation with only

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.090 
because the whole situation with only
having<00:02:38.160> one<00:02:38.489> rocket<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:40.080> problem<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:40.950> not

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
having one rocket is a problem it's not

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.820 
having one rocket is a problem it's not
a<00:02:41.160> huge<00:02:41.489> gigantic<00:02:42.180> deal<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.230> can't<00:02:43.560> just

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
a huge gigantic deal but you can't just

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.470 
a huge gigantic deal but you can't just
spam<00:02:44.190> your<00:02:44.430> Rockets<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.270> would<00:02:45.450> with

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
spam your Rockets like I would with

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.360 
spam your Rockets like I would with
other<00:02:45.810> launchers<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.860> actually<00:02:47.010> kill

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
other launchers I have to actually kill

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.490 
other launchers I have to actually kill
someone<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.850> run<00:02:47.970> away<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.390> reload<00:02:48.840> which<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
someone and run away and reload which is

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.170 
someone and run away and reload which is
a<00:02:49.530> bit<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> pain<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.370> ass<00:02:50.550> sometimes<00:02:50.580> but

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes but

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.300 
a bit of a pain in the ass sometimes but
it's<00:02:51.390> not<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> huge<00:02:51.750> deal<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.739> if<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.040> could

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it's not a huge deal but if I could

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.100 
it's not a huge deal but if I could
build<00:02:53.580> my<00:02:53.730> perfect<00:02:54.150> rocket<00:02:54.510> launcher<00:02:54.870> for

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
build my perfect rocket launcher for

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.890 
build my perfect rocket launcher for
this<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.739> would<00:02:56.310> choose<00:02:56.550> those<00:02:56.850> perks<00:02:57.330> so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this I would choose those perks so

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.650 
this I would choose those perks so
that's<00:02:58.110> just<00:02:58.230> my<00:02:58.620> idea<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.580> perfect<00:02:59.910> rocket

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that's just my idea of a perfect rocket

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.180 
that's just my idea of a perfect rocket
launcher<00:03:01.019> i<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.350> put<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> link<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
launcher i will put a link in the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.860 
launcher i will put a link in the
description<00:03:02.819> for<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> guys<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.690> check

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
description for you guys to go and check

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.110 
description for you guys to go and check
out<00:03:04.080> which<00:03:04.590> shows<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.860> every<00:03:05.430> single<00:03:05.700> perk

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
out which shows you every single perk

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240 
out which shows you every single perk
every<00:03:06.600> single<00:03:06.959> upgrade<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.069> can

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
every single upgrade that you can

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
every single upgrade that you can
possibly<00:03:08.519> have<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.540> rocket<00:03:09.870> launcher<00:03:10.230> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
possibly have on the rocket launcher so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110 
possibly have on the rocket launcher so
if<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.739> do<00:03:10.920> want<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.160> reforge<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.850> find

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
if you do want to reforge and find

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.059 
if you do want to reforge and find
something<00:03:12.450> different<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.470> vanilla<00:03:13.860> one

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
something different to the vanilla one

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.190 
something different to the vanilla one
that<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.340> get<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:15.090> will<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.360> fully<00:03:15.630> informed

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
that you get you will be fully informed

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.850 
that you get you will be fully informed
as<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.620> all<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.549> your<00:03:17.820> option<00:03:18.450> now<00:03:19.320> moving<00:03:19.560> on

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
as to all of your option now moving on

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.220 
as to all of your option now moving on
to<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> actual<00:03:20.700> review<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.840> rocket

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
to the actual review of this rocket

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.360 
to the actual review of this rocket
launcher<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.190> information

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
launcher because all of this information

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.880 
launcher because all of this information
is<00:03:23.880> completely<00:03:24.450> useless<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.590> just<00:03:25.769> turn

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
is completely useless if I just turn

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.080 
is completely useless if I just turn
around<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.250> say<00:03:26.400> yeah<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.000> rocket

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
around and say yeah so the rocket

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.090 
around and say yeah so the rocket
launcher<00:03:27.510> just<00:03:27.690> says<00:03:27.870> hey<00:03:28.500> why<00:03:28.799> are<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.950> gonna

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
launcher just says hey why are you gonna

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.100 
launcher just says hey why are you gonna
spend<00:03:29.250> glimmer<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.760> both<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.570> something<00:03:31.079> that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
spend glimmer and both on something that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.280 
spend glimmer and both on something that
is<00:03:31.260> just<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.799> ass<00:03:32.040> ass<00:03:32.670> cracker<00:03:33.209> balls<00:03:33.540> why

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
is just like ass ass cracker balls why

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.330 
is just like ass ass cracker balls why
why<00:03:34.500> would<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.739> do<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.829> no<00:03:35.070> one<00:03:35.160> would<00:03:35.250> do

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
why would you do that no one would do

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.150 
why would you do that no one would do
that<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.850> my<00:03:36.660> first<00:03:36.900> experience<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> rocket

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
that so my first experience of a rocket

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.370 
that so my first experience of a rocket
launcher<00:03:38.519> was<00:03:38.670> actually<00:03:39.180> gallo<00:03:39.510> horn<00:03:39.840> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
launcher was actually gallo horn that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.470 
launcher was actually gallo horn that
was<00:03:40.530> my<00:03:40.650> first<00:03:40.860> one<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.519> gala<00:03:42.209> horn

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
was my first one just because gala horn

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.060 
was my first one just because gala horn

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
need any more but that was my first

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.880 
need any more but that was my first
experience<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.630> lot<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.870> rocket<00:03:58.530> launchers

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
experience so a lot of rocket launchers

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.400 
experience so a lot of rocket launchers
in<00:03:59.070> comparison<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.910> gala<00:04:00.120> horn<00:04:00.359> kind<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.230> suck

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
in comparison to gala horn kind of suck

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
in comparison to gala horn kind of suck
but<00:04:02.250> luckily<00:04:02.489> I've<00:04:02.820> had<00:04:03.030> experience<00:04:03.570> with

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
but luckily I've had experience with

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.229 
but luckily I've had experience with
hunger<00:04:04.109> krona<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.709> Vanguard<00:04:05.519> ones<00:04:05.730> inclusive

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
hunger krona and Vanguard ones inclusive

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.910 
hunger krona and Vanguard ones inclusive
alone'<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.750> now<00:04:06.900> i<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.650> better

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
alone' so now i do have a better

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.970 
alone' so now i do have a better
understanding<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:09.180> rocket<00:04:10.140> launchers<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.859> i

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
understanding of rocket launchers and i

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.920 
understanding of rocket launchers and i
was<00:04:11.130> actually<00:04:11.340> pretty<00:04:12.000> impressed<00:04:12.600> with<00:04:12.720> this

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
was actually pretty impressed with this

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.660 
was actually pretty impressed with this
rocket<00:04:13.320> launcher<00:04:13.680> i<00:04:13.859> think<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> best<00:04:14.609> thing

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
rocket launcher i think the best thing

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.699 
rocket launcher i think the best thing
for<00:04:14.790> me<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.000> compare<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.810> hunger<00:04:16.530> of

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
for me to compare it to is hunger of

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.469 
for me to compare it to is hunger of
crota<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.579> cuz<00:04:17.700> they<00:04:17.820> both<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.180> tracking

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
crota just cuz they both have tracking

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.420 
crota just cuz they both have tracking
that's<00:04:19.200> probably<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.590> really<00:04:20.070> bad<00:04:20.220> i'm

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
that's probably like really bad i'm

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.860 
that's probably like really bad i'm
comparing<00:04:20.789> them<00:04:21.060> because<00:04:21.329> they<00:04:21.479> both<00:04:21.630> have

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
comparing them because they both have

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.750 
comparing them because they both have
tracking<00:04:22.200> but<00:04:22.830> all<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.159> the<00:04:23.220> other<00:04:23.400> rocket

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
tracking but all of the other rocket

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.920 
tracking but all of the other rocket
launches<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.120> I've<00:04:24.330> had<00:04:24.539> that<00:04:24.810> are

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
launches that I've had that are

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.379 
launches that I've had that are
legendary

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
legendary

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.480 
legendary
I do<00:04:25.509> not<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:26.080> tracking<00:04:26.409> so<00:04:27.069> it's<00:04:27.189> the<00:04:27.310> best

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
I do not have tracking so it's the best

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.489 
I do not have tracking so it's the best
one<00:04:27.699> for<00:04:27.729> me<00:04:27.939> to<00:04:28.030> compare<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.449> to<00:04:28.539> and<00:04:28.900> what<00:04:29.469> I

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:29.499 
one for me to compare it to and what I

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.350 
one for me to compare it to and what I
found<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:29.979> hunger<00:04:30.340> of<00:04:30.460> crota<00:04:30.759> a<00:04:30.969> lot<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.270> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
found with hunger of crota a lot of the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.320 
found with hunger of crota a lot of the
time<00:04:31.569> is<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:32.620> sort<00:04:33.099> of<00:04:33.310> tracked<00:04:33.729> people

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
time is that it's sort of tracked people

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.230 
time is that it's sort of tracked people
and<00:04:34.659> it<00:04:34.960> would<00:04:35.110> explode<00:04:35.949> sort<00:04:36.520> of<00:04:36.729> near<00:04:36.969> them

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
and it would explode sort of near them

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.929 
and it would explode sort of near them
but<00:04:37.749> a<00:04:37.779> lot<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.319> time<00:04:38.529> it<00:04:38.770> wouldn't<00:04:39.129> kill

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
but a lot of the time it wouldn't kill

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.969 
but a lot of the time it wouldn't kill
them<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.389> very<00:04:40.569> easy<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.110> dodge<00:04:41.439> rocket

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
them it's very easy to dodge rocket

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.230 
them it's very easy to dodge rocket
launchers<00:04:42.400> when<00:04:42.639> you're<00:04:42.789> in<00:04:42.909> the<00:04:43.029> crucible

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
launchers when you're in the crucible

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.839 
launchers when you're in the crucible
and<00:04:43.689> hunger<00:04:44.349> crota<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.949> would<00:04:45.279> sometimes<00:04:45.729> have

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
and hunger crota I would sometimes have

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.119 
and hunger crota I would sometimes have
three<00:04:46.300> rockets<00:04:46.719> and<00:04:46.960> shoot<00:04:47.259> it<00:04:47.409> and<00:04:47.590> none<00:04:48.099> of

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
three rockets and shoot it and none of

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.860 
three rockets and shoot it and none of
them<00:04:48.400> would<00:04:48.580> kill<00:04:48.819> anyone<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:49.629> might

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
them would kill anyone and that might

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.200 
them would kill anyone and that might
just<00:04:50.020> be<00:04:50.110> because<00:04:50.229> i<00:04:50.529> suck<00:04:50.680> but<00:04:51.520> i<00:04:51.550> don't<00:04:51.849> tend

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
just be because i suck but i don't tend

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.420 
just be because i suck but i don't tend
to<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.539> that<00:04:52.569> issue<00:04:52.990> with<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.979> rocket

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
to have that issue with this rocket

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.040 
to have that issue with this rocket
launcher<00:04:54.699> of<00:04:54.819> course<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.180> happens<00:04:55.479> sometimes

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
launcher of course it happens sometimes

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.600 
launcher of course it happens sometimes
you're<00:04:56.560> gonna<00:04:56.680> have<00:04:56.889> some<00:04:57.099> moments<00:04:57.430> where<00:04:57.520> you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
you're gonna have some moments where you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.879 
you're gonna have some moments where you
like<00:04:57.759> what<00:04:58.539> are<00:04:58.659> you<00:04:58.779> doing<00:04:59.409> where<00:04:59.770> you're

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
like what are you doing where you're

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.769 
like what are you doing where you're
tracking<00:05:00.279> just<00:05:00.759> go<00:05:00.909> so<00:05:00.969> I'm<00:05:01.300> gonna<00:05:01.509> get<00:05:01.719> you

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:01.779 
tracking just go so I'm gonna get you

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:02.730 
tracking just go so I'm gonna get you
I'm<00:05:01.840> gonna<00:05:01.900> get<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.169> I'm<00:05:02.229> gonna<00:05:02.319> get<00:05:02.529> you<00:05:02.620> and

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you and

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.010 
I'm gonna get you I'm gonna get you and
then<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.009> just<00:05:03.159> flies<00:05:03.490> off<00:05:03.550> into<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:04.389> moon<00:05:04.779> or

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
then it just flies off into the moon or

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.839 
then it just flies off into the moon or
something<00:05:05.289> but<00:05:06.069> you<00:05:06.279> will<00:05:06.460> have<00:05:06.610> those

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
something but you will have those

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.369 
something but you will have those
moments<00:05:07.029> but<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.539> find<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.930> those<00:05:08.110> moments

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
moments but I find that those moments

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.679 
moments but I find that those moments
happen<00:05:08.889> a<00:05:09.039> lot<00:05:09.279> less<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.029> I<00:05:10.300> think<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.569> that

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
happen a lot less and I think that that

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.779 
happen a lot less and I think that that
is<00:05:10.900> down<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.439> the<00:05:11.590> blast<00:05:12.009> radius<00:05:12.189> of<00:05:12.669> the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
is down to the blast radius of the

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.179 
is down to the blast radius of the
rocket<00:05:13.120> launcher<00:05:13.449> it<00:05:13.599> has<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:14.229> has<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.949> most

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:15.189 
rocket launcher it has it has the most

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.159 
rocket launcher it has it has the most
blast<00:05:15.460> radius<00:05:15.699> you<00:05:16.240> can't<00:05:16.479> get<00:05:16.629> any<00:05:16.900> more

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
blast radius you can't get any more

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.619 
blast radius you can't get any more
blast<00:05:17.500> radius<00:05:17.770> II<00:05:18.099> than<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.759> bladder<00:05:19.089> radius

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
blast radius II than this bladder radius

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.869 
blast radius II than this bladder radius
so<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.439> think<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.770> even<00:05:21.069> if<00:05:21.279> it<00:05:21.430> explodes

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
so I think that even if it explodes

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.670 
so I think that even if it explodes
somewhat<00:05:22.300> near<00:05:22.479> them<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.689> doesn't<00:05:23.229> directly

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
somewhat near them and doesn't directly

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.670 
somewhat near them and doesn't directly
impact<00:05:24.310> them<00:05:24.699> it<00:05:24.969> will<00:05:25.539> actually<00:05:25.839> kill<00:05:26.469> them

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
impact them it will actually kill them

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.379 
impact them it will actually kill them
because<00:05:26.949> the<00:05:27.039> blast<00:05:27.249> radius<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.669> so<00:05:27.969> freaking

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
because the blast radius is so freaking

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.659 
because the blast radius is so freaking
big<00:05:28.629> now<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.199> major<00:05:29.529> downfall<00:05:30.129> of<00:05:30.400> this

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
big now the major downfall of this

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.279 
big now the major downfall of this
rocket<00:05:31.060> launcher<00:05:31.389> is<00:05:31.569> that<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:31.839> does<00:05:32.050> only

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
rocket launcher is that it does only

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.860 
rocket launcher is that it does only
have<00:05:32.620> one<00:05:32.979> rocket<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:34.089> tube<00:05:34.300> one<00:05:34.599> shell

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
have one rocket in the tube one shell

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.230 
have one rocket in the tube one shell
whatever<00:05:35.319> it's<00:05:35.469> called<00:05:35.650> it<00:05:35.860> only<00:05:36.009> has<00:05:36.279> one<00:05:36.729> so

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
whatever it's called it only has one so

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.179 
whatever it's called it only has one so
after<00:05:37.479> you<00:05:37.569> shoot<00:05:37.810> your<00:05:38.139> first<00:05:38.469> rocket<00:05:38.949> you

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
after you shoot your first rocket you

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.100 
after you shoot your first rocket you
have<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.639> reload<00:05:40.089> so<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.389> can't<00:05:40.629> just<00:05:40.810> run<00:05:40.990> in

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
have to reload so you can't just run in

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.809 
have to reload so you can't just run in
there<00:05:41.139> you<00:05:41.379> like<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.740> got<00:05:41.949> rockets<00:05:42.399> for<00:05:42.580> days

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
there you like I got rockets for days

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.579 
there you like I got rockets for days
and<00:05:43.210> just<00:05:43.599> start<00:05:43.750> spamming<00:05:44.050> them<00:05:44.319> at<00:05:44.469> people

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
and just start spamming them at people

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.040 
and just start spamming them at people
because<00:05:45.219> you<00:05:45.490> need<00:05:45.669> to<00:05:45.789> reload<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.539> rocket

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
because you need to reload the rocket

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.170 
because you need to reload the rocket
launcher<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:47.919> you<00:05:47.979> do<00:05:48.159> have<00:05:48.279> to<00:05:48.460> be<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.819> little

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
launcher so you do have to be a little

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.209 
launcher so you do have to be a little
bit<00:05:49.360> more<00:05:49.509> reserved<00:05:49.870> kill<00:05:50.229> someone<00:05:50.649> step<00:05:50.949> back

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
bit more reserved kill someone step back

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.639 
bit more reserved kill someone step back
reload<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:51.969> go<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.210> do<00:05:52.330> it<00:05:52.360> again<00:05:52.719> but<00:05:53.319> it's

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:53.649 
reload and go and do it again but it's

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:55.889 
reload and go and do it again but it's
kind<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.610> doubtful<00:05:55.029> and<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.449> can<00:05:55.689> have

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:55.899 
kind of a doubtful and you can have

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.629 
kind of a doubtful and you can have
perks<00:05:56.199> that<00:05:56.439> definitely<00:05:56.979> make<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:57.279> a<00:05:57.460> lot

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
perks that definitely make it a lot

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.480 
perks that definitely make it a lot
better<00:05:57.669> which<00:05:58.089> is<00:05:58.240> why<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.419> urge<00:05:58.719> people<00:05:59.050> to

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
better which is why I urge people to

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.559 
better which is why I urge people to
reforge<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.729> try<00:06:00.909> and<00:06:01.000> get<00:06:01.120> those<00:06:01.270> clown

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
reforge to try and get those clown

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.420 
reforge to try and get those clown
cartridges<00:06:02.169> and<00:06:02.379> the<00:06:02.469> spray<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:02.949> play<00:06:03.159> and

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
cartridges and the spray and play and

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.860 
cartridges and the spray and play and
who's<00:06:03.669> next<00:06:03.879> and<00:06:04.210> stuff<00:06:04.389> like<00:06:04.539> that<00:06:04.599> because

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
who's next and stuff like that because

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.929 
who's next and stuff like that because
it<00:06:04.960> will<00:06:05.169> really<00:06:05.349> help<00:06:05.469> but<00:06:06.339> I<00:06:06.370> don't<00:06:06.699> have

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:06.939 
it will really help but I don't have

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.019 
it will really help but I don't have
that<00:06:06.969> and<00:06:07.479> honestly<00:06:08.229> it's<00:06:08.649> not<00:06:09.129> that<00:06:09.189> big<00:06:09.759> of<00:06:09.819> a

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
that and honestly it's not that big of a

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.879 
that and honestly it's not that big of a
deal<00:06:10.210> it's<00:06:10.479> really<00:06:10.810> not<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:11.169> still<00:06:11.529> think<00:06:11.800> that

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:11.889 
deal it's really not I still think that

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.709 
deal it's really not I still think that
the<00:06:12.669> way<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.149> rocket<00:06:13.419> launcher

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
the way that the rocket launcher

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.519 
the way that the rocket launcher
performs<00:06:14.349> can<00:06:15.279> completely<00:06:16.229> outdo<00:06:17.229> the<00:06:17.500> fact

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
performs can completely outdo the fact

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.070 
performs can completely outdo the fact
that<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:18.039> only<00:06:18.219> have<00:06:18.520> one<00:06:18.879> rocket<00:06:19.599> another

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
that you only have one rocket another

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.659 
that you only have one rocket another
thing<00:06:20.319> that<00:06:20.349> I<00:06:20.529> really<00:06:20.860> like<00:06:21.219> about<00:06:21.250> this

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
thing that I really like about this

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.309 
thing that I really like about this
rocket<00:06:22.000> launcher<00:06:22.300> comparing<00:06:22.750> to<00:06:22.870> hunger<00:06:23.169> of

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
rocket launcher comparing to hunger of

porn it lets you hold seven at a time so
I<00:06:43.210> really<00:06:43.539> like<00:06:43.690> that<00:06:43.720> when<00:06:44.289> you<00:06:44.349> go<00:06:44.470> into<00:06:44.590> the

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
I really like that when you go into the

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.230 
I really like that when you go into the
crucible<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.340> you<00:06:45.400> pick<00:06:45.550> up<00:06:45.699> heavy<00:06:45.849> ammo<00:06:46.180> you

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
crucible and you pick up heavy ammo you

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.110 
crucible and you pick up heavy ammo you
get<00:06:46.479> four<00:06:46.870> rockets<00:06:47.380> instead<00:06:47.830> of<00:06:47.860> three<00:06:48.460> which

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
get four rockets instead of three which

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.240 
get four rockets instead of three which
I<00:06:49.270> really<00:06:49.569> like<00:06:49.840> so<00:06:50.080> all<00:06:50.259> in<00:06:50.440> all<00:06:50.560> I<00:06:50.620> think<00:06:50.949> it's

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
I really like so all in all I think it's

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.040 
I really like so all in all I think it's
a<00:06:51.340> really<00:06:51.370> solid<00:06:52.060> rocket<00:06:52.690> launcher

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
a really solid rocket launcher

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.450 
a really solid rocket launcher
especially<00:06:53.560> as<00:06:53.650> you're<00:06:53.770> basically<00:06:54.250> getting

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
especially as you're basically getting

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.980 
especially as you're basically getting
it<00:06:54.669> for<00:06:54.789> free<00:06:54.849> I<00:06:55.150> know<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.479> have<00:06:55.690> to<00:06:55.810> pay

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
it for free I know you have to pay

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.379 
it for free I know you have to pay
glitter<00:06:56.319> which<00:06:56.860> is<00:06:57.009> the<00:06:57.099> opposite<00:06:57.580> of<00:06:57.699> getting

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
glitter which is the opposite of getting

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.540 
glitter which is the opposite of getting
it<00:06:58.539> for<00:06:58.720> free<00:06:58.780> but<00:06:59.560> you<00:06:59.710> don't<00:06:59.919> have<00:07:00.130> to<00:07:00.190> like

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
it for free but you don't have to like

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.820 
it for free but you don't have to like
grind<00:07:00.910> for<00:07:01.300> it<00:07:01.509> really<00:07:01.750> okay<00:07:02.319> you<00:07:02.380> have<00:07:02.560> to<00:07:02.710> get

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
grind for it really okay you have to get

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.159 
grind for it really okay you have to get
to<00:07:02.979> rank<00:07:03.160> for<00:07:03.220> but<00:07:03.910> ok<00:07:04.120> everything<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.139> just

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
to rank for but ok everything I just

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.260 
to rank for but ok everything I just
said<00:07:05.349> makes<00:07:05.620> no<00:07:05.740> sense<00:07:06.250> I<00:07:06.430> just<00:07:06.819> really<00:07:07.090> like

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
said makes no sense I just really like

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.719 
said makes no sense I just really like
the<00:07:07.419> rocket<00:07:07.720> launcher<00:07:08.080> okay<00:07:08.410> I<00:07:08.620> just<00:07:09.099> like<00:07:09.490> it

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
the rocket launcher okay I just like it

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.779 
the rocket launcher okay I just like it
and<00:07:09.940> it's<00:07:10.300> now<00:07:10.509> my<00:07:10.810> go-to<00:07:11.370> when<00:07:12.370> i'm<00:07:12.460> using<00:07:12.729> a

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
and it's now my go-to when i'm using a

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.670 
and it's now my go-to when i'm using a
legendary<00:07:13.180> launcher<00:07:13.539> in<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:13.780> crucible<00:07:14.259> so<00:07:14.650> i

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
legendary launcher in the crucible so i

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.020 
legendary launcher in the crucible so i
would<00:07:14.889> definitely<00:07:14.919> recommend<00:07:15.340> that<00:07:15.759> you<00:07:15.880> pick

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
would definitely recommend that you pick

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.790 
would definitely recommend that you pick
it<00:07:16.180> up<00:07:16.240> you<00:07:16.300> might<00:07:16.570> as<00:07:16.750> well<00:07:16.960> go<00:07:17.229> grind<00:07:17.560> some

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
it up you might as well go grind some

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.740 
it up you might as well go grind some
glimmer<00:07:18.099> go<00:07:18.729> pick<00:07:18.970> it<00:07:19.000> up<00:07:19.210> if<00:07:19.419> you<00:07:19.509> want<00:07:19.690> to

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750 
glimmer go pick it up if you want to

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.689 
glimmer go pick it up if you want to
reforge<00:07:20.110> it<00:07:20.289> go<00:07:20.830> ahead<00:07:21.099> and<00:07:21.280> do<00:07:21.340> it<00:07:21.460> cuz<00:07:21.610> i

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699 
reforge it go ahead and do it cuz i

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.520 
reforge it go ahead and do it cuz i
think<00:07:21.910> it's<00:07:22.060> definitely<00:07:22.599> worth<00:07:22.840> it<00:07:23.050> but

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
think it's definitely worth it but

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.320 
think it's definitely worth it but
honestly<00:07:23.889> i<00:07:23.979> think<00:07:24.130> that<00:07:24.550> because<00:07:24.910> the<00:07:25.090> blast

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
honestly i think that because the blast

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.360 
honestly i think that because the blast
radius<00:07:25.479> is<00:07:25.870> so<00:07:25.990> freaking<00:07:26.320> big<00:07:26.530> even<00:07:27.190> if<00:07:27.280> you

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370 
radius is so freaking big even if you

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.279 
radius is so freaking big even if you
don't<00:07:27.550> have<00:07:27.699> tracking<00:07:28.030> on<00:07:28.419> it<00:07:28.659> and<00:07:28.870> stuff<00:07:29.050> like

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289 
don't have tracking on it and stuff like

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:30.990 
don't have tracking on it and stuff like
that<00:07:29.349> you<00:07:29.740> will<00:07:29.919> still<00:07:30.250> find<00:07:30.280> it<00:07:30.669> pretty

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 
that you will still find it pretty

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.659 
that you will still find it pretty
useful<00:07:31.330> especially<00:07:31.659> as<00:07:32.259> the<00:07:32.770> vanilla<00:07:33.250> rocket

00:07:33.659 --> 00:07:33.669 
useful especially as the vanilla rocket

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:35.820 
useful especially as the vanilla rocket
launcher<00:07:33.940> that<00:07:34.060> you<00:07:34.210> get<00:07:34.419> has<00:07:35.050> the<00:07:35.409> ability<00:07:35.800> to

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
launcher that you get has the ability to

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.860 
launcher that you get has the ability to
hold<00:07:36.069> three<00:07:36.280> rockets<00:07:36.789> so<00:07:37.300> you<00:07:37.360> might<00:07:37.569> not<00:07:37.720> have

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
hold three rockets so you might not have

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.570 
hold three rockets so you might not have
tracking<00:07:38.199> that<00:07:38.560> you<00:07:38.650> can<00:07:38.800> hold<00:07:38.919> three<00:07:39.159> rockets

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580 
tracking that you can hold three rockets

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.710 
tracking that you can hold three rockets
so<00:07:39.669> if<00:07:39.759> you<00:07:39.820> don't<00:07:40.000> kill<00:07:40.180> someone<00:07:40.479> the<00:07:40.599> first

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 
so if you don't kill someone the first

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.480 
so if you don't kill someone the first
I've<00:07:40.960> you<00:07:41.080> can<00:07:41.229> just<00:07:41.380> spam<00:07:41.650> markets<00:07:42.159> at<00:07:42.310> them
