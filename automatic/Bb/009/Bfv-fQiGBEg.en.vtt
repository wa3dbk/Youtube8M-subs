that this is nice and fluffy this the

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.890 
that this is nice and fluffy this the
balla<00:01:17.280> burrito<00:01:17.670> worsted<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.260> malla<00:01:19.710> burrito

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
balla burrito worsted the malla burrito

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.060 
balla burrito worsted the malla burrito
Rios<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.350> nice<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.750> well<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> tight<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
Rios is nice and well and tight then the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.400 
Rios is nice and well and tight then the
Sookie<00:01:26.430> merino<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> Zuma<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.050> third

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
Sookie merino is a Zuma is a third

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.670 
Sookie merino is a Zuma is a third
different<00:01:28.830> texture<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.170> it's<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> combination

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
different texture so it's a combination

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.160 
different texture so it's a combination
of<00:01:32.280> different<00:01:33.060> textures<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.780> different

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
of different textures and different

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.219 
of different textures and different
colors<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:37.130> babri<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.450> worsted<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.570> 210

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
colors now the babri go worsted is 210

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.109 
colors now the babri go worsted is 210
yards<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:41.210> Rios<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> 210<00:01:43.020> yards<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
yards the Rios is 210 yards and the

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.540 
yards the Rios is 210 yards and the
soaking<00:01:45.119> merino<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> 150<00:01:46.170> yards<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.190> this<00:01:47.370> is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
soaking merino is 150 yards so this is

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.940 
soaking merino is 150 yards so this is
going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.760> be<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.390> yarn<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> runs<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.530> first

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
going to be the yarn that runs out first

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
going to be the yarn that runs out first
so<00:01:51.200> because<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.370> with<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.720> least

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so because it's the one with the least

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.110 
so because it's the one with the least
amount<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.590> yardage<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> that's

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
amount of yardage it's the one that's

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.370 
amount of yardage it's the one that's
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> determine<00:01:57.780> how<00:01:58.080> long<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:59.090> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
going to determine how long the the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.550 
going to determine how long the the
scarf<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> home<00:02:04.350> altogether

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
scarf is so I'm going to home altogether

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.259 
scarf is so I'm going to home altogether
and<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.830> gonna<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.220> about<00:02:08.489> here<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> I'm

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
and I'm gonna go about here and I'm

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.320 
and I'm gonna go about here and I'm
gonna<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.750> another<00:02:10.610> I'm<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.910> do<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> slip

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
gonna do another I'm going to do a slip

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.720 
gonna do another I'm going to do a slip
net<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.810> time<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:15.830> put<00:02:16.830> my<00:02:17.010> yarn<00:02:17.250> through

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
net this time and put my yarn through

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.090 
net this time and put my yarn through
and<00:02:19.130> I'm<00:02:20.130> gonna<00:02:20.519> do<00:02:20.820> a<00:02:20.850> cast<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.380> ten<00:02:23.070> I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and I'm gonna do a cast on of ten I

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.340 
and I'm gonna do a cast on of ten I
think<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.030> that'll<00:02:24.330> make<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> very<00:02:25.080> long

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
think and that'll make for a very long

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:36.449 
think and that'll make for a very long
nice<00:02:26.010> long<00:02:26.250> scarf<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.970> there's<00:02:27.299> one<00:02:29.540> two<00:02:32.870> three

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:53.140 

four<00:02:40.890> five<00:02:41.890> six

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:08.800 

seven<00:02:55.879> eight<00:02:59.989> nine<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:04.069> ten

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.300 

so<00:03:10.330> now<00:03:11.330> we<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.410> start<00:03:12.709> knitting<00:03:13.520> it<00:03:15.310> holding

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
so now we just start knitting it holding

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:30.910 
so now we just start knitting it holding
all<00:03:16.490> three<00:03:16.819> strands<00:03:17.180> together

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.250 

making<00:03:31.670> sure<00:03:31.700> not<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:33.670> split<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.970> three<00:03:35.000> as<00:03:35.780> I

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
making sure not to split the three as I

00:03:36.260 --> 00:04:33.780 
making sure not to split the three as I
put<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> needle<00:03:36.800> through

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:42.270 

okay<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.380> turn<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.040> work<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:41.160> do<00:04:42.160> it

almost out of the yarn it is the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.159 
almost out of the yarn it is the
smallest<00:06:17.889> amount<00:06:18.220> of<00:06:18.370> yardage<00:06:18.840> do<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:19.960> bind

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169
