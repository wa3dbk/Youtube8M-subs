00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.210
 compare two action cameras the sj 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.030
 4000 compared to the new low cost model of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 go pro in the case of the sj 4000 there are 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.309
 two versions the one that has wifi and the one that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.420
 do not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 in both cases everything is the same 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.680
 characteristics and recording quality 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 the only difference is the wifi in the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 Chinese store band good we have the model 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.400
 with wifi for about 80 euros and the model 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 that does not have wifi costs about 65 euros 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 there is also the possibility of buying 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.340
 the model without wifi in amazon with 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 effective guarantee in Spain for about 90 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.530
 euros and on the other hand is the new go 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.750
 pro hero that costs 125 euros in amazon 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.250
 All links to these stores are os 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 I leave the video description in case 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 you are interested in buying some of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 the cameras I will briefly describe 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 the characteristics of each camera 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.520
 we started with the sj 4000 records 1080 to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 30 frames per second and 720p to 60 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 frames per second doubling frames 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.059
 has 15 inch screen 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.770
 900 milliampere removable battery 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 that gives it an autonomy of about 100 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 minutes the water casing with which 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.180
 it comes allows us to immerse ourselves until about 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 30 meters hdmi connection and accessories 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.240
 compatible with go 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.950
 now we go with the new go pro is capable 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 to record at 1080 to 30 frames per second 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.409
 and at 720p at 60 frames per second real 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.210
 battery and water housing integrated in 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.700
 the camera without the possibility of extracting 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.159
 The water casing allows to submerge 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.479
 up to 40 meters and your battery gives you 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.880
 an autonomy of about two and a half hours 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.430
 now we are going with the comparison of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 videos that record these two cameras for 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.270
 this first test of the position of both 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.119
 cameras to record at 1080p at 30 frames per 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.130
 second in the case of the 4000 sj I've 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.990
 left all the default settings I 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.990
 I mean exposure white balance 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.880
 and hdr off these options do not 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.220
 can modify the pro side so 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.409
 more possibilities do not support 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.420
 tests in the case of the sj 4000 I've 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.069
 done with the wi-fi version but as already 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.840
 I said before the image quality is 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.880
 the same in this model as in the one that does not 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.619
 has wifi for these conditions 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.450
 the two cameras obtain 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.860
 very similar results and in both 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.959
 pretty good 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.390
 pretty real colors and an exhibition 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.610
 correct but if you look at the sky 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.470
 the sj 4000 adjusts the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.260
 exposure and does not burn the sky so much 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.090
 as the go pro turn 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.040
 by my hands have already passed 2 go pro 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.439
 this model that we are analyzing now 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.730
 the lake pro giro 3 white was the version 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.220
 cheaper than there were until they have 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 come out these new models compared 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 with this model is proven improved 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290
 quite in image quality and in addition 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.959
 of that its price has dropped 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.510
 substantially since I make produce 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.620
 or 3 white cost more than 200 euros and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 this new version is at 125 euros 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 This book pro has been launched for 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.890
 try to gain ground to the low cameras 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.780
 cost of action that are proliferating 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.459
 in my point of view the one that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.359
 impact and sale is being removed to go 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.760
 pro is the sj 4000 other data that for 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.470
 some may be interesting and that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.450
 sometimes you ask me in other 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.859
 reviews of other cameras is about the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.859
 format in which the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.170
 videos in the case of the cj 4000 is done 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.709
 in point mode and for the case of the go 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.239
 pro is stored in mp4 point this video 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.950
 that you are watching now I recorded it for 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.810
 that you can see how it looks 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.430
 stabilized a moving image and 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.079
 how the exposure is adjusted when 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.400
 we went through places with different 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.989
 illumination 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.299
 in the stabilization section 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.430
 these two are also very 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.530
 cameras but if you look closely at the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.180
 image taken by the goal but there is less 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.939
 perception of movement when we go down 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.829
 the stairs like in the 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.599
 Previous engraving at 1080 to 30 frames 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.840
 per second and with all the adjustments per 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.390
 defect if we look at the shades of 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.709
 the colors the cj 4000 always has a 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.709
 little more towards bluish tones 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.890
 this next video has recorded him in the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.629
 inside of a garage so you can see 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.160
 how both cameras behave when 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.190
 We are in poor condition 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.459
 luminosity in this case just as 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.110
 you will see it win sj 4000 although none of 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.910
 the two cameras is designed to 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.580
 record in these conditions due to their 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.890
 small sensors the sj 4000 will 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.540
 It develops better and less noise 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.700
 images when we approach the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.370
 dark areas 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.319
 and I recommend that you 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.940
 better appreciate these differences you see 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.420
 the video in full screen and in 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.420
 hd quality 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.650
 as to possibilities of 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.870
 configuration the sj 4000 is superior to 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.250
 the go pro since it allows to adjust many 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.800
 more parameters from the menu 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.840
 configuration on the other hand the go pro is 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.669
 extremely simple to operate and 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.530
 has the quick start function that we 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.870
 allows you to start recording with just pressing 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.460
 a button without going through the 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.460
 process of turning on the camera 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.550
 this video that you are seeing is 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.470
 recorded in both cases at 720p to 60 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.500
 frames per second but I have rescaled 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.180
 at 1080p this drop at its speed of 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.949
 half reproduction for you to see 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.860
 how the cameras behave in slow 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.199
 motion in the case of the sj 4000 the 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.690
 frames are duplicated and the result is 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.210
 worse since in a second capture the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.979
 half of images that the go pro si os 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.690
 you look carefully you will see that when 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.090
 the car has passed the recording of the go 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.620
 pro is softer and continues the next 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.690
 video that I 'm going to show you is a test 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.430
 audio I have put to play music in 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.940
 an ipad and he has recorded his sound with the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.699
 cameras 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.699
 I leave you with the result 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.479
 now we go with the conclusions the sj 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.240
 4 min as negative aspects presents 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.729
 recording mode at 720p at 60 frames 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.409
 per second where it duplicates the frames the 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.899
 Battery life is less than 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.599
 of the go pro and the sound that it captures is 

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:37.249
 monkey in the negative aspects of the go 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.589
 but we found that the housing of 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:41.659
 the battery are not removable has 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:43.969
 worst results in low light and the 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.279
 superior price in terms of aspects 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.710
 positive of the sj 4000 are its price 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.539
 better results in low light and higher 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.669
 connectivity because there is a model with 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.369
 wi-fi and we have hdmi port for 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.469
 connect directly to a television the 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:00.529
 Positive aspects of the go pro turn are 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:03.080
 its ability to record at 720p to 60 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.119
 frames per second real is the sound that 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.249
 capture is stereo and has a greater 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.050
 battery life if you liked the 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:10.930
 video give a like and subscribe to me 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.919
 channel 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.919
 no no no
