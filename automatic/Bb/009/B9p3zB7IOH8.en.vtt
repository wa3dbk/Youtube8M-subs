00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.430
 fifth win of the season for sebastian 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.690
 slices of the 31st in our career are 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.900
 with leo turrini sent of the newspaper 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.820
 national leo vettel wins again not 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.769
 so he makes a great comeback from ninth to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.109
 second from the other Spanish that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 we will listen in a little confession that also 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 with the pool also starting from the pole 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 he would never have fettel today 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 the merit is certainly 10 and praise 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 because this is the track of the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 very great he crowned him did the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.949
 usual for him wonderful race must 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.899
 go see the difference between him and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.329
 carbide nor weber did you understand that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.000
 rightly chosen a pension because 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.010
 of the comparisons of this phenomenon pecks 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 simply bludgeon a little 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.200
 as a mass with alonso I also after the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.480
 vote from I do n't know but I would like to know how much 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 we must move forward with masses that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.879
 starts from the same row as the then 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.309
 same machine the same strategy e 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 comes after the music that is to say almost 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.370
 40 seconds later than the partner of 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 team then mass 0 weber 0 but i don't know 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.119
 I believe he drove very well 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 also made some good overtaking more than 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.439
 this could not get the remaining 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.390
 stain of the error of Saturday this yes 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.400
 but which in any case was not decisive from 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 what that soon 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.150
 we will hear from the words of fernando 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 alonso because also starting at the side 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.570
 of slices the front and immediately behind 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 we say that the red bull has shown of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 be slightly higher than alonso 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 he talks about three tenths of a difference 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 yes I believe that if Alonso left 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.220
 how could minimum from the second row 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 however he would have placed second 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
 but he would have had at least 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.900
 possibility we are always there to put 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 under pressure the bibitaro who 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 instead party went for a walk for that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 jumped hamilton to cannonball e 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.740
 the ferrari was too far behind 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.950
 here is the regret and this even though I am 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 agree with fernando in belgium the red 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 world champion bull was 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 unbeatable 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 and then we listen to launch for but also 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.110
 if I was first fine according to the same 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.350
 why 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.720
 beltel was between two and four tenths more 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 fast we recovered the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.970
 positions quite quickly and then 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.520
 when we were seconds behind him 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.830
 we ended up at 16 so eventually not 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.260
 is that it changed a lot however surely 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.950
 avoid the risk of leaving or 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.420
 overtaking 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.610
 we will try to better qualify the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.650
 next time we certainly did 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.540
 one step forward do we have 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.180
 regained a bit of competitiveness 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.920
 we know what's missing we have seen 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.320
 the strong mercedes we saw the red 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.540
 strong bull we saw the strong lotus 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.790
 even with many rules withdrawal therefore 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 we know we must continue to 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.430
 working our goal is to win 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 a few races in a row to go again 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.120
 fighting for the championship for that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.520
 we must work in the same direction 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.350
 what we did here was the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.480
 first step amounts there will be a second 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.209
 step singapore a third step then 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.010
 everyone is working 24 hours for this 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.530
 goal is the first step think that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.090
 we did the car very well 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.910
 it was fine in all the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.850
 full condition with no petrol 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.709
 in the end we also had the speed on 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.360
 straight that always offered us 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.310
 chance to overtake without losing 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.530
 too many rounds and this I think it was 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.720
 fundamental i also saw wever ho 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
 seen of people who were very fast 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.190
 but then came aretini could not 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.500
 then overtake the extra speed that 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.360
 we had on the straight it was also 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.130
 fundamental to help 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.470
 overtake but we always had to give the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.830
 one hundred percent every weekend and do 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.560
 all perfect on our part then if 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.630
 the others 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.310
 a few tenths more they do everything right 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.260
 they win the race we have to do 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.489
 congratulation this is a sport that 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.340
 had to improve for next time 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.840
 so we have done very well today 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.819
 we hope to do better 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.410
 turÃ¬n and there is no mention of a ferrari e 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.540
 rightly improved today over 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.550
 both the mercedes in front 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.959
 that especially to the lotus le 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.450
 prospects eight races to the conclusion 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.250
 almost 50 points to recover 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.050
 where this world championship is won 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.110
 to win you could start 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.670
 try to win it by dominating a monza 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.250
 then we saw something 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.850
 good this weekend because in the race 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.729
 the red one as you rightly remembered is 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.280
 back in front is the mercedes she has 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.799
 the lotus with alonso volante meaning me 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.610
 in hire with the Brazilian pre-pensioner 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.190
 so this is a good thing 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.320
 but we need to improve because 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.150
 vettel we know he's not wrong 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.850
 practically never 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.920
 has a very substantial advantage 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.200
 monza can be from this point of 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.300
 given the last beach I expect 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.340
 a great ferrara in brianza because if 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.070
 the trend what we caught referred in 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.960
 belgium compared to the summer of ours 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.740
 unhappy as intellectuals used to say 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.200
 there was a strong positive signal 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.560
 in short, we saw a Ferrari from 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 podium is an alonso I do not say in the wake 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.330
 but not very far away 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.430
 we go to monza hoping for the air of 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.050
 home face miracles have collapsed 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.630
 instead the quotations of hamilton and 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.250
 mercedes yes an arrow ticked this 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.960
 silver this mercedes 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.930
 I don't know makes me think of the di 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.650
 galley a little no hang you understand in the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.140
 meaning that they seemed to have become true anti 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.230
 red bull this pole again on Saturday 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.980
 all black to peel their hands then 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.410
 have made a race I have to say almost 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.150
 cheap because they never existed 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.050
 even in the fight for second place 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.450
 alonso detached lewis without problems 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.300
 and strange this mercedes thing is 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.250
 really weird because they just give you 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.470
 the impression of a discontinuity of 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.060
 performance that I 'm not there roses does not know if 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.010
 it's not very hot they suffer a little with the 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.050
 cool temperatures this a bit yes 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.240
 he knew then we hope that to monza 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.380
 an anticyclone arrives something in short 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.410
 let's put it this way in difficulty either 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.550
 hamilton that rosberg increasing the 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.560
 chance of the pony 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.030
 thanks to the turbines national framework 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.890
 appointment in two weeks great 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.020
 monza's prize today won 7 ahead 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.840
 ad alonso and hamilton and in the standings 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.910
 fernando at least 46 element is not 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.110
 slipped almost 60 points behind is 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.110
 all appointment to monza
