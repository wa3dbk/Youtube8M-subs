 6 to 10 years gaining his ability the second guest on this show 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.430
 we're going to talk behavior of dogs the behaviors of priests to 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 right now 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 this is a small change to live with eric good faith round they have us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960
 joined on the plateau bench tonight 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.230
 good evening thank you for being with us so he had crossed 1 5 not mean it 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.740
 must also that his voice establish my relationships to which the master 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.150
 respect the animal I was of course watching this word 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.000
 the animal quite 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.780
 so first I want to thank TV movie for lowering this 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.550
 this opportunity to present this profession for what is unknown 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.899
 often simply mediatized in the early ddd drama that occur 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.770
 especially with children 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 % and trades that bringing the little can bring a lot of comfort to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.570
 masters who accounts for behavioral problems with their 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.929
 dog behaviorally upside down what are you doing 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.330
 in any case no dressage 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.510
 then a behavioralist piece judged simply to say two words on this 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.670
 that did not know already 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.600
 for a behaviorist is not uncommon a trainer or an educator 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.550
 % and that's another kiki job that comes in addition to its toulouse 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.410
 problem 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.640
 percent the behaviorist is not a dog psychologist either 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 I respect too much 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.910
 luxury and colloquia 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.549
 for to accept the idea that we can 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.030
 confuse the fact that gap oak in consultation - it's the master who who 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.030
 leave asked for a consultation takes the behavioral problem 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.030
 the behavioral and it's someone who is trained in ethology cd 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 recognition of the dog's natural environment what is a dog these 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
 behaviors have entrenched me affects it was mentioned alain 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.510
 and then it's someone who is trained in human psychology 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.100
 for what is so she will work him at this intersection 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.620
 enter 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.290
 speaking what the animal 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 and those who is the master and in this unique and specific relationship between the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.830
 family to put him the dog who you really are an advanced system the 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 systemic psychology in everyone in its place 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.140
 each in his place instead of the other 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.140
 exactly this is one of the big difficulties 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:15.609
 of dads let's take to butcher in the place that should not be the 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.679
 his because 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:18.640
 the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.259
 in their misfortune 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.109
 in front of the important is the party restaurant thinks we have to keep his 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.570
 he must be happy 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.080
 and finally to hirson socopa too abstract for a dog I want the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
 people to go on my site voila wide and generous particular dedicated to 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.050
 to the notion of happiness and unhappiness to them around the dog who is some 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 very well managed thing you have to prepare the party while I appreciate 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.190
 it's only effective to the viewers that your site 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.070
 internet it's expensive fascine point en there are a lot of things on your 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.800
 way of working on saharan decorations the threats hovering over the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.130
 makes every situation unique and you need to know the famine 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.800
 the context in fact in the case of a purchase evolves that's the difference 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.180
 essential 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.560
 between counseling and help finally that's how juju see her from 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.730
 easily dispensable concessions 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.919
 and I was going to say usable by that bibliography that exists et cetera 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.380
 but the difficulty 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.520
 what most masters have that it's often seen to have the 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.210
 knowledge% and see what is the problem but finally comes back 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.219
 adapt 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 the executive protocols to put in place to rectify the situation 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.029
 to what are the masters and this is the most difficult focus because the 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.549
 people are not always aware of what they are doing or 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.619
 reasons and motivations that drives them to be 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.079
 in this scheming scheme when one appeals to your talents appeals to you 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.019
 hear case 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.889
 for what it is to educate his dog from the beginning is enough% then 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.120
 help us to change the trip to intervene as soon as possible 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.519
 see him let go duchy the acquisition of the giant could set up a 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.729
 a number of things 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.909
 for a lot of problems are related they are born of the ignorance 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.239
 not the dog 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.059
 in e1 - I will intervene banned between a behaviorist when the 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.929
 behavior becomes embarrassing 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:02.069
 I am proud 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.939
 just now an example on the fact that the labrador bridge that we're all 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.729
 small and who sees the quality of the song of the family binds belgium account of the 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.509
 dog is very friendly 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.639
 and that at one point 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.819
 m obama planned because but to put it 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.859
 can not watch tv katie on the armrest of the sofa 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.879
 opposite the hunt a sofa the value does not wait for his place and he does not want more 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.629
 leave his place because I do not have a careerist 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:27.800
 an opportunist 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.559
 it's how it works 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.589
 it goes from the moment they were allowed to believe they had a place 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.639
 eoth 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.969
 dean could goal where the dvd stapling in a claim to keep her 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.989
 and there are people who are still afraid of aggression in every 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:43.460
 state 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.580
 no it is simply a behavior adapted to date adapted to the situation 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.740
 who is perched a place 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.710
 you gave me the game you said it clearly said I wanted to do 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.479
 something is happening on the ground and therefore still intervene in these cases 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.720
 Listen, we intervene on a whore you attack things that are essential 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.199
 for dogs in canada code 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.629
 the the pyramid system of the pack including the fact that 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.680
 the top of the pyramid 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.809
 the confrere 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.639
 your heads allachie to the leader of moto polydor 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.990
 ideas and privileges 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.949
 that's why I could not serve and if the pilot nor a privilege on the 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.300
 small village food on reproduction 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.490
 privilege over access to the territory the sasson the privileges of the chief of 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.059
 pack 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:31.069
 so that in order to answer and his homework in the diagnosis 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.280
 sky dancers and shows in its modes of operation in the mode of 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.500
 family functioning 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.610
 2 but in the process of second on the ccc privileged access to each series 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.810
 all day or access to food 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.460
 whenever 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.919
 but it does not correspond to his ideology to his mode of operation 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.740
 good a lot of things like that there were also good rails positioning 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.030
 emotional 7 points then for the whole year quickly 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.760
 the newspaper comes back with us on the ideas of their followers the arranged 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.800
 often welcomed a dog with and children in families and then everything 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.360
 suddenly the charming children 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.849
 to replace will consider in more than one in every two cases 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.839
 the disaster welcoming classes to know the average cost dog is beautiful 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.069
 we are at ease and correspond to nothing rookie the most expensive family 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.619
 stay the whole time 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.259
 potentially dangerous the first speech one must have made is that 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.940
 you must have in mind it is clear charest 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.050
 a dog 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.810
 for actually he has this difference there is no dog 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.599
 dangerous 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.879
 there is no dangerous race in the judge and the snow for the money I say 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.779
 high and loud 

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.059
 % 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.939
 still 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.169
 we can notice a difference especially anatomy that betrayed their 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.539
 flesh of a kilo 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.569
 and l hadopi harman 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.150
 and she gets wandered the difference is especially about the impact of the bite 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.650
 please on the particular child who is the first target 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.560
 of these bites and and it should not be wrong a place a lot of dogs of 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.900
 company the labradors tane school of those therapies that are the ones that are 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.879
 causing many accidents 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.750
 Well, I, I was there 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.389
 and I met the previous false indicated 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.610
 with whom we will try to share something for them 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.280
 to work on prevention with children in school 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.880
 or extracurricular finally no matter 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.599
 but because we could avoid a number of accidents 

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.179
 and if the kids had an awareness that could 

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.639
 themselves made go back to the parents 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.899
 and then because the day will also come from adults 

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.809
 maybe even dog masters 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.889
 and he is in one as one teaches a child 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.699
 the meaning of the little red guy of the little green guy to cross the 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.270
 road 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.610
 I think it's obvious from our adult responsibility 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.349
 to teach them what a dog is like 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:38.639
 what we can do what we can not do 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.860
 very well thank you very much m at the base it was our invitation to the money 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.900
 appreciated by the spectators who can go on your valuable support point
