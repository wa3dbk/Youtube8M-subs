comfortably this is one of those things
we<00:00:44.800> have<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.040> learn<00:00:45.160> your<00:00:45.340> angle<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.730> your

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
we have to learn your angle to your

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.040 
we have to learn your angle to your
hands<00:00:46.000> too<00:00:46.210> low<00:00:46.329> you<00:00:46.480> can<00:00:46.600> see<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.870> if<00:00:46.960> your

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
hands too high you can see it so it's

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.639 
hands too high you can see it so it's
just<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:49.000> comfortable<00:00:49.390> angle<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.930> visibility

going to appear as if it pops out from

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.660 
going to appear as if it pops out from
just<00:01:07.690> your<00:01:07.780> fingertip<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:11.799> fingers<00:01:12.130> curl

so your middle finger brings the chip

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.890 
so your middle finger brings the chip
out<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.850> throw<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.209> up<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> air<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> stuff

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
out you throw it up in the air to stuff

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.770 
out you throw it up in the air to stuff
a<00:02:32.170> little<00:02:32.530> bit<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.130> get<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.730> momentum<00:02:34.000> these

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
a little bit to get the momentum these

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.060 
a little bit to get the momentum these
chips<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:36.220> fingers<00:02:36.640> move<00:02:37.180> out<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.630> way

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
chips these fingers move out of the way

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.620 
chips these fingers move out of the way
your<00:02:39.070> thumb<00:02:39.340> instantly<00:02:40.120> comes<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:43.480> give

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
your thumb instantly comes in to give

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.770 
your thumb instantly comes in to give
this<00:02:43.840> flick<00:02:44.170> right<00:02:44.920> here<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.340> edge<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
this flick right here on this edge to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.490 
this flick right here on this edge to
cause<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> snap<00:02:47.350> up<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> went<00:02:50.110> all<00:02:50.200> done

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
cause it the snap up and went all done

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.620 
cause it the snap up and went all done
together<00:02:50.730> timing<00:02:51.730> looks<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:55.510> when

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
together timing looks like this now when

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.080 
together timing looks like this now when
you<00:02:55.720> first<00:02:55.959> do<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.350> effect<00:02:56.769> I<00:02:57.010> guarantee<00:02:57.940> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
you first do this effect I guarantee you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.150 
you first do this effect I guarantee you
you're<00:02:58.300> going<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.480> shoot<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.590> chip<00:02:59.830> into<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
you're going to shoot the chip into the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.820 
you're going to shoot the chip into the
air<00:03:00.280> or<00:03:00.459> shoot<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.880> forward<00:03:01.150> about<00:03:01.300> four<00:03:01.570> feet

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
air or shoot it forward about four feet

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.140 
air or shoot it forward about four feet
then<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.920> know<00:03:03.040> you're<00:03:03.160> doing<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.430> right<00:03:03.580> so

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
then you know you're doing it right so

then you know you're doing it right so
the<00:03:04.239> next<00:03:04.360> time<00:03:04.540> someone<00:03:04.600> raises<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.230> twenty

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the next time someone raises you twenty

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.340 
the next time someone raises you twenty
bucks<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.890> can<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:06.310> I'm<00:03:06.880> in<00:03:07.209> there<00:03:08.080> isn't<00:03:08.320> a
