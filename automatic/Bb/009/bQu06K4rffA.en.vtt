00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hey guys it's coffee time I might be

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.009 
hey guys it's coffee time I might be
getting<00:00:08.280> sick<00:00:08.580> again<00:00:08.639> but<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> think<00:00:09.540> it's

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
getting sick again but I think it's

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.080 
getting sick again but I think it's
actually<00:00:10.200> allergies<00:00:11.010> which<00:00:11.429> also<00:00:11.670> sucks

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
actually allergies which also sucks

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.549 
actually allergies which also sucks
because<00:00:12.360> then<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.660> means<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.049> i<00:00:13.170> went<00:00:13.380> from

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
because then that means that i went from

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.580 
because then that means that i went from
being<00:00:14.099> actually<00:00:14.610> sick<00:00:14.839> to<00:00:15.839> having<00:00:16.170> allergies

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
being actually sick to having allergies

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.080 
being actually sick to having allergies
the<00:00:16.770> reason<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.070> think<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.310> allergies<00:00:17.490> instead

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the reason I think as allergies instead

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.429 
the reason I think as allergies instead
is<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.539> I'm<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.350> bit

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
is because I'm just like a little bit

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
is because I'm just like a little bit
congested<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.039> I've<00:00:20.160> had<00:00:20.820> random<00:00:21.300> little

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
congested and I've had random little

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470 
congested and I've had random little
coughing<00:00:22.080> fits<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:22.980> away<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> I'm<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
coughing fits that go away so I'm like I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.550 
coughing fits that go away so I'm like I
feel<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.750> there's<00:00:24.990> something<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> air

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
feel like there's something in the air

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.089 
feel like there's something in the air
that<00:00:25.760> I'm<00:00:26.760> breathing<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:27.710> that<00:00:28.710> makes<00:00:28.920> me

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that I'm breathing in that makes me

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.810 
that I'm breathing in that makes me

normally<00:03:18.540> what<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.720> do<00:03:18.950> because<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.190> always<00:03:20.340> go

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
normally what I do because we always go

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.970 
normally what I do because we always go
on<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.820> elliptical<00:03:21.270> or<00:03:22.170> cross<00:03:22.470> trainer<00:03:22.800> or

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
on the elliptical or cross trainer or

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.520 
on the elliptical or cross trainer or
whatever<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.310> call<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:24.390> whenever<00:03:25.200> we<00:03:25.410> go

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
whatever you call it but whenever we go

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.020 
whatever you call it but whenever we go
on<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> elliptical<00:03:26.840> they<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.709> little

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
on the elliptical they have the little

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.270 
on the elliptical they have the little
pre<00:03:30.030> settings<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:30.780> use<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:32.100> there's

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
pre settings that you can use so there's

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.080 
pre settings that you can use so there's
like<00:03:32.430> weight<00:03:33.000> loss<00:03:33.620> performance<00:03:34.620> um<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:36.030> think

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
like weight loss performance um I think

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.030 
like weight loss performance um I think
one<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.810> like<00:03:39.050> mountain<00:03:40.050> like<00:03:40.530> just<00:03:40.770> weird

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
one is like mountain like just weird

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.380 
one is like mountain like just weird
things<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:43.020> two<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.800> swap<00:03:44.160> between

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
things and the two that I swap between

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.820 
things and the two that I swap between
the<00:03:45.390> reason<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.810> remember<00:03:46.140> these<00:03:46.260> two<00:03:46.500> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
the reason that I remember these two is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.260 
the reason that I remember these two is
weight<00:03:47.250> loss<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.459> performance<00:03:48.000> cuz<00:03:48.120> weight

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
weight loss and performance cuz weight

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.540 
weight loss and performance cuz weight
loss<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.600> like<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.780> lot<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.410> like<00:03:49.620> four

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
loss I like a lot because it's like four

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.150 
loss I like a lot because it's like four
minutes<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.120> not<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.080> hard<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.560> then<00:03:52.950> four

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
minutes of not very hard and then four

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.530 
minutes of not very hard and then four
minutes<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.640> kind<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:53.970> hard<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.390> then

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
minutes of like kind of hard and then

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.820 
minutes of like kind of hard and then
four<00:03:54.750> minutes<00:03:54.989> not<00:03:55.170> very<00:03:55.350> hard<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.680> four

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
four minutes not very hard in four

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.140 
four minutes not very hard in four
minutes<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.130> kind<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.430> hard<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.000> just

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
minutes of kind of hard like it's just

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.380 
minutes of kind of hard like it's just
intervals<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.020> that<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:59.370> every<00:04:00.270> now

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
intervals and I like that but every now

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.640 
intervals and I like that but every now
and<00:04:00.570> then<00:04:00.660> when<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:00.870> feeling<00:04:01.110> good<00:04:01.470> about

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and then when I'm feeling good about

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.610 
and then when I'm feeling good about
