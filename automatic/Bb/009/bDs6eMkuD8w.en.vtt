00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
tub with a marker the spice is simple if

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.360 
tub with a marker the spice is simple if
you<00:00:49.220> can<00:00:49.400> get<00:00:49.550> that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.010

noticed is there are holes here and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.470 
noticed is there are holes here and
that's<00:01:00.560> going<00:01:00.740> to<00:01:00.800> let<00:01:00.980> cold<00:01:01.250> area<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.330> we're

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
that's going to let cold area so we're

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.630 
that's going to let cold area so we're
going<00:01:02.630> to<00:01:02.720> put<00:01:02.900> duct<00:01:03.140> tape<00:01:03.230> on<00:01:03.590> those<00:01:03.770> so<00:01:04.430> it'll

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
going to put duct tape on those so it'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.310 
going to put duct tape on those so it'll
be<00:01:04.760> sealed<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.420> only<00:01:05.630> entrance<00:01:05.960> for<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
stores so we found this mat stuff with

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.420 
stores so we found this mat stuff with
ridges<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:39.530> order<00:01:39.800> by<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.070> foot

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
ridges of it you can order by the foot

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.870 
ridges of it you can order by the foot
it's<00:01:40.729> about<00:01:40.940> three<00:01:41.840> bucks<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.170> foot<00:01:42.490> but<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:43.729> we

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
it's about three bucks a foot but if we

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.300 
it's about three bucks a foot but if we
only<00:01:44.030> did<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.240> foot<00:01:44.680> then<00:01:45.680> when<00:01:45.830> we<00:01:45.920> tried<00:01:46.160> to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
only did a foot then when we tried to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.310 
only did a foot then when we tried to
roll<00:01:46.520> it<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.910> ridges<00:01:47.300> would<00:01:47.509> not<00:01:47.720> work<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.200> we

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
roll it the ridges would not work so we

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.610 
roll it the ridges would not work so we
need<00:01:48.470> two<00:01:48.710> feet<00:01:49.009> actually<00:01:49.550> when<00:01:50.000> we<00:01:50.149> roll<00:01:50.450> this

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.010 

it's<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.860> see<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.180> then<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.330> can<00:01:58.600> see<00:01:58.780> there's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
it's to see and then you can see there's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's to see and then you can see there's
the<00:01:59.200> ridges<00:02:11.910> cut<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.090> stone<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.750> then

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the ridges cut this stone and then

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.840 
the ridges cut this stone and then
insert<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:15.000> into<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.120> hole<00:02:16.300> there<00:02:17.850> for

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
insert it right into that hole there for

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.610 
insert it right into that hole there for
the<00:02:18.940> bait<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.570> was<00:02:19.720> going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.020> put<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the bait that was going to put in the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.330 
the bait that was going to put in the
bottom<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.130> our<00:02:21.280> large<00:02:22.710> right<00:02:23.710> now<00:02:23.920> our<00:02:24.100> large

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
bottom of our large right now our large

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.950 
bottom of our large right now our large
stone<00:02:24.610> has<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> lot<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> stuff<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.660> minute

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
stone has a lot of stuff for a minute

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.600 
stone has a lot of stuff for a minute
we're<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> clean<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.620> out<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.250> put<00:02:27.490> in

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
we're going to clean that out and put in

we're going to clean that out and put in
these<00:02:27.760> big<00:02:28.000> papers<00:02:28.410> stair-step<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.890> here's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
these big papers stair-step so here's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.700 
these big papers stair-step so here's
what<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.460> did<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.910> bottom<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:32.470> took<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
what we did on the bottom we took a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.949 
what we did on the bottom we took a
piece<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.100> styrofoam<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.000> cut<00:02:34.209> off<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.810> was

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
piece of styrofoam and we cut off it was

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.780 
piece of styrofoam and we cut off it was
like<00:02:35.110> something<00:02:35.320> they<00:02:35.560> packed<00:02:36.190> something<00:02:36.640> in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
and we cut all the edges off so now

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.350 
and we cut all the edges off so now
we've<00:02:39.670> got<00:02:39.850> some<00:02:40.030> layers<00:02:40.270> of<00:02:40.510> styrofoam

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
we've got some layers of styrofoam

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.910 
we've got some layers of styrofoam
pieces<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.660> there<00:02:43.810> styrofoam<00:02:44.380> performs<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
pieces in there styrofoam performs the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.520 
pieces in there styrofoam performs the
installation<00:02:45.520> on<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> bottom<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.410> then

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
installation on the bottom and then

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.900 
installation on the bottom and then
we're<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.920> pull<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.310> some<00:02:48.550> rounded

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
we're going to just pull in some rounded

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.839 
we're going to just pull in some rounded
pieces<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.450> fill<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.020> out
