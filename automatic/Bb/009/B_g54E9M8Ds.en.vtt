00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
little activity on the Sun this week

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.520 
little activity on the Sun this week
we're<00:00:08.970> cutting<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.630> dead<00:00:09.960> zone<00:00:10.260> where

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
we're cutting in that dead zone where

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.799 
we're cutting in that dead zone where
nothing<00:00:11.070> really<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.490> happening<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:12.450> did<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
nothing really is happening we did have

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.570 
nothing really is happening we did have
that<00:00:12.929> one<00:00:13.380> solar<00:00:13.620> filament<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.340> thought

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
that one solar filament that we thought

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
that one solar filament that we thought
was<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.120> lift<00:00:15.719> off<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.960> Sun<00:00:16.320> but<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
was going to lift off the Sun but it's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.529 
was going to lift off the Sun but it's
managed<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> hang<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:17.910> sneaking<00:00:18.210> now

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
managed to hang on and it's sneaking now

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.359 
managed to hang on and it's sneaking now
around<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.080> west<00:00:19.289> side<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.650> limb<00:00:19.830> will<00:00:20.250> be

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
around the west side of the limb will be

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
around the west side of the limb will be
monitoring<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.359> rotates<00:00:21.539> around<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
monitoring that as it rotates around the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.160 
monitoring that as it rotates around the
backside<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:23.039> also<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.490> region<00:00:23.850> 2282<00:00:24.600> which

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
backside we also have region 2282 which

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.050 
backside we also have region 2282 which
is<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> state<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> decay<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.699> we've<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
is in a state of decay and we've got a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.880 
is in a state of decay and we've got a
couple<00:00:27.330> other<00:00:27.689> regions<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.289> trying<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
couple other regions that are trying to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.410 
couple other regions that are trying to
form<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.699> they're<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.000> not<00:00:30.150> getting

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
form but they're really not getting

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
form but they're really not getting
there<00:00:30.720> yet<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.320> only<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.890> waiting

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
there yet the only thing we're waiting

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
there yet the only thing we're waiting
for<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:32.910> bright<00:00:33.210> regions<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
for is some of these bright regions you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.479 
for is some of these bright regions you
see<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> behind<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> east<00:00:35.160> limb

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
see that are just behind the east limb

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
see that are just behind the east limb
as<00:00:35.700> those<00:00:36.120> rotate<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.780> view<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.079> might<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
as those rotate into view we might see a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610 
as those rotate into view we might see a
return<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> activity<00:00:39.290> switching<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.320> RM

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
return of activity switching to RM

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.200 
return of activity switching to RM
flower<00:00:40.829> threat<00:00:41.070> meter<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> last

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210

flower threat meter you can see the last
m-class<00:00:42.690> FLIR<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:43.950> februari

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
m-class FLIR we had was back on februari

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
m-class FLIR we had was back on februari
10th<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.360> basically<00:00:45.600> plummeted<00:00:46.410> since

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
10th and it's basically plummeted since

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
10th and it's basically plummeted since
then<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> last<00:00:47.700> couple<00:00:47.910> days<00:00:48.180> we've<00:00:48.390> been

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
then in the last couple days we've been

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
then in the last couple days we've been
pretty<00:00:48.840> much<00:00:49.020> flatlined<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:50.160> below<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
pretty much flatlined way below the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
pretty much flatlined way below the
seafloor<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> amateur<00:00:52.079> radio<00:00:52.260> operators

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
seafloor so you amateur radio operators

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.830 
seafloor so you amateur radio operators
and<00:00:53.129> emergency<00:00:53.610> responders<00:00:54.000> expect<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and emergency responders expect that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
and emergency responders expect that
continue<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> continue<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> next

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
continue to continue for over the next

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459 
continue to continue for over the next
few<00:00:56.610> days<00:00:56.820> until<00:00:57.030> those<00:00:57.660> bright<00:00:57.960> regions<00:00:58.320> on

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
few days until those bright regions on

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.180 
few days until those bright regions on
the<00:00:58.500> East<00:00:58.800> limb<00:00:59.059> pump<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> activity<00:01:00.780> again

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
the East limb pump up the activity again

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.229 
the East limb pump up the activity again
switching<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> your<00:01:02.489> solar<00:01:02.699> storm<00:01:03.030> conditions

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
switching to your solar storm conditions

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
switching to your solar storm conditions
you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.170> things<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:05.070> really

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you can see things actually got really

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
you can see things actually got really
quiet<00:01:05.519> starting<00:01:06.090> around<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.450> 12th<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> they

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
quiet starting around the 12th and they

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.320 
quiet starting around the 12th and they
remain<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.250> quiet<00:01:08.490> over<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> last<00:01:08.970> few

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
remain really quiet over the last few

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.929 
remain really quiet over the last few
days<00:01:09.570> until<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> solar<00:01:11.580> storm

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

disk<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.450> rotating<00:02:15.260> around<00:02:15.379> that's<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.159> one

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
disk here rotating around that's the one

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.429 
disk here rotating around that's the one
we're<00:02:16.459> waiting<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.120> show<00:02:17.780> up<00:02:17.930> on<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.260> east

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
we're waiting to show up on the east

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.589 
we're waiting to show up on the east
lamb<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.549> right<00:02:19.790> next<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.209> what<00:02:20.360> looks

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
lamb and it's right next to what looks

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.240 
lamb and it's right next to what looks
to<00:02:20.659> be<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.870> coronal<00:02:21.319> hole<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:21.769> that<00:02:21.920> may<00:02:22.069> be<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
to be a coronal hole so that may be the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.860 
to be a coronal hole so that may be the
reason<00:02:22.459> why<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.849> keeps<00:02:23.060> spinning<00:02:23.480> off<00:02:23.599> solar

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
reason why it keeps spinning off solar

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.440 
reason why it keeps spinning off solar
storms<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.560> also<00:02:25.519> you<00:02:25.819> can<00:02:25.970> see<00:02:26.060> there's<00:02:26.239> more

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
storms and also you can see there's more

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.509 
storms and also you can see there's more
activity<00:02:26.659> right<00:02:27.439> there<00:02:27.680> boom<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.159> see<00:02:28.340> that

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
activity right there boom you see that

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.699 
activity right there boom you see that
that<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.269> another<00:02:29.510> rejection<00:02:29.930> but<00:02:30.500> that

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
that is another rejection but that

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.770 
that is another rejection but that
region<00:02:31.129> won't<00:02:31.400> reach<00:02:31.700> us<00:02:31.940> probably<00:02:32.510> for

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
region won't reach us probably for

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.229 
region won't reach us probably for
another<00:02:32.840> 10<00:02:33.260> days<00:02:33.849> returning<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.060> disk

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
another 10 days returning to the disk

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.809 
another 10 days returning to the disk
you<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.480> see<00:02:35.690> region<00:02:36.019> 2282<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:37.040> rotating<00:02:37.610> off

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you can see region 2282 is rotating off

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.119 
you can see region 2282 is rotating off
of<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.120> west<00:02:38.329> limb<00:02:38.599> and<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.709> remnants

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
of the west limb and have the remnants

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.089 
of the west limb and have the remnants
of<00:02:40.220> 2284<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.450> kind<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> decaying<00:02:42.200> we<00:02:42.859> do<00:02:43.010> have

week so the past couple of days have

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.020 
week so the past couple of days have
given<00:04:06.470> us<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.680> really<00:04:06.980> nice<00:04:07.220> dose<00:04:07.519> of<00:04:07.699> Aurora

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
given us a really nice dose of Aurora

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.610 
given us a really nice dose of Aurora
pretty<00:04:08.419> much<00:04:08.599> all<00:04:08.780> over<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.139> world<00:04:09.319> and

pretty much all over the world and

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.830 
pretty much all over the world and
that's<00:04:10.099> come<00:04:10.430> from<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.790> grazing<00:04:11.540> solar

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
that's come from that grazing solar

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.710 
that's come from that grazing solar
storm<00:04:12.260> blow<00:04:12.650> along<00:04:12.949> with<00:04:13.579> that<00:04:13.760> enhanced<00:04:14.389> fast

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
storm blow along with that enhanced fast

storm blow along with that enhanced fast
wind<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:15.919> should<00:04:16.159> be<00:04:16.250> waning<00:04:16.579> now<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.359> the

next<00:04:17.690> 24<00:04:18.109> hours<00:04:18.139> or<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.769> along<00:04:19.609> with<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.090> we

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
next 24 hours or so along with that we

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.819 
next 24 hours or so along with that we
have<00:04:20.450> very<00:04:20.750> little<00:04:20.959> activity<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.739> the

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
have very little activity on the

have very little activity on the
earth-facing<00:04:22.219> disk<00:04:22.639> right<00:04:22.849> now<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.180> terms<00:04:23.360> of

earth-facing disk right now in terms of
flares<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.530> pretty<00:04:25.099> much<00:04:25.190> enjoy

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
flares so pretty much enjoy

quiet<00:04:26.120> over<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.510> next<00:04:26.750> few<00:04:26.870> days<00:04:27.110> at<00:04:28.010> least

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
quiet over the next few days at least

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.910 
quiet over the next few days at least
until<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.850> eastland<00:04:29.780> region<00:04:30.260> begins<00:04:30.770> to

until that eastland region begins to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.410 
until that eastland region begins to
rotate<00:04:31.160> into<00:04:31.610> Earth<00:04:31.790> view<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.180> we<00:04:32.240> get<00:04:32.390> a

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
rotate into Earth view and we get a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.060 
rotate into Earth view and we get a
better<00:04:32.630> look<00:04:32.720> at<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.350> see<00:04:33.380> whether<00:04:33.740> or<00:04:33.860> not

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
better look at it to see whether or not

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.490 
better look at it to see whether or not
it<00:04:34.220> has<00:04:34.400> any<00:04:34.670> magnetic<00:04:34.970> complexity<00:04:35.660> at<00:04:35.780> all<00:04:35.900> if

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
it has any magnetic complexity at all if

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.230 
it has any magnetic complexity at all if
that's<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.950> case<00:04:37.130> then<00:04:37.370> activity<00:04:38.060> might

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
that's the case then activity might

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.350 
that's the case then activity might
start<00:04:38.510> ramping<00:04:38.690> up<00:04:38.960> again<00:04:39.260> I'm<00:04:40.060> Tamil<00:04:41.060> disco
