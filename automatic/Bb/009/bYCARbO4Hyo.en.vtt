00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.970
 we meet. ozieri where a traditional cheese has been produced for over one hour 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.000
 century and a half 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.180
 let's talk about the gray viera a cheese that surely 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.830
 there is no celebration 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.560
 he contacts her but will surely not get a name from the GruyÃ¨re but most likely 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.869
 from the Swiss Argovia 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.050
 this form played and I was kept from raw milk 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.249
 it is really produced exclusively in this area 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.140
 the reality that had been brought by the Piedmontese 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.040
 to be precise from brahms 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 those then we talk giusec on and sofa 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.750
 eurotic why to teach 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.170
 harry let's say the Sardinians thanks to this type of dairy production 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.179
 a unique cheese of its kind 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.359
 a cheese that in any case thanks to the use of milk produced by 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.440
 stockfish of the brown breed 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.990
 alpine brunette 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.780
 this berry that gives mind to a milk with a pasture like from my shoulders 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.730
 fantastic theoretical bulla of pregnant perfumes cap. raw processed serving 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.539
 35 degree temperature 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.160
 to then be precisely 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.350
 passed with the kekko rennet at the time of the rind of the worked rennet 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.369
 at temperatures of 48 degrees 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.869
 we get very yellow cheeses like this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.229
 to these loves front 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.170
 ah. nagre viera that has roughly 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.539
 2 months a month and a half of the month 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.030
 you will notice how this cheese is in its aging phase 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.880
 it swells just because lactic acid meets with propio 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.070
 ribattini transforms a propionic attendance that makes ahahah spring 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 inside of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.600
 of the mass of the cheese. of the carbonic airs 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.770
 aleeee carbonica that penetrates. this catches 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.220
 the processing clearly based on the fishery format thing you will notice how many 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.230
 soft 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.040
 over the course of the months with more advanced curing 5 6 7 months 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.970
 This swelling is losing its roundness again 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770
 to return to flatten out 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.679
 to give us a pasta 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.219
 with very fine eyes 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.349
 they repeat, we confuse the gre viera with the Italian louviere needle 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.969
 of great eyes but here we are talking about a cheese 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.989
 really small eyes 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.939
 a long-seasoning cheese becomes 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.799
 granitic type we are facing or pro marco has a very large cheese 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.650
 r expression as regards its romantic complexity 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500
 a cheese of great prestige 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.620
 a cheese that today deserves the right success 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.889
 why we find ourselves 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.179
 in the face of that type of cheese that I would not call cheese 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.280
 niche that a word I like but dv finish in gerit form 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.609
 cheeses 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.849
 when I grow up 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.210
 cheeses meditation of a particular moment where we can jerk 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.170
 aromatic nuances 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.070
 precisely because of this with the milk that 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.549
 thanks also terpenes 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.620
 that nature gives us based on 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.849
 to laurel laurel fodder what brands eat 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.540
 we find ourselves with decidedly marked perfume tails 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 here the aromas are of yellow flowers 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.860
 with night also tendentially 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.100
 of blond tobacco 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.020
 but the incredible thing is that with the passing of the months a seasoning is formed 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.090
 already acquire aromas of exotic fruits 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.289
 3 the most recognizable is the pineapple 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:31.109
 spigaweb adozini clearly speaking of the young type of cheese 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.719
 which has two months maturing 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.180
 will find a felicia costa vento with very soft white whites of great size 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.019
 structure of complex whites 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.559
 as regards the aromatic kit 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.240
 just to name a few 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.070
 a vermentino di gallura would be ideal to match this point 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.780
 cheese 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.280
 brico of this territory a cheese in most holy canvases 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.889
 but with its freshness n 2 months with its burros ita 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.170
 succeeds in. 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.360
 with this wine to find this balance is this harmony that 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.350
 precisely cleans the taste buds 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.680
 from the fat ipod that the unripened prayer then leaves 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.470
 in the oral cavity anna 1100 on the cheese which is aged for 6 months in 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.049
 on 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.509
 clearly we need more structured wines cv that quid and double mavin 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.930
 arci a red wine red blowjob of great prestige 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.150
 the ideal would be narci of wines 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.140
 that they also have a night 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.140
 fruity face of great fragrance 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.800
 the gustatory impact at the entrance so we say from cost analysis and VAT give us 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.640
 of wines 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.770
 of great structure, almost chewable madidini the horrors i thick 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.020
 great plot 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.360
 abi must therefore a cagnulare otimo 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.569
 hothel carignano the sources 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.129
 let's say that there are two types of wine 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.759
 that b marry to this cheese produced. in the of silence 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.930
 but before the Piedmontese came the. to teach 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.220
 the production of the grades was here and also the cheeses came 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.880
 products 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.860
 with the Sardinian vaca and one of these forms gessa vanedda 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.610
 as you see these perette here called panada same produced however 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.969
 such as raw milk system 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.189
 in the same 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.949
 regarding the temperature assimilate 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.840
 however paul part obtain the form 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.510
 at decidedly higher temperatures that risk reaching over 60 degrees 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.410
 so imagine that these cheeses work 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.469
 what kind of skin it must have to withstand these highs 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.419
 so water temperatures 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.880
 of yourself where you want it is processed and incredible, however, cheeses 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.449
 always in this case I have some panheads at 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.850
 hair wife still young 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.170
 which, however, are cheeses that can also 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.130
 have a long seasoning ahead of them 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.510
 common volution of very interesting flavors 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.309
 sun cheese so I recommend it 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.300
 at lunchtime as well as appetizers 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.080
 but not the most seasonal one for what it wanted its flavors 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.360
 in its perfumes 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.740
 it is a cheese that could close with even interesting combinations like 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 poggi is perhaps used combining them with fruit compotes 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.259
 or with a wine statue or even with flags
