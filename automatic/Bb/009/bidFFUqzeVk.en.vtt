it<00:04:10.100> didn't<00:04:10.370> take<00:04:10.520> that<00:04:10.790> long<00:04:11.030> but<00:04:11.360> yeah<00:04:11.720> was<00:04:12.140> I

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
it didn't take that long but yeah was I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.730 
it didn't take that long but yeah was I
just<00:04:12.920> kind<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> being<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.580> little

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
just kind of being a little

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.560 
just kind of being a little
uncooperative<00:04:16.299> um

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
uncooperative um

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.920 
uncooperative um
yeah<00:04:18.320> again<00:04:18.590> here's<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.950> backing<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.630> what<00:04:20.900> I

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
yeah again here's the backing so what I

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.570 
yeah again here's the backing so what I
think<00:04:21.230> I'm<00:04:21.350> probably<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.799> do<00:04:22.010> I'm

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
think I'm probably going to do I'm

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.680 
think I'm probably going to do I'm
pretty<00:04:23.510> sure<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.880> stop<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.300> sonic

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
pretty sure that this the stop the sonic

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.080 
pretty sure that this the stop the sonic
drawing<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:27.200> on<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.530> odds<00:04:27.770> on<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.370> back<00:04:28.550> or<00:04:28.880> as

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
drawing is on the odds on the back or as

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.730 
drawing is on the odds on the back or as
on<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:30.790> card<00:04:31.790> piece<00:04:32.270> of<00:04:32.540> every<00:04:33.020> figure<00:04:33.230> but<00:04:33.590> if

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
on the card piece of every figure but if

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.940 
on the card piece of every figure but if
it's<00:04:33.890> not<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.550> think<00:04:35.420> of<00:04:35.570> its<00:04:35.720> Sonic<00:04:36.440> Tails<00:04:36.710> and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
it's not I think of its Sonic Tails and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.130 
it's not I think of its Sonic Tails and
Knuckles<00:04:37.040> I'll<00:04:37.760> probably<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.660> put<00:04:38.900> them<00:04:39.020> up

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
Knuckles I'll probably just put them up

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.540 
Knuckles I'll probably just put them up
like<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:40.070> showing<00:04:40.280> all<00:04:40.460> the

like that like showing all the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.040 
like that like showing all the

characters like the artwork and
everything<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:44.300> yeah<00:04:44.810> that<00:04:45.050> cuts<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.470> for<00:04:45.860> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180
