00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
pleasantly surprised by this and so

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.090 
pleasantly surprised by this and so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.180 
here's the color you can see it what I
did<00:03:30.579> I<00:03:30.819> wanted<00:03:31.359> it<00:03:31.540> ombre<00:03:32.049> but<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.410> didn't<00:03:32.920> want

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
did I wanted it ombre but I didn't want

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.680 
did I wanted it ombre but I didn't want
it<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> go<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.410> dark<00:03:36.340> roots<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
it to go from the dark roots to the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.559 
it to go from the dark roots to the
super<00:03:38.140> bright<00:03:38.380> Arman<00:03:39.190> on<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> bottom<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.090> so

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
super bright Arman on the bottom and so

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.420 
super bright Arman on the bottom and so
I<00:03:40.600> kind<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.410> pretty<00:03:41.620> much<00:03:41.799> highlight<00:03:42.280> at

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
yet best thing about making a unit I've

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.880 
yet best thing about making a unit I've
said<00:07:00.390> it<00:07:00.480> before<00:07:00.510> but<00:07:01.230> it's<00:07:01.560> gonna<00:07:01.710> be

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
said it before but it's gonna be

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.310 
said it before but it's gonna be
emphasized<00:07:02.340> you<00:07:03.000> can<00:07:03.180> switch<00:07:03.570> that<00:07:03.600> part<00:07:04.080> you

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
emphasized you can switch that part you

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.080 
emphasized you can switch that part you
can<00:07:04.470> either<00:07:04.650> part<00:07:04.920> it<00:07:05.040> somewhere<00:07:05.370> else<00:07:05.520> but<00:07:05.850> I

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
can either part it somewhere else but I

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.790 
can either part it somewhere else but I
really<00:07:06.540> like<00:07:06.750> the<00:07:06.930> way<00:07:07.020> this<00:07:07.170> will<00:07:07.380> look<00:07:07.590> so<00:07:07.770> I

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
really like the way this will look so I

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.120 
really like the way this will look so I
just<00:07:08.100> shift<00:07:08.670> it<00:07:08.850> over<00:07:09.240> if<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:10.530> want<00:07:10.770> a<00:07:10.830> center

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.130 
just shift it over if I want a center

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.740 
just shift it over if I want a center
part<00:07:11.400> and<00:07:12.560> do<00:07:13.560> it<00:07:13.710> that<00:07:13.920> way<00:07:14.100> and<00:07:14.400> then<00:07:14.520> I

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
part and do it that way and then I

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.210 
part and do it that way and then I
manipulate<00:07:15.750> it<00:07:15.960> until<00:07:16.110> it<00:07:16.470> looks<00:07:16.500> the<00:07:17.040> way<00:07:17.070> I

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
manipulate it until it looks the way I

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.880 
manipulate it until it looks the way I
wanted<00:07:17.700> I<00:07:17.880> don't<00:07:18.360> have<00:07:18.510> any<00:07:18.870> product<00:07:19.560> on<00:07:19.680> there

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890 
wanted I don't have any product on there
