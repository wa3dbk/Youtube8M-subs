castle but I'm pretty sure it's not I
think<00:03:35.560> its<00:03:35.680> courtyard<00:03:36.010> or<00:03:36.400> something<00:03:36.730> like

pretty much in this game I don't know

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.570 
pretty much in this game I don't know
it's<00:04:22.780> just<00:04:22.900> retarded<00:04:23.110> I<00:04:23.590> was<00:04:24.010> trapped<00:04:24.310> with<00:04:24.550> a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
it's just retarded I was trapped with a

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.010 
it's just retarded I was trapped with a
patch<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.030> gun

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
patch that gun

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.680 
patch that gun
at<00:04:26.530> least<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.830> little<00:04:26.979> bit<00:04:27.250> but<00:04:27.550> with<00:04:28.330> call<00:04:28.599> of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
at least a little bit but with call of

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.659 
at least a little bit but with call of
duty<00:04:28.900> black<00:04:28.930> ops<00:04:29.289> in<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.560> way<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.069> I<00:04:30.400> think

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
duty black ops in a way and I think

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.920 
duty black ops in a way and I think
they're<00:04:30.819> not<00:04:30.940> stupid<00:04:31.210> enough<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.569> make<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
they're not stupid enough to make the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.559 
they're not stupid enough to make the
same<00:04:32.080> mistake<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:33.550> hip<00:04:33.699> fire<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.330> gun

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
same mistake the hip fire and that gun

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.490 
same mistake the hip fire and that gun
is<00:04:34.750> just<00:04:34.990> ridiculous<00:04:35.530> as<00:04:35.710> well<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.720> yeah<00:04:38.289> my
