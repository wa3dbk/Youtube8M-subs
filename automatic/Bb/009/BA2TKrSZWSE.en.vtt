00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.960
 race how do you feel about it and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.090
 more than being in your hometown happy 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.640
 happy and especially the happy double 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.770
 for being in my hometown like you 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.710

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.870
 land that saw us grow as a musician 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.610
 like everything else this roll I do not know about 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.550

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.230
 we have passed contrary many thanks 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.030
 to the media at all the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.950
 people for putting up enough pasta for 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.810

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.370
 you felt the audience more before with that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.890
 they were three does not make us very happy 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.400
 reason the net the only thing that was very 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.590
 far 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.850
 I would have liked that well been more 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.159
 close because when people are 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.659
 close is different the patient vibrates the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.880
 emotion of people is going to be removed but 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.650
 but people can not continue dancing 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.920
