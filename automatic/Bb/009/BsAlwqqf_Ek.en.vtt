trying to protect those flower buds

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
trying to protect those flower buds
well<00:01:01.199> they'll<00:01:01.350> wrap<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> whole<00:01:02.039> bush<00:01:02.370> in

is<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.079> trick<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.470> those<00:01:49.649> those

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
is a little bit of trick to those those

are still a little bit more fussing our

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
are still a little bit more fussing our
areas<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.200> Kansas<00:01:53.189> they're<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> require

areas in Kansas they're going to require

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a constant supply of moisture these

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
a constant supply of moisture these
hydrangeas<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.659> also<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> prefer<00:01:58.229> the

grow where they have morning Sun and
afternoon<00:02:01.680> shade<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.610> put<00:02:02.820> them<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.000> too

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
afternoon shade if you put them in too

you put them in too much Sun then the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.630 
you put them in too much Sun then the
needs<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.740> water<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.220> they're<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> be

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
so high and they're going to scorch but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.339 
so high and they're going to scorch but
they<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.730> very<00:02:11.940> easy<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> grow<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.930> long<00:02:13.170> as

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
they are very easy to grow as long as

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.610 
they are very easy to grow as long as
you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.860 
you
even<00:02:14.280> moisture<00:02:14.599> constant<00:02:15.599> supply<00:02:15.750> of

even moisture constant supply of
fertilizer<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:17.160> you're<00:02:17.310> able<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.580> get

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
fertilizer and then you're able to get

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420 
fertilizer and then you're able to get
the<00:02:17.879> blooms<00:02:18.150> both<00:02:18.989> during<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> spring<00:02:20.220> and

a purple kind of mauve color in between

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.850 
a purple kind of mauve color in between
and<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.360> reason<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.870> see<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.290> difference<00:02:37.709> in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and the reason we see the difference in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.180 
and the reason we see the difference in
flower<00:02:38.099> color<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.730> based<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.209> soil<00:02:39.629> pH<00:02:40.470> levels

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
flower color is based on soil pH levels

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.000 
flower color is based on soil pH levels
if<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> pink<00:02:42.810> flowering<00:02:43.590> hydrangea

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
if you have a pink flowering hydrangea

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.309 
if you have a pink flowering hydrangea
that<00:02:44.819> means<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.420> an<00:02:45.540> alkaline<00:02:46.019> soil

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
that means you have an alkaline soil

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.759 
that means you have an alkaline soil
above<00:02:46.980> ph<00:02:47.459> 6.5<00:02:48.019> if<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> blue

above ph 6.5 if you have a blue
flowering<00:02:50.610> hydrangea<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.630> means<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.019> have

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
flowering hydrangea that means you have

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.330 
flowering hydrangea that means you have
a<00:02:52.230> more<00:02:52.560> acidic<00:02:52.920> soil<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.959> you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
a more acidic soil and the way you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
a more acidic soil and the way you
change<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.579> pH<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.180> really<00:02:57.799> based<00:02:58.799> on<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.280> you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
change the pH is really based on how you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.089 
change the pH is really based on how you
want<00:02:59.760> those<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.329> bloom<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:01.079> course<00:03:01.410> blue<00:03:01.769> is

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
want those the bloom of course blue is

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.490 
want those the bloom of course blue is
the<00:03:02.280> most<00:03:02.430> prized<00:03:02.910> color<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.200> gardener

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the most prized color for the gardener

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.520 
the most prized color for the gardener
pink<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.579> Kansas<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.120> easier<00:03:06.660> because<00:03:07.200> our

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
pink and Kansas is easier because our

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.250 
pink and Kansas is easier because our
soils<00:03:07.920> tend<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.430> naturally<00:03:08.940> high<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.269> pH<00:03:09.629> so

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
soils tend to be naturally high in pH so

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.869 
soils tend to be naturally high in pH so
you<00:03:10.319> plant<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.709> macrophylla<00:03:11.160> for<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.670> most

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
you plant a macrophylla for the most

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.660 
you plant a macrophylla for the most
part<00:03:12.209> you're<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.599> get<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> pink<00:03:13.200> bloom<00:03:13.670> to

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
part you're going to get a pink bloom to

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.930 
part you're going to get a pink bloom to
lower<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.209> pH<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> blue<00:03:16.590> bloom<00:03:16.950> first

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
lower the pH to get a blue bloom first

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.539 
lower the pH to get a blue bloom first
thing<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.180> need<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.389> do<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.720> take<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> soil<00:03:19.139> test

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
thing you need to do is take a soil test

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.069 
thing you need to do is take a soil test
which<00:03:20.549> soil<00:03:20.790> testing<00:03:21.269> can<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.630> done<00:03:21.660> through

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
which soil testing can be done through

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.740 
which soil testing can be done through
k-state<00:03:22.680> Extension<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.940> basically<00:03:24.510> you're

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
k-state Extension but basically you're

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
k-state Extension but basically you're
going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> start<00:03:25.260> your<00:03:25.440> initial<00:03:25.799> lowering<00:03:26.220> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
going to start your initial lowering the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.000 
going to start your initial lowering the
pH<00:03:26.549> through<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> software<00:03:27.720> application<00:03:28.010> so

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
pH through a software application so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.890 
pH through a software application so
instead<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.519> just<00:03:29.730> planting<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.209> planting<00:03:30.690> hole

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
instead of just planting a planting hole

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.660 
instead of just planting a planting hole
with<00:03:31.109> a<00:03:31.139> new<00:03:31.319> plant<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.829> may<00:03:31.950> want<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.250> plant<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670
