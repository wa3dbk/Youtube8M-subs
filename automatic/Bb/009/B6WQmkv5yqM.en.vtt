00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
turbo towards the basket just as if you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
were driving and once you do that it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.170 
were driving and once you do that it
depends<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.369> where<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> court

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
depends on where you're out on the court

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
depends on where you're out on the court
but<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.409> case<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> would

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
but you know in my case on there I would

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.530 
but you know in my case on there I would
have<00:01:23.400> been<00:01:23.520> moving<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.030> stick<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
have been moving the right stick to the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
have been moving the right stick to the
left<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:24.930> that's<00:01:25.259> away<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> basket

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
left because that's away from the basket

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.010 
left because that's away from the basket
on<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.400> view<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> move<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.869> away<00:01:27.960> from

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
on my view you want to move it away from

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.859 
on my view you want to move it away from
the<00:01:28.259> basket<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.240> whatever<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> opposite

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the basket so whatever is the opposite

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.210 
the basket so whatever is the opposite
direction<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> hoop<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.920> where<00:01:32.130> the

direction of the hoop that's where the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
direction of the hoop that's where the
right<00:01:32.400> sticks<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.869> hold<00:01:34.020> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
trigger when you're dribbling towards

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.860 
trigger when you're dribbling towards
basket<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.880> can<00:03:24.000> see<00:03:24.150> me<00:03:24.300> trying<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.750> it

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
basket you can see me trying to do it

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.510 
basket you can see me trying to do it
there<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.110> waited<00:03:25.620> too<00:03:25.650> long<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.280> about

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
there I waited too long it's about

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.220 
there I waited too long it's about
timing<00:03:26.850> as<00:03:27.090> well<00:03:27.270> once<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.750> hit<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.960> paint

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
timing as well once you hit the paint

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.470 
timing as well once you hit the paint
you<00:03:28.410> should<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.740> you<00:03:29.160> should<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.430> shooting<00:03:29.610> so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
you should be you should be shooting so

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210 
you should be you should be shooting so
you<00:03:31.260> hold<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.830> hold<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> right

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
you hold it you can hold the right

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.800 
you hold it you can hold the right
trigger<00:03:32.430> down<00:03:32.700> basically<00:03:33.210> once<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.660> some

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
trigger down basically once you get some

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.590 
trigger down basically once you get some
momentum<00:03:33.900> up<00:03:34.320> take<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> dribble<00:03:35.520> or<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.910> hold

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
momentum up take a dribble or to hold

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.310 
momentum up take a dribble or to hold
the<00:03:36.750> right<00:03:36.930> or<00:03:37.140> hold<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> left<00:03:37.800> trigger<00:03:38.040> and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
the right or hold the left trigger and

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.900 
the right or hold the left trigger and
then<00:03:40.320> press<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.040> right<00:03:41.190> stick<00:03:41.460> away<00:03:41.610> from<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
then press the right stick away from the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.360 
then press the right stick away from the
basket<00:03:42.090> you'll<00:03:42.510> do<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.690> cool<00:03:42.930> spin<00:03:43.230> move<00:03:43.470> this

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
basket you'll do a cool spin move this

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.460 
basket you'll do a cool spin move this
is<00:03:44.490> not<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.790> same<00:03:44.940> as<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:46.020> other<00:03:46.140> spin

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
is not the same as the the other spin

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.050 
is not the same as the the other spin
move<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:46.920> can<00:03:47.220> use<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.490> my<00:03:47.640> player<00:03:47.880> that

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
move that you can use in my player that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.040 
move that you can use in my player that
will<00:03:48.120> basically<00:03:48.300> get<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.720> called<00:03:48.930> for

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
will basically get you called for

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.510 
will basically get you called for
traveling<00:03:49.230> or<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.620> foul<00:03:49.860> every<00:03:49.890> time<00:03:50.310> this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
traveling or a foul every time this

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.670 
traveling or a foul every time this
one's<00:03:50.730> actually<00:03:50.880> effective<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:51.810> if<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.560> can

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
one's actually effective so if you can

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.900 
one's actually effective so if you can
do<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.070> have<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.250> right<00:03:53.430> amount<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.760> space

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
do it you have the right amount of space

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.720 
do it you have the right amount of space
between<00:03:54.210> you<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.600> defender<00:03:55.550> don't<00:03:56.550> use

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
between you and the defender don't use

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.360 
between you and the defender don't use
turbo<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.530> move<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.800> stick<00:03:59.070> away<00:03:59.190> for

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
turbo and move the right stick away for

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.980 
turbo and move the right stick away for
the<00:03:59.430> basket<00:03:59.850> as<00:03:59.970> if<00:04:00.210> you<00:04:00.330> were<00:04:00.420> doing<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.750> spin

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
the basket as if you were doing a spin

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.210 
the basket as if you were doing a spin
dunk<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.910> then<00:04:02.910> shoot<00:04:03.180> you're<00:04:03.750> good<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.020> go

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
dunk and then shoot you're good to go

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.180 
dunk and then shoot you're good to go
and<00:04:06.020> finally<00:04:07.020> last<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.440> not<00:04:07.650> least<00:04:07.710> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
and finally last but not least the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.510 
and finally last but not least the
all-powerful<00:04:08.610> Euro<00:04:09.330> step<00:04:09.840> layup<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:11.370> what

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
all-powerful Euro step layup that's what

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.910 
all-powerful Euro step layup that's what
I'm<00:04:11.610> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.760> be<00:04:11.850> doing<00:04:11.970> next<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.800> will

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
I'm going to be doing next and that will

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.730 
I'm going to be doing next and that will
get<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> lot<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.550> fouls<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
get you a lot of fouls and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.490 
get you a lot of fouls and
is<00:04:16.010> pretty<00:04:16.340> useful<00:04:16.580> in<00:04:17.000> online<00:04:17.450> games<00:04:18.080> as<00:04:18.320> well

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
is pretty useful in online games as well

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.520 
is pretty useful in online games as well
I<00:04:18.830> don't<00:04:19.400> abuse<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.360> do<00:04:20.750> use<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.110> every<00:04:21.410> now

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
I don't abuse it I do use it every now

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.080 
I don't abuse it I do use it every now
and<00:04:21.709> again<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:22.220> one<00:04:22.460> of<00:04:22.490> our<00:04:22.610> recent<00:04:22.820> crew

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
and again in one of our recent crew

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.000 
and again in one of our recent crew
videos<00:04:23.480> that<00:04:23.720> was<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.050> there<00:04:24.260> Mikey<00:04:24.830> did<00:04:24.950> a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
videos that was on there Mikey did a

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.950 
videos that was on there Mikey did a
pretty<00:04:25.160> cool<00:04:25.400> one<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:26.360> while<00:04:26.780> dribbling

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
pretty cool one but while dribbling

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.170 
pretty cool one but while dribbling
towards<00:04:27.230> masket<00:04:27.770> move<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.700> right<00:04:28.910> stick

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
towards masket move the right stick

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.000 
towards masket move the right stick
towards<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.660> basket<00:04:29.810> plus<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.620> left<00:04:30.800> trigger

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
towards the basket plus the left trigger

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.390 
towards the basket plus the left trigger
so<00:04:31.790> same<00:04:32.750> thing<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.410> signature<00:04:33.830> stuff<00:04:34.100> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
so same thing as the signature stuff the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.820 
so same thing as the signature stuff the
signature<00:04:34.760> dunks<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.260> was<00:04:36.380> talking<00:04:36.500> about

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
signature dunks that I was talking about

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.770 
signature dunks that I was talking about
earlier<00:04:36.860> towards<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.880> basket<00:04:38.030> left<00:04:38.570> trigger

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
earlier towards the basket left trigger

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.710 
earlier towards the basket left trigger
soon<00:04:39.230> as<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.410> get<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.620> paint<00:04:39.860> do<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.880> the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
soon as you get the paint do it the

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.480 
soon as you get the paint do it the
problem<00:04:42.080> for<00:04:42.110> me<00:04:42.290> is<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.890> right<00:04:43.040> sticks<00:04:43.310> kind

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
problem for me is the right sticks kind

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.010 
problem for me is the right sticks kind
of<00:04:43.550> finicky<00:04:43.850> with<00:04:44.090> this<00:04:44.240> one<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.480> had<00:04:44.690> trouble

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
of finicky with this one I had trouble

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.750 
of finicky with this one I had trouble
getting<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.290> timing<00:04:45.530> down<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.400> if<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.580> want

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
getting the timing down so if you want

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.600 
getting the timing down so if you want
to<00:04:46.850> substitute<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:48.830> I<00:04:48.860> do<00:04:49.010> to<00:04:49.430> make<00:04:49.550> it

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
to substitute what I do to make it

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.370 
to substitute what I do to make it
easier<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.270> more<00:04:50.360> consistent<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:51.050> me<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.230> do

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
easier and more consistent for me to do

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.040 
easier and more consistent for me to do
a<00:04:51.410> gyro<00:04:51.730> as<00:04:52.730> soon<00:04:52.910> as<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.090> get<00:04:53.150> to<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.630> paint<00:04:53.840> you

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
a gyro as soon as I get to the paint you

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.540 
a gyro as soon as I get to the paint you
can<00:04:54.170> see<00:04:54.290> I<00:04:54.320> messed<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.770> one<00:04:54.950> up<00:04:55.010> because<00:04:55.310> I

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
can see I messed that one up because I

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.740 
can see I messed that one up because I
was<00:04:55.670> trying<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.940> do<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.270> right<00:04:56.450> stick
