 decision I make but I'm going to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 tell at the end this videoblog that this 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 is going to be when the bar of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.149
 reproduction is more or less here or 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 here or there or there I do not know why 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.870
 what youtube is a page that changes 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.420
 design with unknown criteria 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 green pillow what I will tell you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 is what happened you remember that I 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.920
 I had an animated superhero series 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.060
 with mask and identity completely 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 unknown 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.480
 of course the animated series of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 supernatural that you are seeing now in 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.950
 screen and if they do not know and I published 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.530
 11 episodes of the series in 2012 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 and after a while finishing the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.040
 first season and the good news is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.540
 that in the axis that you have, I'm not going to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.120
 make new chapters of super mart one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.850
 of them I started to do something history 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.350
 begins when in July of this year 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.430
 I started to work a special chapter 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.430
 of super March Saturday 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.170
 then he wrote a gravity script 12 and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.119
 when I finish the degree to the voices 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.250
 been with the microphone in front and had 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.290
 a whole hour alone at home then what 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.689
 what I did was take the guitar and produce 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.759
 a song after is an animation in 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.180

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.620
 efe of m 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.320

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.550

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.680
