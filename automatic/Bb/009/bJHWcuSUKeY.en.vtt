00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 depot spring breaks after 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:12.030
 this bus question was thanked we have 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.950
 now by the washing system as you can see 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 the washing machine starts on its own 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.340
 So we hope no card like it at 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 a pk is substantially 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.340
 we wash about say I say 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 between 60 and 80 buses a day 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.120
 Of course the whole lot but you have to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.559
 We say we have a wife 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.980
 water treatment 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.210
 that means 80 percent of the water 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.469
 fed again 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.039
 only that is already minimized 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.590
 and the car wash consumption per minute 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.719
 about 500 liters of water 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.610
 And one more advantage is you need it 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.730
 outside mirror not decrease here 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.149
 the brushes automatically recognize the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.760
 outside mirror and feel around it 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.650
 is a big advantage 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.689
 or was that different you had to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.990
 Reflection take off lateral 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.299
 autohochburg what evil so I say 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.820
 just times when the buses in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.490
 autumn and winter are dirtier is one 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.470
 great result 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.840
 we have the water system that way 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.390
 adjusted 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.439
 in the morning inside area if you want something more 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 time is right washing the brushes 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.659
 on the way there and on the way back and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.939
 evenings and peak times we only have 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.479
 on the hinrich and back they run 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 empty 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.590
 this will save us half a minute 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.439
 Time 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.649
 it will not be much now but I say 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.540
 times with a driveway of 40 buses 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.899
 within an hour's time 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899
 already noticeable 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.170
 and is it coming to an end with the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.620
 you are already waiting for the washing process 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 Colleague behind us and wants the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.830
 wash next 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.290
 that is, when they are green now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.290
 I have to jump before riding
