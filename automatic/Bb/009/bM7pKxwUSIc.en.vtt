00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 the youtube people this priscilla and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.700
 free today is more a way for gts 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.460
 years in today's mode it will add 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 in your gt to a private mototaxi tá 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.260
 So every time when you want to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.630
 move to a place far or near 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 with a simple command you'll mark there 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.730
 on the map and get a mototaxi command 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.010
 Go get you where you are, be there. 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.199
 wherever you are and will take you to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 location marked on the map is a good way 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.969
 simple very light then any pc of the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.290
 I do not care if you have molds 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.960
 or it will not work normally 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.809
 is a way unfortunately time the errors 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.480
 sometimes it fleas and not to a location 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 sure it takes a much larger 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.700
 that should but but that way does not have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.710
 so many mistakes that you 'll heat up 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 head and get angry is not the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.940
 want to put the computer but does not have 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.039
 make those mistakes then be aware of it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.649
 also obviously the inscription just the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.660
 name of the author of the template the site of everything 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.220
 just right if you want to check and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.350
 you do not need to copy files 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 It's because in this video I'm going 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.340
 so then now let's go to the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.340

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.009
