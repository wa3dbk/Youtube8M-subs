00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.720
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.690
 I'm going to show you today how to recover the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:16.619
 system back there in a previous point 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.070
 so you can be recovering 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 files that you lost there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.949
 unintentionally deleted for example and or 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.160
 undo a shit right there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.270
 There are a lot of people who do some things. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 What computer is zapped and I'm going to show it? 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.110
 Click the Start button 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110
 control 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.539
 it basically goes back in time and everything 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.000
 what you did for example today if you have 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.300
 downloaded some program to delete some 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 thing that I do not want today I 'm going to do 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 This recovery is here in the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.989
 control panel 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.439
 You come here in recovery so what? 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 you happen 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 going back in time there for example the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.799
 last week I will choose a date 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.939
 here in case I will not have what I want 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.770
 I did today or yesterday before last order 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.210
 so you have to be pretty sure 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 personal but it's simple 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 then asked the start panel button 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 control of this system and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.369
 this screen will appear here where 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.049
 maybe just go back a little bit 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.290
 restore the computer to a point 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.790
 Earlier in time, I understood. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.329
 here to open system restore only 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.329
 click here 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.600
 and it will open the resolution 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.100
 He gives me this little screen here and only 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.930
 restore files and settings 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.320
 system 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.270
 so what happens here is he already gives me 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.700
 a date set kyoto recording here 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.830
 today on the 9th of 2013 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.520
 so he 's giving me that five day 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.360
 of December 2003 nine o'clock 9 hours 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.400
 it's 1 minute 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.420
 is the point that he thinks is better than 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.640
 computer was cool and here you can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.750
 choose another restore point if 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.390
 You think I buy, I was not. 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 so much what you want more 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.680
 Anyway, just squeeze here in advance. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.740
 I'd rather leave it here, I lost too. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.740
 that is indicates you leave it here 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.690
 because it is already a definite thing of the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.310
 windows is much better, but you can 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.500
 choose another than normally any 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.920
 thing works out can come back again 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.780
 to go back to another point is that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.730
 My record is saying that with this 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.780
 except for these prayers, it is known that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 on this disk 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:59.090
 and then just conclude I squeeze in to conclude 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.160
 see detail well you have to read here 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.830
 this one is one of the most 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.660
 is important once the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.130
 system restore can not be 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.130
 you want to continue after the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.540
 You put it in yes it already was not 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.430
 it's better to do nothing yet feel 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.959
 plus the computer 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 Anyway, but you're not going to do that already. 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.180
 I tried to clean it up 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.050
 and I'll stay in not here because I do not 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.050
 I'm quoting from this service now but already 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.340
 I did a lot, so there's the tip person 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:39.340
 This is very good for who, for example, there 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.650
 folks 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:47.800
 is the pay erase several pictures around the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.129
 antigen and then repents and 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.440
 I made it here in the first place. 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.260
 Any shit of yours is this here. 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.690
 It helps a lot It's very good, very good. 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.410
 even if you like to mess around with 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:06.780
 settings told a young person 's personal 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.780
 and if possible and can criticize the will
