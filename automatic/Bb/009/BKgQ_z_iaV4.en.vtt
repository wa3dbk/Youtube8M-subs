but if you bring it straight up over

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.369 
but if you bring it straight up over
your<00:02:27.980> hips<00:02:28.250> that's<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.300> best<00:02:29.510> spot<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:30.200> work

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
your hips that's the best spot to work

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.509 
your hips that's the best spot to work
and<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.769> really<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.220> think<00:02:31.430> about

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
and you really want to think about

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.089 
and you really want to think about
squeezing<00:02:31.849> your<00:02:32.180> thighs<00:02:32.209> together<00:02:32.870> as<00:02:33.379> you're

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
squeezing your thighs together as you're

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
doing this

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.849 
doing this
and<00:02:35.090> again<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.390> want<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.599> do<00:02:35.719> it<00:02:35.870> until<00:02:36.019> you

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
and again you want to do it until you

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.970 
and again you want to do it until you
cannot<00:02:37.159> complete<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> exercise<00:02:38.150> anymore

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
cannot complete the exercise anymore

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.869 
cannot complete the exercise anymore
so<00:02:39.980> those<00:02:40.219> are<00:02:40.370> two<00:02:40.400> inner<00:02:41.090> thigh<00:02:41.389> exercises

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879

tension<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.450> band<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.200> what<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:38.680> going

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
tension on the band and what I'm going

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.100 
tension on the band and what I'm going
to<00:03:38.860> do<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.100> lift<00:03:39.340> up<00:03:39.550> using<00:03:40.180> my<00:03:40.420> glutes<00:03:40.660> only

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
to do is lift up using my glutes only

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.760 
to do is lift up using my glutes only
and<00:03:41.380> come<00:03:42.130> down

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
and come down

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.810 
and come down
sweep<00:03:43.370> up<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.630> down<00:03:44.920> again<00:03:45.920> if<00:03:46.400> I'm<00:03:46.580> feeling

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
sweep up and down again if I'm feeling

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.130 
sweep up and down again if I'm feeling
it<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.270> my<00:03:47.300> lower<00:03:47.600> back

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
it in my lower back

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.800 
it in my lower back
that<00:03:48.500> means<00:03:48.710> I'm<00:03:48.950> not<00:03:49.360> keeping<00:03:50.360> my<00:03:50.510> back

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
that means I'm not keeping my back

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.410 
that means I'm not keeping my back
grounded<00:03:51.440> I'm<00:03:51.920> arching<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:52.940> really<00:03:53.270> won't

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
grounded I'm arching so I really won't

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.440 
grounded I'm arching so I really won't
just<00:03:53.720> use<00:03:53.900> my<00:03:54.110> glutes<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.740> lift

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
just use my glutes to lift

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.080 
just use my glutes to lift
so<00:03:56.450> next<00:03:57.020> part<00:03:57.200> holding<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.310> you're<00:03:59.000> going

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
so next part holding it up you're going

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.140 
so next part holding it up you're going
to<00:03:59.210> push<00:03:59.450> up<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.770> band<00:04:01.010> while<00:04:01.670> you<00:04:01.820> lift<00:04:02.000> it

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
to push up on the band while you lift it

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.850 
to push up on the band while you lift it
as<00:04:02.240> high<00:04:02.450> as<00:04:02.480> possible<00:04:03.670> continue<00:04:04.670> squeezing

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
as high as possible continue squeezing

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.420 
as high as possible continue squeezing
then<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:07.310> can<00:04:07.460> pulse<00:04:07.700> up<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:09.070> again<00:04:10.070> keep

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
then you can pulse up and again keep

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.700 
then you can pulse up and again keep
always<00:04:10.910> keep<00:04:11.090> tension<00:04:11.390> pressing<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.320> upwards

it pushing straight up to the ceiling

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.300 
it pushing straight up to the ceiling
it's<00:05:14.490> level<00:05:14.790> two<00:05:14.820> level<00:05:15.270> three<00:05:16.220> bring<00:05:17.220> that

it's level two level three bring that

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.000 
it's level two level three bring that
leg<00:05:17.610> down<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.360> both<00:05:18.540> legs<00:05:18.690> are<00:05:18.930> mine<00:05:19.200> you

leg down so both legs are mine you

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.280 
leg down so both legs are mine you
shouldn't<00:05:20.250> do<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.430> heel<00:05:20.610> again<00:05:21.390> that's<00:05:22.140> going

shouldn't do the heel again that's going

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.910 
shouldn't do the heel again that's going
to<00:05:22.350> make<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.650> even<00:05:22.920> more<00:05:22.950> difficult<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:24.920> of

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
to make it even more difficult and of

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.800 
to make it even more difficult and of
course<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.190> do<00:05:26.400> both<00:05:26.520> sides<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:27.450> want<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.660> try

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
course you do both sides you want to try

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.690 
course you do both sides you want to try
to<00:05:27.870> keep<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.230> even<00:05:28.350> so<00:05:29.040> trying<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.460> do<00:05:29.550> both

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
to keep it even so trying to do both

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.820 
to keep it even so trying to do both
sides<00:05:29.970> either<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.570> fatigue<00:05:30.930> or<00:05:31.140> about<00:05:31.800> a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
sides either to fatigue or about a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.070 
sides either to fatigue or about a
minute<00:05:32.160> each<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.730> again<00:05:33.300> just<00:05:33.570> like<00:05:33.720> all<00:05:33.930> the

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
minute each and again just like all the
