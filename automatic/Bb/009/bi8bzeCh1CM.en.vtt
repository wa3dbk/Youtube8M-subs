00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.780
 martin as a preparer we train 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.200
 know what we can do ours 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.229
 ability and do we have that over 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 waters realized our goal was clear 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:19.409
 we know what we had to do 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.409
 I think now the team performance is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.850
 the massive expects swedish and that 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 is extreme 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.649
 We knew how to get out of Sweden now 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.390
 made the connection hit what too 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.520
 just before half-time was already possible 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.259
 then such a game can sweden sweden 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.679
 has proven many times that you have a game 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.679
 can turn 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 i have to say i like to like strong 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.740
 opponents play and I am too 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.130
 actually far away from damage so I once 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.980
 played and today with the whole defense 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.630
 So chain the four offensively 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.070
 spied out and that was the most important 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:54.770
 because we know that waves have 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.770
 I think we did 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.420
 we want to provide a surprise 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.420
 I think that's us today
