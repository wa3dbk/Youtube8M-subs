and what happened there what you got
there<00:00:31.599> she<00:00:32.590> just<00:00:32.619> snapped<00:00:33.040> off<00:00:35.699> this<00:00:36.699> bolt

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
there she just snapped off this bolt

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.920 
there she just snapped off this bolt
actually<00:00:37.270> holds<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:38.219> ball<00:00:39.219> joint<00:00:39.520> in<00:00:39.930> so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
actually holds the ball joint in so

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.360 
actually holds the ball joint in so
here's<00:00:41.109> the<00:00:41.320> replacement<00:00:41.949> ball<00:00:42.070> joint

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
here's the replacement ball joint

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
here's the replacement ball joint
basically<00:00:42.820> how<00:00:42.910> that<00:00:42.940> bolt<00:00:43.329> holds<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.230> in<00:00:44.379> is

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
basically how that bolt holds it in is

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.000 
basically how that bolt holds it in is
goes<00:00:46.660> through<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.930> hole<00:00:47.170> there's<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.590> shoulder

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
goes through a hole there's a shoulder

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.060 
goes through a hole there's a shoulder
on<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.760> locks<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.239> in<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:49.510> way

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
on it and it locks it in this way

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.930 
on it and it locks it in this way
much<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.250> going<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.460> shifter<00:00:51.789> in<00:00:51.879> a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
much like going to shifter in a

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.750 
much like going to shifter in a
motorcycle<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.469> we'll<00:00:53.590> take<00:00:53.769> a<00:00:53.800> punch<00:00:54.250> now<00:00:54.489> and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
motorcycle so we'll take a punch now and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.150 
motorcycle so we'll take a punch now and
I<00:00:54.879> knock<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.390> bolt<00:00:55.570> out<00:01:01.949> we're<00:01:02.949> going<00:01:03.039> to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
I knock that bolt out we're going to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.840 
I knock that bolt out we're going to
separate<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.550> ball<00:01:03.879> joint<00:01:04.180> from<00:01:04.300> the<00:01:05.850> knuckle

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
separate the ball joint from the knuckle

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.870 
separate the ball joint from the knuckle
now<00:01:07.000> using<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.750> old<00:01:07.870> double<00:01:08.670> pickle<00:01:09.670> fork

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
now using the old double pickle fork

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.710 
now using the old double pickle fork
trick<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.280> quite<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.880> distance<00:01:13.240> that's<00:01:13.420> why<00:01:13.659> you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
trick so quite a distance that's why you

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:38.260 
trick so quite a distance that's why you
need<00:01:13.900> two<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.110> them

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.660 

free<00:01:39.270> free<00:01:42.110> there<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.229> go

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
free free there we go

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.950 
free free there we go

here<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.709> can<00:03:30.860> see<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.190> this<00:03:31.720> ball<00:03:32.720> doing

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
here you can see that this ball doing

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.110 
here you can see that this ball doing
just<00:03:33.080> walled<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.709> chances<00:03:34.700> are<00:03:34.940> this

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
just walled it in there chances are this

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.910 
just walled it in there chances are this
van<00:03:35.569> actually<00:03:35.900> needs<00:03:36.080> new<00:03:36.230> control<00:03:36.590> arm<00:03:36.709> but

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
van actually needs new control arm but

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.080 
van actually needs new control arm but
we're<00:03:37.160> just<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.489> run<00:03:37.670> with<00:03:37.819> what<00:03:37.970> we<00:03:38.060> got

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
we're just going to run with what we got

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.390 
we're just going to run with what we got
for<00:03:38.450> now<00:03:38.650> we'll<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.860> cut<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.160> well

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
for now we'll have to cut this well

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:56.430 
for now we'll have to cut this well
offer<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> seam

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.869 

so<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.830> arm<00:03:57.980> we<00:03:58.159> cut<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.459> weld<00:03:58.670> off

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
so here is the arm we cut the weld off

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.190 
so here is the arm we cut the weld off
to<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.569> point<00:03:59.750> where<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.019> see

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
to the point where you can see

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.830 
to the point where you can see
separation<00:04:00.920> on<00:04:01.069> it<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.599> we're<00:04:02.599> going<00:04:02.750> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
separation on it and we're going to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.930 
separation on it and we're going to
throw<00:04:02.959> on<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.110> ring<00:04:03.319> here<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.860> beat<00:04:04.459> on<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:04.790> so

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
throw on a ring here and beat on it so

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:13.449 
throw on a ring here and beat on it so
you<00:04:05.000> can<00:04:05.090> get<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.299> pop<00:04:05.420> out

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:23.890 

oh<00:04:21.699> here's<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.880> ball<00:04:23.270> joint<00:04:23.479> we<00:04:23.570> took<00:04:23.690> out<00:04:23.870> of

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
oh here's the ball joint we took out of
