00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so right now I'm going to be a changing

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.430 
so right now I'm going to be a changing
oil<00:00:02.939> for<00:00:03.179> my

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
oil for my

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.260 
oil for my
2004<00:00:05.440> Buick<00:00:06.069> Century<00:00:07.019> oil<00:00:08.019> and<00:00:08.530> oil<00:00:09.219> filter<00:00:09.760> so

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.270 
2004 Buick Century oil and oil filter so

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:38.800 
2004 Buick Century oil and oil filter so
have<00:00:10.420> those<00:00:10.600> two<00:00:10.809> ready

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.900 

you

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:01:00.080 

the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.340 

we're<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.540> to<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.690> ahead<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.930> let<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.050> drain

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
we're going to go ahead and let it drain

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.560 
we're going to go ahead and let it drain
for<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.650> couple<00:01:01.860> minutes<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
for a couple minutes and then put in a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.080 
for a couple minutes and then put in a
new<00:01:03.720> one

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.370 

for<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.720> car<00:01:07.049> we're<00:01:07.320> using<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> L<00:01:07.920> 10<00:01:09.380> 111

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
for this car we're using the L 10 111

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.410 
for this car we're using the L 10 111
filter<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.250> whenever<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.880> look<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
filter and whenever you look around the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.139 
filter and whenever you look around the
filter<00:01:12.840> there's<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.950> gasket<00:01:14.640> around<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
filter there's a gasket around there and

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.999 
filter there's a gasket around there and
typically<00:01:15.539> what<00:01:15.720> we'll<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.110> we'll<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
typically what we'll do is we'll take a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.630 
typically what we'll do is we'll take a
little<00:01:17.310> bit<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.930> oil<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.500> lubricate<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
little bit of oil and then lubricate the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.499 
little bit of oil and then lubricate the
gasket<00:01:22.130> portion<00:01:23.130> around<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.670> around<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.390> so

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
gasket portion around here around it so

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
gasket portion around here around it so
the<00:01:24.630> next<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.929> take<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.679> little

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the next one take it out it's a little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
the next one take it out it's a little
bit<00:01:25.920> easier<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.179> to<00:01:27.270> make

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
bit easier and then you're going to make

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.639 
bit easier and then you're going to make
sure<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.720> take<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> oil<00:01:28.140> filter<00:01:28.380> out

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
sure when you take the oil filter out

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.600 
sure when you take the oil filter out
that<00:01:29.899> under<00:01:30.899> car<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> ring<00:01:32.189> isn't

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that under car that that ring isn't

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
that under car that that ring isn't
stuck<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.179> car<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.840> definitely<00:01:34.380> check

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
stuck on the car so definitely check

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.440 
stuck on the car so definitely check
that<00:01:34.860> out

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.620 

and<00:01:37.659> typically<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.470> can<00:01:38.619> also<00:01:38.770> pour<00:01:39.630> oil

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
and typically you can also pour oil

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.649 
and typically you can also pour oil
inside<00:01:41.290> there<00:01:41.619> as<00:01:42.040> well

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:02:01.060 

then<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.750> go<00:01:46.869> ahead<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.170> reinstall<00:01:47.409> it

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.480 

so<00:02:01.700> after<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:02.390> tight<00:02:03.110> you<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.100> want<00:02:04.310> give

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
so after it's tight you just want give

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.510 
so after it's tight you just want give
it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
it
a<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:05.820> quarter<00:02:06.119> turn<00:02:06.390> that's<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.260 

we<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.159> a<00:02:11.190> four<00:02:11.790> ports<00:02:12.299> so<00:02:12.840> one<00:02:13.709> two<00:02:14.549> three

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
we need a four ports so one two three

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.050 
we need a four ports so one two three
8:4<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.620> basically<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.130> all<00:02:17.250> ions<00:02:17.550> around<00:02:17.670> here

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
8:4 so basically to all ions around here

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:32.900 
8:4 so basically to all ions around here
then<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.450> check<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.750> oil

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.580 

so<00:02:33.910> right<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:34.510> we're<00:02:34.780> almost<00:02:34.930> about<00:02:35.230> four

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
so right now we're almost about four

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.920 
so right now we're almost about four
quarts<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.280> we're<00:02:37.210> going<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.420> double<00:02:37.630> check<00:02:37.690> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
quarts so we're going to double check to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.020 
quarts so we're going to double check to
see<00:02:38.050> how<00:02:38.290> much<00:02:38.470> more<00:02:38.710> we<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.520> but

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
see how much more we have in here but

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.540 
see how much more we have in here but
before<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.630> I'm<00:02:41.230> going<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.530> start<00:02:42.490> up

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
before I do that I'm going to start up

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.580 
before I do that I'm going to start up
the<00:02:42.670> car<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.060> run<00:02:43.390> for<00:02:43.660> five<00:02:43.990> seconds

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the car that run for five seconds

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.340 
the car that run for five seconds
and<00:02:44.770> turn<00:02:45.040> off<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:46.000> engine<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.870> oil

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
and turn off the engine so that the oil

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.930 
and turn off the engine so that the oil
will<00:02:47.590> go<00:02:47.770> through<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.040> filter

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.350 

it's

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.720 

yeah<00:03:02.360> that's<00:03:02.540> good
