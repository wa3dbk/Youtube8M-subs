so got a 50/50 shot here we go so you
can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.430 

well<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.160> not<00:00:49.610> pain<00:00:50.570> free<00:00:52.930> it's<00:00:53.930> not<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
well it's not pain free it's not the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.380 
well it's not pain free it's not the
worst<00:00:54.770> pain<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:55.430> felt<00:00:55.640> as<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.120> can<00:00:56.240> see

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
worst pain that I felt as you can see

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.670 
worst pain that I felt as you can see
these<00:00:56.570> are<00:00:56.750> metal<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.230> they're<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.380> lot<00:00:57.530> heavier

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
these are metal so they're a lot heavier

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.970 
these are metal so they're a lot heavier
I'm<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.460> attempt<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.970> put<00:00:59.240> the<00:00:59.420> plugs<00:00:59.660> in

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
I'm going to attempt to put the plugs in

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.040 
I'm going to attempt to put the plugs in
these<00:01:00.980> are<00:01:01.160> hollow<00:01:01.400> as<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.480> can<00:01:02.600> see<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:02.960> don't

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
these are hollow as you can see I don't

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.380 
these are hollow as you can see I don't
know<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.290> can<00:01:03.440> see<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.150> they<00:01:05.150> have

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
know if you can see that and they have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.280 
know if you can see that and they have
like<00:01:05.600> a<00:01:05.630> wider<00:01:06.530> edge<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.190> I<00:01:07.250> hold<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.550> sideways

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
like a wider edge if I hold it sideways

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.380 
like a wider edge if I hold it sideways
it's<00:01:09.290> like<00:01:09.410> a<00:01:09.470> wider<00:01:09.680> edge<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.160> one<00:01:10.190> side<00:01:10.730> so

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
it's like a wider edge on one side so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.490 
it's like a wider edge on one side so
hopefully<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.960> will<00:01:12.050> just<00:01:12.170> push<00:01:12.380> right

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
hopefully this will just push right

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.830 
hopefully this will just push right
through<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.160> then<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.490> way<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:14.090> only<00:01:14.390> need

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
through and then that way I only need

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:28.740 
through and then that way I only need
the<00:01:14.960> back<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.350> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.350 

always<00:01:29.530> start<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.890> Battier<00:01:30.360> because

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
always start with the Battier because

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.480 
always start with the Battier because
then<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.810> second<00:01:32.140> time<00:01:32.260> around<00:01:32.290> doesn't<00:01:33.220> seem

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
then the second time around doesn't seem

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.080 
then the second time around doesn't seem
as<00:01:33.610> bad<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:35.550> turned<00:01:36.550> this<00:01:36.670> way

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
as bad I turned this way

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.050 
as bad I turned this way
oh<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:39.510> well<00:01:40.510> then<00:01:40.870> I<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:42.460> wasn't<00:01:42.700> expecting

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
oh but well then I kind wasn't expecting

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.410 
oh but well then I kind wasn't expecting
it<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.180> go<00:01:43.300> in<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.540> fast<00:01:44.550> ha<00:01:45.550> ha<00:01:45.729> ha<00:01:46.180> Hertz<00:01:48.390> Wow

I don't read my ears on this one little

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.790 
I don't read my ears on this one little
tricky<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:53.020> those<00:01:53.140> suckers<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.530> though

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
tricky to get those suckers in though

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.410 
tricky to get those suckers in though
I'm<00:01:53.890> not<00:01:54.040> used<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.460> using<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.910> tunnel<00:01:55.300> right

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
I'm not used to using a tunnel right

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
away all right

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.090 
away all right
so<00:01:58.150> got<00:01:58.570> them<00:01:58.690> both<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.050> see<00:01:59.770> you<00:01:59.860> through<00:02:00.010> him

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so got them both in see you through him

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.370 
so got them both in see you through him
a<00:02:00.130> little<00:02:00.340> bit<00:02:00.430> I<00:02:00.720> was<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.780> little<00:02:01.990> bit<00:02:02.080> easier<00:02:02.200> I

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
a little bit I was a little bit easier I

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.480 
a little bit I was a little bit easier I
think<00:02:02.410> I'm<00:02:02.649> starting<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:02.979> get<00:02:03.070> used<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.369> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
think I'm starting to get used to the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.070 
think I'm starting to get used to the
pain<00:02:03.670> because<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.090> really<00:02:04.630> hurts<00:02:04.840> right<00:02:04.960> now

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
pain because it really hurts right now

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.260 
pain because it really hurts right now
but<00:02:05.229> I'm<00:02:05.530> not<00:02:05.710> as<00:02:05.950> affected<00:02:06.670> by<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.850> as<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.119> was

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
but I'm not as affected by it as I was

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.330 
but I'm not as affected by it as I was
the<00:02:07.390> first<00:02:07.570> few<00:02:07.750> times<00:02:07.920> um<00:02:08.920> definitely

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
the first few times um definitely

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.729 
the first few times um definitely
feeling<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.880> burning<00:02:10.209> stinging<00:02:10.750> sensation<00:02:11.110> but

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
feeling a burning stinging sensation but

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.310 
feeling a burning stinging sensation but
it's<00:02:11.860> definitely<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:13.020> guess<00:02:14.020> I'm<00:02:14.200> just

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
it's definitely like I guess I'm just

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.350 
it's definitely like I guess I'm just
used<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.310> doesn't<00:02:15.550> bother<00:02:15.790> me<00:02:15.940> as

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
used to it and it doesn't bother me as

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.110 
used to it and it doesn't bother me as
much<00:02:16.390> which<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.959> guess<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.140> good<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> now<00:02:19.060> for

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
much which is I guess is good so now for

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.400 
much which is I guess is good so now for
a<00:02:19.390> little<00:02:19.570> bit<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.810> different<00:02:20.200> subject

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
a little bit of a different subject

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.500 
a little bit of a different subject
