for<00:00:00.390> years<00:00:00.659> I've<00:00:01.199> heard<00:00:01.500> Christians<00:00:02.040> struggle

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
for years I've heard Christians struggle

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.560 
for years I've heard Christians struggle
with<00:00:02.520> explaining<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> doctrine<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.540> the

with explaining the doctrine of the
Trinity<00:00:03.990> likewise<00:00:04.950> I've<00:00:05.250> heard<00:00:05.700> atheists<00:00:06.270> and

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
Trinity likewise I've heard atheists and

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.270 
Trinity likewise I've heard atheists and
people<00:00:06.839> who<00:00:06.930> believe<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.410> Unitarian<00:00:08.010> God

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
people who believe in a Unitarian God

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.910 
people who believe in a Unitarian God
attacked<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.150> Trinity<00:00:09.510> as<00:00:09.660> confusing<00:00:10.590> it

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
attacked the Trinity as confusing it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.820 
attacked the Trinity as confusing it
logical<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.660> polytheistic<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:13.440> often

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
logical and polytheistic they often

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
logical and polytheistic they often
bring<00:00:13.950> up<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> idea<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.700> God<00:00:14.940> being<00:00:14.969> Jesus<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
bring up the idea of God being Jesus and

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.769 
bring up the idea of God being Jesus and
the<00:00:16.410> father<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.580> Holy<00:00:17.609> Spirit<00:00:17.970> yet<00:00:18.570> all

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the father and the Holy Spirit yet all

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.800 
the father and the Holy Spirit yet all
one<00:00:19.020> being<00:00:19.289> doesn't<00:00:19.949> seem<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> make<00:00:20.520> sense

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
one being doesn't seem to make sense

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.660 
one being doesn't seem to make sense
when<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.840> was<00:00:22.050> agnostic<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.949> Trinity<00:00:23.340> didn't

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
when I was agnostic the Trinity didn't

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.040 
when I was agnostic the Trinity didn't
make<00:00:23.789> much<00:00:24.000> sense<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> me<00:00:24.480> either

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
make much sense to me either

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.929 
make much sense to me either
that<00:00:25.619> was<00:00:25.830> until<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.130> actually<00:00:26.340> studied<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that was until I actually studied the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.609 
that was until I actually studied the
concept<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> Trinity<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
concept of the Trinity and the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.790 
concept of the Trinity and the
attributes<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.160> God<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.779> research<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.080> saw<00:00:31.650> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
attributes of God in research I saw that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.229 
attributes of God in research I saw that
the<00:00:31.920> Trinity<00:00:32.099> did<00:00:32.489> make<00:00:32.730> sense

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the Trinity did make sense

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.360 
the Trinity did make sense
but<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> also<00:00:34.020> discovered<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> existence

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
but I also discovered that the existence

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
but I also discovered that the existence
of<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.550> Unitarian<00:00:36.120> God<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.649> actually<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of a Unitarian God is actually the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.100 
of a Unitarian God is actually the
concept<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> illogical<00:00:39.079> only<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
concept that is illogical only a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
concept that is illogical only a
Trinitarian<00:00:40.890> God<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.340> account<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
Trinitarian God can account for the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
Trinitarian God can account for the
unique<00:00:42.210> attributes<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:43.170> make<00:00:43.469> God<00:00:43.770> who<00:00:43.980> he

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
unique attributes then make God who he

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.799 
unique attributes then make God who he
is

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
is

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
is
first<00:00:45.809> let<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:46.590> start<00:00:46.890> by<00:00:46.950> saying<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.670> doctor

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
first let me start by saying the doctor

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
first let me start by saying the doctor
in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> Trinity<00:00:48.600> begins<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> belief

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
in the Trinity begins with the belief

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
in the Trinity begins with the belief
that<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.550> true<00:00:50.820> God<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.449> totally

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that the true God is not totally

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
that the true God is not totally
comprehensible<00:00:52.620> any<00:00:52.890> God<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.940> could<00:00:54.090> fully

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
comprehensible any God we could fully

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
comprehensible any God we could fully
understand<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:54.960> explain<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> Unitarian

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
understand and explain like a Unitarian

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880 
understand and explain like a Unitarian
God<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.629> an<00:00:57.719> entity<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.680> no

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
God would be an entity that is no

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
God would be an entity that is no
greater<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:01.010> Unitarian

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
greater than what we are a Unitarian

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
greater than what we are a Unitarian
once<00:01:02.250> told<00:01:02.489> me<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.030> God<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> spirit

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
once told me that God was just a spirit

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
once told me that God was just a spirit
well<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.979> God<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> spirit<00:01:06.060> he<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.600> be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
well if God is just a spirit he would be

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.899 
well if God is just a spirit he would be
no<00:01:06.900> greater<00:01:07.200> than<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> Angels<00:01:07.920> since<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.760> as

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
no greater than the Angels since that as

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
no greater than the Angels since that as
all<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> angels<00:01:09.540> are<00:01:09.920> Lucifer<00:01:10.920> may<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.280> had

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
all the angels are Lucifer may have had

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
all the angels are Lucifer may have had
a<00:01:11.460> chance<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> war<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.330> heaven<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.900> God<00:01:13.320> was

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
a chance in the war in heaven if God was

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
a chance in the war in heaven if God was
just<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.740> Unitarian<00:01:14.310> spirit<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.390> God<00:01:15.659> will

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
just a Unitarian spirit because God will

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
just a Unitarian spirit because God will
be<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.290> level<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.710> Lucifer<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.880> God

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
be on the same level as Lucifer but God

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
be on the same level as Lucifer but God
created<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> angels<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.380> he<00:01:19.500> must<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.920> more

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
created the angels so he must be more

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
created the angels so he must be more
than<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.610> spirit<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:22.740> learn

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
than just a spirit so how can we learn

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.370 
than just a spirit so how can we learn
who<00:01:23.100> God<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.420> by<00:01:24.420> simply<00:01:24.869> studying<00:01:25.259> his

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
who God is by simply studying his

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
who God is by simply studying his
attributes<00:01:26.060> every<00:01:27.060> monotheistic<00:01:27.840> religion

attributes every monotheistic religion

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
attributes every monotheistic religion
claims<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> God<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.100> omniscient<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:30.299> if

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
claims that God is omniscient well if

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
claims that God is omniscient well if
God<00:01:30.450> knows<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:31.770> must<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> able<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
God knows all then he must be able to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
God knows all then he must be able to
see<00:01:32.610> everything<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.900> God<00:01:34.079> sees

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
see everything and if God sees

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.200 
see everything and if God sees
everything<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.189> he<00:01:35.220> must<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.610> everywhere<00:01:36.060> at

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everything then he must be everywhere at

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
everything then he must be everywhere at
once<00:01:36.240> which<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.200> make<00:01:37.380> God<00:01:37.700> omnipresent

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
once which would make God omnipresent

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.539 
once which would make God omnipresent
now<00:01:39.509> God<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.840> omnipresent<00:01:40.409> he<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
now God is omnipresent he would have to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
now God is omnipresent he would have to
be<00:01:41.670> greater<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.360> dimensions<00:01:42.479> because

well if you're going to take the Bible's

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.870 
well if you're going to take the Bible's
word<00:02:17.760> then<00:02:18.360> he<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.630> infinitely<00:02:19.170> dimensional

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
word then he is infinitely dimensional

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480 
word then he is infinitely dimensional
isaiah<00:02:20.880> 40:28<00:02:21.720> says<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.920> Lord<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> the

he<00:02:26.910> never<00:02:27.180> grows<00:02:27.510> weak<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:28.020> weary<00:02:28.560> no<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.580> can

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
he never grows weak or weary no one can

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.580 
he never grows weak or weary no one can
measure<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.240> depths<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.750> his<00:02:30.840> understanding

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
measure the depths of his understanding

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.160 
measure the depths of his understanding
so<00:02:32.460> what<00:02:32.610> does<00:02:32.790> God<00:02:33.000> being<00:02:33.240> hyperdimensional

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so what does God being hyperdimensional

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.680 
so what does God being hyperdimensional
have<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.710> do<00:02:34.830> with<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> Trinity<00:02:35.420> will<00:02:36.420> allow

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
have to do with the Trinity will allow

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.670 
have to do with the Trinity will allow
me<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.020> explain

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
me to explain

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.190 
me to explain
hyper<00:02:38.520> dimensions<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.360> not<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.050> make

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
hyper dimensions are not going to make

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.590 
hyper dimensions are not going to make
sense<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.650> our<00:02:40.680> finite<00:02:41.130> minds<00:02:41.600> however

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
sense to our finite minds however

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.260 
sense to our finite minds however
luckily<00:02:42.930> we<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.770> explain<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.460> using<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
luckily we can explain this using the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.450 
luckily we can explain this using the
example<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> taking<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.230> cube<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.800> trying<00:02:47.340> to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
translate into a two-dimensional world

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
translate into a two-dimensional world
take<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> look<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.880> cube<00:02:51.210> because<00:02:51.990> we

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
take a look at this cube because we

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.900 
take a look at this cube because we
understand<00:02:52.620> three<00:02:52.860> dimensions<00:02:53.370> we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
understand three dimensions we

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
understand three dimensions we
understand<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.510> spatial<00:02:54.750> parameters<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
understand the spatial parameters of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.890 
understand the spatial parameters of
this<00:02:55.650> cube<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.910> if<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.120> were<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.390> encounter<00:02:57.630> of

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this cube but if we were to encounter of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.450 
this cube but if we were to encounter of
being<00:02:58.080> living<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> two-dimensional<00:02:59.280> world

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
being living in a two-dimensional world

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.400 
being living in a two-dimensional world
he<00:03:00.000> wouldn't<00:03:00.300> understand<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.870> cube<00:03:01.140> at<00:03:01.260> all

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
he wouldn't understand this cube at all

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620 
he wouldn't understand this cube at all
he<00:03:02.100> would<00:03:02.220> look<00:03:02.370> at<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.790> see<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
he would look at it and see it as just a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.290 
he would look at it and see it as just a
square<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:05.250> could<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:05.580> try<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.880> show<00:03:06.120> him

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
square we could then try to show him

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.750 
square we could then try to show him
that<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.630> actually<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.230> cube<00:03:07.590> by<00:03:08.220> turning<00:03:08.670> it

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
that it is actually a cube by turning it

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.210 
that it is actually a cube by turning it
to<00:03:08.880> show<00:03:09.060> him<00:03:09.180> another<00:03:09.390> side<00:03:09.800> but<00:03:10.800> his<00:03:10.920> mind

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
to show him another side but his mind

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.770 
to show him another side but his mind
could<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.490> comprehend<00:03:11.880> changes<00:03:12.510> made<00:03:12.660> in

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
could not comprehend changes made in

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.350 
could not comprehend changes made in
three<00:03:12.960> dimensional<00:03:13.440> space<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.700> him<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
three dimensional space so to him the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
three dimensional space so to him the
change<00:03:15.660> would<00:03:15.810> look<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.100> green

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
change would look like this the green

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.280 
change would look like this the green
square<00:03:17.700> disappearing<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.930> red<00:03:19.080> square

appearing the two dimensional being

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.300 
appearing the two dimensional being
would<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.780> say<00:03:22.050> hey<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:23.010> different

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
would then say hey that's a different

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.000 
would then say hey that's a different
cube<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:24.360> would<00:03:24.510> say<00:03:24.750> no<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.260> still<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.800> same

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
cube we would say no it's still the same

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.730 
cube we would say no it's still the same
cube<00:03:26.310> he<00:03:27.210> would<00:03:27.390> say<00:03:27.600> no<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.140> can't<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.470> right

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
cube he would say no that can't be right

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.460 
cube he would say no that can't be right
because<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.370> see<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> different<00:03:30.090> Square<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.660> we

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
because I see a different Square and we

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
because I see a different Square and we
would<00:03:31.620> say<00:03:31.890> well<00:03:32.280> yeah<00:03:32.520> it's<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.850> different

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
would say well yeah it's a different

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.150 
would say well yeah it's a different
square<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:34.170> it's<00:03:34.290> still<00:03:34.500> part<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.920> same

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
square but it's still part of the same

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.940 
square but it's still part of the same
cube<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:36.630> could<00:03:36.810> then<00:03:36.990> show<00:03:37.200> him<00:03:37.320> all<00:03:37.500> sides<00:03:37.800> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
cube we could then show him all sides of

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.650 
cube we could then show him all sides of
the<00:03:38.070> cube<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.490> tell<00:03:38.970> him<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.210> all<00:03:39.330> six

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the cube and tell him that all six

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.949 
the cube and tell him that all six
squares<00:03:39.960> he<00:03:40.110> saw<00:03:40.320> were<00:03:40.800> all<00:03:41.070> one<00:03:41.400> cube<00:03:41.760> yet<00:03:42.750> all

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
squares he saw were all one cube yet all

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.960 
squares he saw were all one cube yet all
we<00:03:43.140> would<00:03:43.320> see<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.650> six<00:03:43.950> squares<00:03:44.250> disappearing

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
we would see is six squares disappearing

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.449 
we would see is six squares disappearing
and<00:03:45.090> appearing<00:03:45.480> before<00:03:45.990> him<00:03:46.200> he<00:03:47.160> would<00:03:47.310> not

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
and appearing before him he would not

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.160 
and appearing before him he would not
see<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> cube<00:03:48.000> rotating<00:03:48.540> from<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:48.900> side<00:03:49.140> to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
see the cube rotating from one side to

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.260 
see the cube rotating from one side to
the<00:03:49.320> other<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.310> he<00:03:50.430> would<00:03:50.580> not<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> cube

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
the other so he would not see the cube

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.120 
the other so he would not see the cube
in<00:03:51.360> its<00:03:51.480> entirety<00:03:51.870> or<00:03:52.200> be<00:03:52.590> able<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.860> imagine

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
in its entirety or be able to imagine

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.860 
in its entirety or be able to imagine
the<00:03:53.340> physics<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.030> shape<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> cube

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
the physics and the shape of the cube

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.990 
the physics and the shape of the cube
because<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.709> exists<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.310> higher<00:03:56.459> dimension

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
because it exists in a higher dimension

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.620 
because it exists in a higher dimension
than<00:03:57.120> he<00:03:57.240> does

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
than he does

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.500 
than he does
all<00:03:58.410> he<00:03:58.740> could<00:03:58.920> do<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.070> trust<00:03:59.430> our<00:03:59.670> word<00:03:59.910> that

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
all he could do is trust our word that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.360 
all he could do is trust our word that
the<00:04:00.660> six<00:04:00.959> separate<00:04:01.410> squares<00:04:01.800> he<00:04:01.950> saw<00:04:02.130> are

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
the six separate squares he saw are

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.490 
the six separate squares he saw are
actually<00:04:03.120> part<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.420> one<00:04:03.570> object<00:04:03.720> called<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
actually part of one object called a

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.860 
actually part of one object called a
cube<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.300> starting<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.690> sound

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
cube so is this starting to sound

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.680 
cube so is this starting to sound
familiar<00:04:07.340> this<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.400> exactly<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.300> same<00:04:09.480> way

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
familiar this is exactly the same way

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.470 
familiar this is exactly the same way
God<00:04:09.930> tries<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.380> explain<00:04:10.740> himself<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.190> us

God tries to explain himself to us

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.870 
God tries to explain himself to us
clearly<00:04:12.480> he<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:12.959> omnipresent<00:04:13.520> meaning<00:04:14.520> he<00:04:14.850> is

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
clearly he is omnipresent meaning he is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.699 
clearly he is omnipresent meaning he is

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
where the physics allow beings to be

more than one person

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.670 
more than one person
yet<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.389> are<00:04:27.419> still<00:04:27.750> thinking<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.260> terms<00:04:28.290> of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
yet we are still thinking in terms of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.129 
yet we are still thinking in terms of
three-dimensional<00:04:29.370> laws<00:04:29.570> where<00:04:30.570> all<00:04:30.750> beings

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
three-dimensional laws where all beings

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.540 
three-dimensional laws where all beings
must<00:04:31.410> only<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.740> one<00:04:32.040> person

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
must only be one person

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.460 
must only be one person
but<00:04:33.270> since<00:04:33.510> God<00:04:33.720> is<00:04:33.870> beyond<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.290> third

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
but since God is beyond the third

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.080 
but since God is beyond the third
dimension<00:04:34.680> he<00:04:35.340> would<00:04:35.460> have<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:35.850> greater

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
dimension he would have to be greater

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.270 
dimension he would have to be greater
than<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.449> meaning<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.650> would<00:04:37.740> only<00:04:37.949> make<00:04:38.220> sense

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
than it meaning it would only make sense

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.950 
than it meaning it would only make sense
for<00:04:38.669> him<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:38.910> more<00:04:39.150> than<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.330> Unitarian

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
for him to be more than a Unitarian

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.460 
for him to be more than a Unitarian
being<00:04:40.229> like<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:41.449> now<00:04:42.449> how<00:04:42.630> monumental<00:04:43.320> is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
being like we are now how monumental is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.040 
being like we are now how monumental is
this<00:04:43.680> well<00:04:44.550> two<00:04:44.729> thousand<00:04:45.180> years<00:04:45.360> ago<00:04:45.479> they

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
this well two thousand years ago they

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.300 
this well two thousand years ago they
didn't<00:04:46.350> have<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.620> science<00:04:47.010> of<00:04:47.130> hyper

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.210 
didn't have the science of hyper
dimensions<00:04:47.850> like<00:04:48.270> we<00:04:48.419> do<00:04:48.540> today<00:04:48.979> so<00:04:49.979> they<00:04:50.100> came

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
dimensions like we do today so they came

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.980 
dimensions like we do today so they came
up<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.580> term<00:04:50.760> Trinity<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.720> try<00:04:51.930> to

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
up with the term Trinity to try to

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.659 
up with the term Trinity to try to
explain<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> world<00:04:52.650> what<00:04:53.280> God<00:04:53.490> had<00:04:53.610> told

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
explain to the world what God had told

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.830 
explain to the world what God had told
us<00:04:53.940> about<00:04:54.060> himself

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
us about himself

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.800 
us about himself
this<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.889> absolutely<00:04:56.610> monumental<00:04:57.000> because

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
this is absolutely monumental because

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.200 
this is absolutely monumental because
when<00:04:58.110> man<00:04:58.320> makes<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.710> a<00:04:58.830> religion<00:04:59.280> he<00:04:59.850> makes<00:05:00.090> up

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
when man makes up a religion he makes up

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.460 
when man makes up a religion he makes up
a<00:05:00.300> God<00:05:00.510> he<00:05:00.600> can<00:05:00.750> understand<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.320> make<00:05:01.440> sense

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
a God he can understand and make sense

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.580 
a God he can understand and make sense
of<00:05:02.180> only<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.389> Bible<00:05:03.750> do<00:05:03.990> we<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> God

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
of only in the Bible do we see a God
