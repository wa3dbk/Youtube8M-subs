batteries in some cases like that one
the<00:01:04.080> batteries<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.739> work<00:01:04.920> brake<00:01:05.729> levers

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
the batteries even work brake levers

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.980 
the batteries even work brake levers
here<00:01:06.680> gear<00:01:07.680> levers<00:01:08.300> some<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.479> perfectly

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
here gear levers some of them perfectly

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.419 
here gear levers some of them perfectly
right<00:01:10.319> and<00:01:10.679> an<00:01:11.640> easy<00:01:12.149> then<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:13.440> to<00:01:13.710> fit<00:01:14.310> on
