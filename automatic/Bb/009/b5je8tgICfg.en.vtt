00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.849
 peggy 18 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.260
 LOL 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.300
 Napoleon you do not have the least pint 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.610
 from revolutionary mad 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.720
 although the hood gives you a touch 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.720
 sinister if you allow me 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.940
 Sometimes I find it hard to remember how easy it is 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 it was life 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.720
 before the world will change 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.730
 the revolution the people say in the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.129
 those who dare to fight 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.129
 they end up in prison or dead 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.320
 what is this to hell 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.690
 only bayonets stop us 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.149
 life that he had left was your father was a 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.180
 murderer and the world that he knew went away 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.390
 with her nobody gave her life fighting for 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.640
 the freedom of humanity 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.880
 You are seen to walk the path of 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.880
 air 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.450
 above 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.640
 but between violence and chaos 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.190
 vote and count completed in the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 master the king has to die I will find 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.800
 justice and honest father cost what 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.710
 cost 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.600
 for that reason I joined the brotherhood and not 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.750
 for revenge for redemption 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.150

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.770
 salt brands 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.540

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.390
 brotherhood we can together 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.280

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.050
 conspiracy intrigue 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.050
