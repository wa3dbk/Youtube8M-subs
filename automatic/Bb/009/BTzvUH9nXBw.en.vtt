00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
so in the audio urban intelligent does

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.629 
so in the audio urban intelligent does
this<00:00:13.180> project<00:00:13.840> we're<00:00:14.049> trying<00:00:14.350> to<00:00:14.590> come<00:00:15.250> up<00:00:15.280> and

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
this project we're trying to come up and

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.429 
this project we're trying to come up and
develop<00:00:16.059> a<00:00:16.150> vision<00:00:16.330> of<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.840> urban<00:00:17.260> mobility

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439

in<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.400> future<00:00:18.759> for<00:00:19.000> audi<00:00:19.540> customers<00:00:20.230> so

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
in the future for audi customers so

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.609 
in the future for audi customers so
we're<00:00:21.130> trying<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.580> come<00:00:21.820> up<00:00:21.849> with<00:00:22.029> new

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
we're trying to come up with new

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.900 
we're trying to come up with new
assistant<00:00:23.619> systems<00:00:24.070> and<00:00:24.340> navigation

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
assistant systems and navigation

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.670 
assistant systems and navigation
solutions<00:00:25.540> that<00:00:25.720> will<00:00:25.840> help<00:00:26.110> our<00:00:26.380> customers

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
solutions that will help our customers

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.790 
solutions that will help our customers
to<00:00:27.300> navigate<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.899> urban<00:00:29.230> jungle<00:00:29.259> in<00:00:29.710> the

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
to navigate to the urban jungle in the

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:53.200 
to navigate to the urban jungle in the
future

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.760 

so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.690> volkswagen<00:00:55.500> group<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so I think the volkswagen group of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
so I think the volkswagen group of
America<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.700> excited<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.329> also<00:00:57.600> proud

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
America is really excited and also proud

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
America is really excited and also proud

with<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> harness<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.460> lot<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.000> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
with them and harness a lot of that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
with them and harness a lot of that
potential<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> new<00:01:10.080> ideas<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
potential and new ideas that we see here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.420 
potential and new ideas that we see here
and<00:01:11.840> bring<00:01:12.840> part<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.860> research

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and bring part of that into our research

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.730 
and bring part of that into our research
and<00:01:14.610> hopefully<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.300> new<00:01:16.110> products<00:01:16.650> for

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and hopefully into new products for

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
and hopefully into new products for
hourly<00:01:17.220> customers<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> future<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.570> see

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
hourly customers in the future so we see

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
hourly customers in the future so we see
a<00:01:18.780> lot<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> potential<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.680> interesting<00:01:20.250> ideas

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
a lot of potential and interesting ideas

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
a lot of potential and interesting ideas
being<00:01:21.360> generated<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.320> California<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
being generated here in California and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.210 
being generated here in California and
we<00:01:23.190> see<00:01:23.399> this<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.820> new<00:01:24.240> wave<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.220> technology

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
we see this as a new wave of technology

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.889 
we see this as a new wave of technology
coming<00:01:26.729> into<00:01:27.030> our<00:01:27.060> vehicles<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.660> that's<00:01:27.780> why

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
coming into our vehicles and that's why

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:48.920 
coming into our vehicles and that's why
we<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> tap<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:28.890> source

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.700 

well<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.190> whole<00:01:50.670> initiative<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.710> spread

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
well the the whole initiative is spread

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
well the the whole initiative is spread
out<00:01:52.740> over<00:01:52.920> three<00:01:53.310> years<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.450> are<00:01:54.540> kind<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
out over three years so we are kind of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.730 
out over three years so we are kind of
at<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> beginning<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.220> first<00:01:56.490> year<00:01:56.910> and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
at the beginning of the first year and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
at the beginning of the first year and
over<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.070> course<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.910> next<00:02:00.090> two<00:02:00.360> years

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
over the course of the next two years

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.930 
over the course of the next two years
we're<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.320> help<00:02:01.950> develop<00:02:02.760> those

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
we're going to help develop those

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.910 
we're going to help develop those
applications<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.260> universities<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
applications of the universities and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.790 
applications of the universities and
hopefully<00:02:05.460> maybe<00:02:06.240> sometime<00:02:06.690> next<00:02:06.990> year<00:02:07.410> or

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
hopefully maybe sometime next year or

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.220 
hopefully maybe sometime next year or
early<00:02:08.570> 2013<00:02:09.570> we<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.289> see<00:02:10.470> some<00:02:10.500> results<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
early 2013 we will see some results and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.120 
early 2013 we will see some results and
present<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.440> our<00:02:13.650> colleagues<00:02:14.040> in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
present that to our colleagues in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.320 
present that to our colleagues in
Germany<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.640> hopefully<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.060> good

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
Germany and hopefully get some good

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:37.809
