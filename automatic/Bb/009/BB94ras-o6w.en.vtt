00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.380 
okay and I didn't do this section quite
as<00:05:09.530> neat<00:05:09.770> as<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.130> would<00:05:10.520> normally<00:05:10.730> feel<00:05:11.120> once

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
as neat as I would normally feel once

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.980 
as neat as I would normally feel once
I've<00:05:11.720> had<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.260> two<00:05:12.470> pieces<00:05:12.830> in<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.040> back

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
I've had the two pieces in the back

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.570 
I've had the two pieces in the back
braid<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.110> all<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.290> way<00:05:15.500> down<00:05:15.530> basically<00:05:16.430> what

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
braid it all the way down basically what

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:28.870 
braid it all the way down basically what
I<00:05:16.610> do<00:05:16.730> is<00:05:17.740> take<00:05:18.740> them<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:21.340> twist<00:05:22.340> them<00:05:27.880> and

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
I do is take them and twist them and

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:50.620 
I do is take them and twist them and
then<00:05:29.060> in<00:05:29.270> size

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.990 

okay<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:51.690> this<00:05:52.020> is<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.230> final<00:05:52.410> result<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:53.310> I

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
okay so this is the final result and I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.840 
okay so this is the final result and I
think<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> looks<00:05:55.050> really<00:05:55.230> really<00:05:55.350> great<00:05:55.850> this

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
think it looks really really great this

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.250 
think it looks really really great this
would<00:05:57.090> be<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.240> really<00:05:57.480> good<00:05:57.570> option<00:05:57.810> for<00:05:58.140> those

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
would be a really good option for those

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.410 
would be a really good option for those
of<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:58.560> who<00:05:58.710> try<00:05:58.980> to<00:05:59.040> do<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.520> connecting<00:06:00.150> one

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
of you who try to do the connecting one

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.740 
of you who try to do the connecting one
big<00:06:00.630> circle<00:06:01.430> brand<00:06:02.430> crown<00:06:02.730> this<00:06:03.360> is<00:06:03.420> another

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
big circle brand crown this is another

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.250 
big circle brand crown this is another
way<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.050> get<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.470> same<00:06:04.890> sort<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.310> look<00:06:06.260> but

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
way to get that same sort of look but

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.590 
way to get that same sort of look but
you<00:06:07.410> don't<00:06:07.440> have<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.860> quite<00:06:08.100> turn<00:06:09.000> your<00:06:09.180> hands

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
you don't have to quite turn your hands

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.470 
you don't have to quite turn your hands
and<00:06:09.780> you<00:06:10.350> know<00:06:10.470> complicated<00:06:10.950> as<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:12.300> circle

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
and you know complicated as this circle

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.390 
and you know complicated as this circle
would<00:06:12.810> be<00:06:12.930> and<00:06:13.170> then<00:06:13.380> to<00:06:13.710> preserve<00:06:14.070> this<00:06:14.190> bond

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
would be and then to preserve this bond

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.130 
would be and then to preserve this bond
I<00:06:14.430> usually<00:06:14.910> wear<00:06:15.060> it<00:06:15.120> for<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.270> couple<00:06:15.510> of<00:06:15.570> days<00:06:15.750> I

would just spray it with a spray
moisturizer<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.980> then<00:06:20.070> follow<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.460> up<00:06:20.520> with
