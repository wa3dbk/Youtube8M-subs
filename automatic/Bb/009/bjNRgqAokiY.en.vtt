out I'm going to show you today how it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.160 
out I'm going to show you today how it
how<00:00:37.230> compresses<00:00:38.180> how<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> doesn't<00:00:39.719> stretch

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
how compresses how it doesn't stretch

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.799 
how compresses how it doesn't stretch
really<00:00:40.700> how<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.820> handles<00:00:42.420> impact<00:00:44.690> how<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
really how it handles impact how it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
really how it handles impact how it
might<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.020> suitable<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.649> your<00:00:47.070> next<00:00:47.340> project

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.569 
be flexible and strong this is a perfect
new<00:00:55.590> material<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.280> new

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
new material for you our new

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
new material for you our new
elasto-plastic<00:00:57.079> we're<00:00:58.079> super<00:00:58.320> excited<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
elasto-plastic we're super excited to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.080 
elasto-plastic we're super excited to
have<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.070> tested<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.789> us

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
have you tested out for us

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
have you tested out for us
so<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.140> materials<00:01:01.530> made<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> similar<00:01:02.100> way

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so this materials made in a similar way

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.479 
so this materials made in a similar way
to<00:01:02.399> existing<00:01:03.559> laser<00:01:04.559> sintered<00:01:04.920> nylon<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to existing laser sintered nylon so it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.340 
to existing laser sintered nylon so it's
a<00:01:05.549> laser<00:01:05.700> sintered<00:01:06.030> powder<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.229> has

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a laser sintered powder and so it has

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
a laser sintered powder and so it has
some<00:01:07.710> similar<00:01:08.430> properties<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.939> its<00:01:09.090> design

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
some similar properties in its design

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
some similar properties in its design
rules<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.820> do

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
rules with the way you can do

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
rules with the way you can do
intersecting<00:01:12.390> parts<00:01:12.689> interlocking<00:01:13.140> parts

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
intersecting parts interlocking parts

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
intersecting parts interlocking parts
and<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.820> wall<00:01:15.000> thicknesses

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and the way you can do wall thicknesses

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.770 
and the way you can do wall thicknesses
will<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> more<00:01:16.530> details<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.009> exact

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
will have the more details and exact

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
will have the more details and exact
rules<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> website<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> look

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
rules on the website so you have a look

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
rules on the website so you have a look
at<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> tools<00:01:20.790> page<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> an

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
at that on the tools page but it's an

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.330 
at that on the tools page but it's an
elasto-plastic<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.100> an<00:01:23.189> elastic

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
elasto-plastic so it's an elastic

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.740 
elasto-plastic so it's an elastic
polymer<00:01:23.750> that<00:01:24.750> has<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> ability<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:26.750> squash

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
polymer that has the ability to squash

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
polymer that has the ability to squash
down<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> come<00:01:29.790> back<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> its<00:01:30.180> memory<00:01:31.340> it's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
down and come back to its memory it's

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
down and come back to its memory it's
quite<00:01:32.579> flexible<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.240> rubbery<00:01:33.869> though<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
quite flexible and rubbery though it

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.569 
quite flexible and rubbery though it
doesn't<00:01:34.950> extend<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.729> cooled<00:01:37.189> it<00:01:38.189> depends<00:01:38.520> on

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
doesn't extend when cooled it depends on

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
doesn't extend when cooled it depends on
the<00:01:38.670> geometry<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.079> something

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the geometry so you can make something

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.960 
the geometry so you can make something
that<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.530> stretch<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> say<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.850> this

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that all stretch out like say like this

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
that all stretch out like say like this
piece<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.560> reason<00:01:43.680> why<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:43.950> stretch

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
piece here the reason why this stretch

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
piece here the reason why this stretch
is<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> geometry<00:01:45.270> where

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
is out is because of the geometry where

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
is out is because of the geometry where
their<00:01:46.020> parts<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.320> collapsing<00:01:46.740> basically<00:01:47.189> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
their parts are collapsing basically but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
their parts are collapsing basically but
the<00:01:47.729> parts<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.509> material<00:01:48.899> itself<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.200> not

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the parts the material itself is not

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
the parts the material itself is not
stretching<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> prove<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> I'll<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
stretching so to prove it I'll get a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.760 
stretching so to prove it I'll get a
piece<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.270> I'm<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
piece that I'm going to I'm going to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.889 
piece that I'm going to I'm going to
break<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> piece<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.899> and

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
break off a piece so you can see and

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
break off a piece so you can see and
this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> I'll<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.070> check<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> thickness<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this is I'll just check the thickness of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.820 
this is I'll just check the thickness of
this

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.340 
this
what<00:01:58.250> we're<00:01:58.370> talking<00:01:58.580> about<00:01:58.730> exactly<00:01:59.350> vernier

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
what we're talking about exactly vernier

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.520 
what we're talking about exactly vernier
calipers<00:02:00.740> everyone's<00:02:01.040> best<00:02:01.250> friend<00:02:02.410> now<00:02:03.410> this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
calipers everyone's best friend now this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.660 
calipers everyone's best friend now this
is<00:02:03.680> 1.7<00:02:04.550> millimeter<00:02:05.480> wall<00:02:05.750> thickness<00:02:06.490> at<00:02:07.490> this

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
is 1.7 millimeter wall thickness at this

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.550 
is 1.7 millimeter wall thickness at this
wire<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:09.140> if<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.649> pull<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:11.380> after<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> while

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
wire and if I pull it after a while

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.890 
wire and if I pull it after a while
we'll<00:02:12.710> start<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.070> stretch<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:14.270> it'll

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
we'll start to stretch but it'll

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.110 
we'll start to stretch but it'll
maintain<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.410> stretch<00:02:15.710> if<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.130> back<00:02:16.340> so

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
maintain that stretch if I go back so

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.660 
maintain that stretch if I go back so
it's<00:02:17.240> not<00:02:17.300> really<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> rubber<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:19.550> an

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's not really like a rubber it's an

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.700 
it's not really like a rubber it's an
elastic<00:02:19.910> polymer<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.960> if<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.170> keep<00:02:21.380> on<00:02:21.500> pulling

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
elastic polymer so if I keep on pulling

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.520 
elastic polymer so if I keep on pulling
out<00:02:22.570> eventually<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.020> stretch<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
out eventually it's going to stretch and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.640 
out eventually it's going to stretch and
break<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:26.000> now<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.390> can<00:02:26.480> see<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:26.780> malformed

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
break and now you can see it's malformed

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.860 
break and now you can see it's malformed
and<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:28.430> maintained<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> memory<00:02:29.210> of<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and it's maintained the memory of the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.030 
and it's maintained the memory of the
brake<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.530> back<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.830> its<00:02:30.950> original

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
brake not going back to its original

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.390 
brake not going back to its original
form<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.660> something<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.990> be<00:02:33.050> aware<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.040> it's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
form so something to be aware of so it's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.490 
form so something to be aware of so it's
not<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.640> rubber<00:02:34.850> but<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:36.170> does<00:02:36.320> have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
not a rubber but it is it does have

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.220 
not a rubber but it is it does have
flexibility<00:02:37.510> now<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.900> other<00:02:38.990> thing<00:02:39.140> to

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
flexibility now the other thing to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.060 
flexibility now the other thing to
notice<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:40.610> will<00:02:41.920> doesn't<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.040> a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
notice is that it will doesn't have a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.490 
notice is that it will doesn't have a
perfect<00:02:43.310> memory<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.170> depending<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> on

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
perfect memory so depending on the on

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.070 
perfect memory so depending on the on
the<00:02:45.590> geometry<00:02:45.740> if<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.340> crunch<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.880> down<00:02:47.120> like

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
the geometry if I crunch this down like

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.330 
the geometry if I crunch this down like
so<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:51.200> will<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:51.470> being<00:02:51.680> slightly<00:02:52.010> warped

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
so it will then being slightly warped

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.990 
so it will then being slightly warped
and<00:02:52.630> slowly<00:02:53.630> come<00:02:54.080> back<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.760> need<00:02:58.910> to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
and slowly come back so you just need to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.610 
and slowly come back so you just need to
be<00:02:59.150> aware<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.750> that<00:02:59.870> field<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.350> for<00:03:00.530> your

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
be aware of that field is up for your

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.740 
be aware of that field is up for your
designs<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.940> perfect<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.390> something<00:03:02.660> like

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
designs it's perfect for something like

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.990 
designs it's perfect for something like
an<00:03:02.870> iPhone<00:03:03.019> case<00:03:03.230> because<00:03:04.070> it's<00:03:04.220> really<00:03:04.670> quite

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
an iPhone case because it's really quite

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.620 
an iPhone case because it's really quite
strong

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
strong

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.390 
strong
it'll<00:03:06.019> bounce<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.380> bit<00:03:06.500> more<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.010> won't

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it'll bounce a bit more and a won't

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.729 
it'll bounce a bit more and a won't
crack<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.239> nylon<00:03:08.570> would<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.530> some

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
crack like the nylon would in some

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.610 
crack like the nylon would in some
instances<00:03:10.190> with<00:03:10.310> impact<00:03:11.110> now<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> sort<00:03:12.560> of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
instances with impact now to sort of

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
instances with impact now to sort of
show<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:12.860> how<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.160> works<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.670> also<00:03:13.850> show<00:03:14.060> you

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
show you how this works I also show you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.250 
show you how this works I also show you
how<00:03:14.150> much<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.510> compresses<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.320> now<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.190> is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
how much it compresses like now this is

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.250 
how much it compresses like now this is
this<00:03:18.260> wall<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.800> unit<00:03:19.070> here<00:03:19.989> we'll<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.170> a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
this wall of this unit here we'll just a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.380 
this wall of this unit here we'll just a
solid<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:22.630> say<00:03:23.630> 2.7<00:03:24.590> millimeters<00:03:25.120> high<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> will

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
solid is say 2.7 millimeters high I will

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.300 
solid is say 2.7 millimeters high I will
do<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.750> second<00:03:27.019> beeps<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.980> now<00:03:28.100> going<00:03:28.220> to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
do like the second beeps so now going to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.090 
do like the second beeps so now going to
show<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.610> wall<00:03:28.820> how<00:03:29.269> much<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.540> compresses

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
show you the wall how much of compresses

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.430 
show you the wall how much of compresses
now<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.250> part<00:03:31.459> here<00:03:31.610> is<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:32.120> 2.8<00:03:32.870> millimeters

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
now this part here is is 2.8 millimeters

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.180 
now this part here is is 2.8 millimeters
if<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.340> push<00:03:34.550> really<00:03:35.000> really<00:03:35.209> hard<00:03:36.010> again<00:03:37.010> into

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
if I push really really hard again into

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.060 
if I push really really hard again into
2.5<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.630> doesn't<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:38.989> much<00:03:39.230> squishiness

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
2.5 so it doesn't have much squishiness

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.670 
2.5 so it doesn't have much squishiness
in<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.700> material<00:03:41.000> itself<00:03:41.269> but<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.110> can<00:03:42.350> in<00:03:42.620> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
in the material itself but it can in the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.290 
in the material itself but it can in the
geometry<00:03:42.890> as<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.459> can<00:03:43.580> see<00:03:43.760> if<00:03:44.030> something's

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
geometry as you can see if something's

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.729 
geometry as you can see if something's
wiry<00:03:44.540> like<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:46.300> with<00:03:47.300> that<00:03:47.450> if<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.140> if<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.500> do<00:03:48.560> it

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
wiry like this with that if I if I do it

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.410 
wiry like this with that if I if I do it
with<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.010> sort<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.580> John<00:03:49.820> this<00:03:50.239> little

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
with the sort of John this little

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.690 
with the sort of John this little
geometry<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.680> can<00:03:51.830> see<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.220> what

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
geometry here you can see that what

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.300 
geometry here you can see that what
would<00:03:52.880> have<00:03:52.970> started<00:03:53.180> out<00:03:53.300> at<00:03:53.680> let's<00:03:54.680> say<00:03:54.830> 24

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
would have started out at let's say 24

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
would have started out at let's say 24
millimeters<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.840> push<00:03:56.989> down<00:03:57.019> with

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
millimeters I can push down with

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.009 
millimeters I can push down with
considerable<00:03:58.250> effort<00:03:58.870> down<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.080> like<00:04:00.230> 14<00:04:00.739> 15

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
considerable effort down to like 14 15

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.120 
considerable effort down to like 14 15
now<00:04:03.019> if<00:04:03.110> I<00:04:03.170> try<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.410> same<00:04:03.620> thing<00:04:03.680> with<00:04:04.040> the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
now if I try the same thing with the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.399 
now if I try the same thing with the
nylon

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
nylon

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.809 
nylon
which<00:04:06.409> is<00:04:06.560> these<00:04:06.739> other<00:04:07.129> similar<00:04:07.459> material

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
which is these other similar material

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.300 
which is these other similar material
you<00:04:08.450> can<00:04:08.569> see<00:04:08.599> there's<00:04:09.040> there's<00:04:10.040> no

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
you can see there's there's no

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.289 
you can see there's there's no
compression<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.030> this<00:04:12.019> way<00:04:12.409> it's<00:04:13.220> very<00:04:13.940> stiff

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
compression and this way it's very stiff

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.890 
compression and this way it's very stiff
I<00:04:14.390> can<00:04:14.510> get<00:04:14.599> it<00:04:14.690> down<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:15.880> maybe<00:04:16.880> half<00:04:17.780> a

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
I can get it down to maybe half a

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.159 
I can get it down to maybe half a
millimeter<00:04:18.260> of<00:04:18.350> compression<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.180> what<00:04:21.049> this

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
millimeter of compression so what this

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.780 
millimeter of compression so what this
allows<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:22.190> take<00:04:22.400> more<00:04:22.669> stress<00:04:22.970> and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
allows is it to take more stress and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.070 
allows is it to take more stress and
impact<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.150> let's<00:04:26.300> take<00:04:26.449> a<00:04:26.479> look<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.720> impact

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
impact so let's take a look at impact

00:04:27.080 --> 00:05:44.800 
impact so let's take a look at impact
now

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.940 

it<00:05:45.810> will<00:05:45.960> hold<00:05:46.200> it<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:48.470> I've<00:05:49.470> tested<00:05:49.830> this

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
it will hold it and I've tested this

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.770 
it will hold it and I've tested this
over<00:05:50.220> several<00:05:50.430> hours<00:05:50.700> and<00:05:51.060> there<00:05:51.480> was<00:05:51.600> never

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
over several hours and there was never

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.530 
over several hours and there was never
any<00:05:52.020> that<00:05:52.260> leaked<00:05:52.560> out<00:05:52.830> of<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:53.070> but<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.060> pores

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
any that leaked out of it but the pores

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.710 
any that leaked out of it but the pores
of<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.050> material<00:05:55.740> did<00:05:56.520> seem<00:05:56.880> to<00:05:56.910> absorb<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.570> so

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
of the material did seem to absorb it so

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.050 
of the material did seem to absorb it so
it<00:05:57.840> seems<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.260> absorb<00:05:58.620> moisture<00:05:58.860> so<00:05:59.820> if<00:05:59.940> you're

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
it seems to absorb moisture so if you're

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.690 
it seems to absorb moisture so if you're
making<00:06:00.180> something<00:06:00.450> like<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.580> planter<00:06:02.580> or

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
making something like a a planter or

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.750 
making something like a a planter or
something<00:06:02.910> it's<00:06:03.030> perfect<00:06:04.130> but<00:06:05.130> it's<00:06:05.490> not

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
something it's perfect but it's not

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.080 
something it's perfect but it's not
exactly<00:06:06.350> completely<00:06:07.350> watertight

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
exactly completely watertight

exactly completely watertight
you'll<00:06:09.390> also<00:06:09.540> notice<00:06:09.810> we've<00:06:09.960> got<00:06:10.080> some<00:06:10.200> excess

powder on this with where at the moment
we're<00:06:12.650> releasing<00:06:13.650> this<00:06:13.800> it's<00:06:14.550> still<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> little

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
we're releasing this it's still a little

initial launch and the water is retained
in<00:06:29.870> so<00:06:30.870> you<00:06:30.930> can<00:06:31.500> actually<00:06:32.250> do<00:06:33.110> like<00:06:34.110> suction

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
in so you can actually do like suction

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.290 
in so you can actually do like suction
cups<00:06:34.700> I'm<00:06:35.700> not<00:06:35.820> sure<00:06:35.910> I<00:06:35.940> was<00:06:36.030> going<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.210> hold

we've<00:06:46.440> tested<00:06:46.650> stretch<00:06:47.180> we've<00:06:48.180> tested<00:06:48.420> how

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
we've tested stretch we've tested how

handles flame now don't try this at home
kids<00:06:56.970> but<00:06:58.880> let's<00:06:59.880> see<00:06:59.970> what<00:07:00.060> happens

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.760 

above<00:07:03.310> the<00:07:03.430> flame<00:07:03.669> is<00:07:04.270> melting<00:07:04.780> like<00:07:04.990> so<00:07:07.770> with

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
above the flame is melting like so with

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.240 
above the flame is melting like so with
flame<00:07:09.100> contact<00:07:10.410> it's<00:07:11.410> a<00:07:11.470> light<00:07:11.650> and<00:07:11.979> roofing

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
flame contact it's a light and roofing

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.780 
flame contact it's a light and roofing
well<00:07:12.630> so<00:07:13.630> not<00:07:14.050> the<00:07:14.199> best<00:07:14.350> idea

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
well so not the best idea

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.420 
well so not the best idea
so<00:07:15.790> no<00:07:15.940> candle<00:07:16.300> holders<00:07:16.540> please<00:07:16.750> people<00:07:16.990> and

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 
so no candle holders please people and

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:25.860 
so no candle holders please people and
the<00:07:18.430> smell<00:07:20.970> plasticky<00:07:24.600> now<00:07:25.600> something<00:07:25.840> that's

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
the smell plasticky now something that's

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.760 
the smell plasticky now something that's
hard<00:07:26.110> to<00:07:26.199> communicate<00:07:26.380> but<00:07:26.949> is<00:07:27.220> um<00:07:28.530> is<00:07:29.530> worth

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
hard to communicate but is um is worth

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:36.060 
hard to communicate but is um is worth
noting<00:07:30.190> is<00:07:30.370> a<00:07:31.120> surface<00:07:31.630> finish<00:07:33.300> is<00:07:34.300> a<00:07:35.070> little

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
noting is a surface finish is a little

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.879 
noting is a surface finish is a little
rough<00:07:36.280> like<00:07:36.820> it's

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:37.889 
rough like it's

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.080 
rough like it's
and<00:07:38.889> we<00:07:39.010> can't<00:07:39.190> smooth<00:07:39.520> it<00:07:39.639> in<00:07:39.699> the<00:07:39.760> same<00:07:39.940> way

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:40.090 
and we can't smooth it in the same way

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.820 
and we can't smooth it in the same way
we<00:07:40.210> can<00:07:40.360> the<00:07:40.539> nylon<00:07:40.900> to<00:07:41.500> something<00:07:41.740> to<00:07:41.800> be

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830 
we can the nylon to something to be
