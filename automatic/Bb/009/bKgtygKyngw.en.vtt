what's in the new game apparently strike

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
what's in the new game apparently strike
animations<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.619> faster<00:00:20.520> more

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
animations are a lot faster more

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.390 
animations are a lot faster more
difficult<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> counter<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.380> reverse<00:00:23.070> will<00:00:23.279> go

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
difficult to counter a reverse will go

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.370 
difficult to counter a reverse will go
straight<00:00:23.760> into<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.210> move<00:00:24.570> now<00:00:24.810> apparently

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
straight into a move now apparently

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.109 
straight into a move now apparently
rather<00:00:25.710> than<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.189> kind<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> getting<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.970> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
rather than just kind of getting out of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
rather than just kind of getting out of
that<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.539> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> move<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.529> person

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that that kind of move that the person

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
that that kind of move that the person
was<00:00:28.980> attempting<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.929> finishes<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
was attempting and finishes and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.470 
was attempting and finishes and
signature<00:00:31.710> moves<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.270> incorporated<00:00:33.270> into

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
signature moves are incorporated into

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.010 
signature moves are incorporated into
comebacks<00:00:34.309> apparently<00:00:35.309> there's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.489> new

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
comebacks apparently there's a new

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.690 
comebacks apparently there's a new
catapult<00:00:37.020> finishes<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:37.710> well<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.489> they're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
catapult finishes as well so they're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.340 
catapult finishes as well so they're
similar<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> catch<00:00:39.540> finishes<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.200> we

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
similar to the catch finishes that we

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.369 
similar to the catch finishes that we
had<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.010> w/e<00:00:41.579> 13<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.300> basically<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.989> with

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
had in the w/e 13 but basically we with

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.869 
had in the w/e 13 but basically we with
these<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.280> whilst<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
these you can use them whilst on the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
these you can use them whilst on the
offensive<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> defensive

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
offensive so it's not just a defensive

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.090 
offensive so it's not just a defensive
mood<00:00:47.280> move<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.410> everyone

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
mood move you can do so everyone

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
mood move you can do so everyone
apparently<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> catch<00:00:51.059> finisher<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
apparently you had a catch finisher in

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.760 
apparently you had a catch finisher in
w/e<00:00:52.050> 13<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.090> game<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
w/e 13 will have one in this game as and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.110 
w/e 13 will have one in this game as and
there'll<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> whole<00:00:56.550> bunch<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> new<00:00:57.090> people

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
there'll be a whole bunch of new people

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.599 
there'll be a whole bunch of new people
who<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.430> rock

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
who got that as well so the rock

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.310 
who got that as well so the rock
apparently<00:01:00.120> has<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> these<00:01:00.539> catapult<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
apparently has one of these catapult and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
apparently has one of these catapult and
catch<00:01:01.530> finishes<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.640> guessing<00:01:03.030> he

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
catch finishes now so I'm guessing he

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
catch finishes now so I'm guessing he
can<00:01:03.480> catch<00:01:03.690> someone<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.589> rock<00:01:04.890> bottom

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
can catch someone into it a rock bottom

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
can catch someone into it a rock bottom
that<00:01:05.640> sounds<00:01:06.000> pretty<00:01:06.299> damn<00:01:06.600> sweet<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.799> are

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that sounds pretty damn sweet there are

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
that sounds pretty damn sweet there are
also<00:01:08.010> apparently<00:01:08.490> 10<00:01:08.850> new<00:01:09.270> catch<00:01:09.659> finishes

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
also apparently 10 new catch finishes

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
also apparently 10 new catch finishes
and<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.100> guessing<00:01:11.400> everyone<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> cache

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and I'm guessing everyone as a cache

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
and I'm guessing everyone as a cache
catch<00:01:12.479> finisher<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> catapult<00:01:13.500> finisher

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
catch finisher has a catapult finisher

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
catch finisher has a catapult finisher
as<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.939> me<00:01:15.030> interesting<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> see

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689

who's<00:01:15.990> who's<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> lineup<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
who's who's in the lineup for that

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.109

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
apparently a ring post boot from the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
apparently a ring post boot from the
outside<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.060> screenshot<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.720> that
