00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
one vision call at each end in the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.600 
one vision call at each end in the
center<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:48.800> put<00:01:49.010> more<00:01:49.130> fusion<00:01:49.370> clothes

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
eight because you don't have that many

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.080 
eight because you don't have that many
weapon<00:01:53.090> holders<00:01:54.010> just<00:01:55.010> make<00:01:55.190> sure<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.700> blows

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
weapon holders just make sure it blows

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.370 
weapon holders just make sure it blows
up<00:01:56.120> the<00:01:56.390> gravel<00:01:56.780> sufficient<00:01:57.200> clothes

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
up the gravel sufficient clothes

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.200

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
probably will revoke the ground was no

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.840 
probably will revoke the ground was no
matter<00:01:59.390> where<00:01:59.600> they<00:01:59.630> are<00:02:00.430> then<00:02:01.430> just<00:02:01.610> put<00:02:01.820> a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
matter where they are then just put a

weapon all day overall though scrap
fusion<00:02:03.980> color<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:04.550> gravels<00:02:04.880> don't<00:02:05.090> send

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
fusion color so the gravels don't send

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.620 
fusion color so the gravels don't send
up<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.440> sky<00:02:07.090> because<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.330> won't<00:02:08.480> work

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
up in the sky because then it won't work

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.530 
up in the sky because then it won't work
at<00:02:08.780> all<00:02:09.340> there<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.460> go<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.090> now

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
at all there you go just like that now

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.870 
at all there you go just like that now
this<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.560> easiest<00:02:12.890> part<00:02:13.540> 2<00:02:14.540> gravis<00:02:15.880> one

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this is the easiest part 2 gravis one

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.190 
this is the easiest part 2 gravis one
there<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.270> don't<00:02:17.420> even<00:02:17.510> need<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.960> you<00:02:18.080> could

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
there you don't even need to you could

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.010 
there you don't even need to you could
use<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:21.500> two<00:02:21.650> works<00:02:21.860> better<00:02:22.100> obviously

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
use one but two works better obviously

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.860 
use one but two works better obviously
and<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:25.520> over<00:02:25.640> top<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.360> food<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
and you put over top see the food and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.970 
and you put over top see the food and
clothes<00:02:26.990> moved<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.350> little<00:02:27.470> bit<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:27.830> they're

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
clothes moved a little bit but they're

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.040 
clothes moved a little bit but they're
staying<00:02:28.250> there<00:02:28.600> next<00:02:29.600> thing<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.780> want<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.960> do

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
staying there next thing you want to do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.280 
staying there next thing you want to do
is<00:02:30.170> get<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.860> dumpster<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.910> you're<00:02:32.900> basically

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
is get a dumpster and you're basically

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.690 
is get a dumpster and you're basically
done<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.620> can<00:02:33.740> put<00:02:33.890> walls<00:02:34.100> around<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.550> edges

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
done you can put walls around the edges

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.300 
done you can put walls around the edges
so<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.420> pee<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.320> can<00:02:36.650> Archie's<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.190> as<00:02:37.280> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
so like pee so you can Archie's it as a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.650 
so like pee so you can Archie's it as a
gate<00:02:37.580> i<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.970> did<00:02:38.120> i'm<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.570> show

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
gate i just did i'm not going to show

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.490 
gate i just did i'm not going to show
you<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.810> because<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.230> pretty

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
you that because it's pretty

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.010 
you that because it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.280> easy<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.480> and<00:02:41.810> how

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
self-explanatory and easy so and how

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.449 
self-explanatory and easy so and how
this<00:02:42.140> works<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.709> gravel<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.130> actually

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
this works the gravel is actually

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.540 
this works the gravel is actually
pulling<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.630> cart<00:02:45.290> up<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.500> don't<00:02:46.280> surf

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
pulling the cart up the don't surf

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.770 
pulling the cart up the don't surf

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
through the on offense wall even put it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.860 
through the on offense wall even put it
up<00:02:50.840> right<00:02:51.080> but<00:02:51.590> since<00:02:52.070> um<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.820> only<00:02:53.090> did<00:02:53.450> one<00:02:53.660> box
