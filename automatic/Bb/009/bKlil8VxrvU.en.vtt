00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.340
 with a silver 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.040
 there will be more 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.970
 in the culture 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 making sense always 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.560
 ahead 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.350
 and about that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.369
 I believe that I believe that in essence the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 difference is the world 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.300
 because as a baby he will bring him a tail 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 besides that it is comfortable 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 they transform anything is a lot 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.320
 more romantic this 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.070
 all that searches 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.070
 the different or frankenstein 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 Y 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.909
 m 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:32.230
 viering loves disappears them too 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.810
 while they remain the comments 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.020
 it's better than a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 Y 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.829
 but no more 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.420
 hard 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.420
 and walking write 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.320
 we listen to pop rock blues if those other 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360
 the things in this comparison different 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.910
 you have a lot more blues then it's a 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650
 very personal thing that I am for more 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.460
 I say new music every time the blues 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.040
 pulls me more and more 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.860
 center of the universe not only of forceps 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 it also has a little on the market I think 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.420
 that there are many but they are in Brussels 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.380
 but a lot of music always goes if there is not 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 so keep experimenting and getting 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.920
 in other places 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.920
 I love rock is those thousand 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.530
 my spearhead but this one I just 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.370
 to also make a record of sones and if 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.370
 I can do something 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.430
 today we will be 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.209
 we are not going to sell ourselves to look 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.600
 music enslaved to nobody every time 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.740
 he tried to open more by 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.740
 you do not take long in my life
