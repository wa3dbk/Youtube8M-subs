hi welcome to simply Scooba the apex rk3

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.820 
hi welcome to simply Scooba the apex rk3
finn<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.970> derived<00:00:09.900> from<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.260> military

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
finn is derived from the military

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
finn is derived from the military
designed<00:00:11.219> Finn<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.000> nice<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.540> strong

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
designed Finn so it's nice and strong

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.829 
designed Finn so it's nice and strong
nice<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.380> short<00:00:13.710> but<00:00:13.860> nice<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.580> wide<00:00:14.849> so

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
nice and short but nice and wide so

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.450 
nice and short but nice and wide so
we'll<00:00:15.990> keep<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.590> any<00:00:16.859> kind<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.279> diving

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
we'll keep up with any kind of diving

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.950 
we'll keep up with any kind of diving
that<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> need<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.210> it'll<00:00:18.690> give<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that you need to do it'll give you a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380 
that you need to do it'll give you a
nice<00:00:19.230> amount<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.830> propulsion<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.029> it'll<00:00:21.240> also

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
nice amount of propulsion but it'll also

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.620 
nice amount of propulsion but it'll also
put<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> whole<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.949> abuse<00:00:23.630> it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
put up with a whole lot of abuse it's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.109 
put up with a whole lot of abuse it's
one<00:00:24.930> single<00:00:25.439> piece<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.890> thermo<00:00:26.460> molded<00:00:26.910> rubber

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
one single piece of thermo molded rubber

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.710 
one single piece of thermo molded rubber
so<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:27.960> nice<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.199> secure<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so it's nice and secure but it's got a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.810 
so it's nice and secure but it's got a
nice<00:00:30.929> amount<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.380> flexibility<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.610> well

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
nice amount of flexibility in it as well

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170 
nice amount of flexibility in it as well
it's<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> channeled<00:00:34.440> blade<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it's got a channeled blade here which is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's got a channeled blade here which is
also<00:00:36.390> vented<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.250> will<00:00:38.309> do

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
also vented as well so what it will do

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
also vented as well so what it will do
is<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.030> has<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.930> forward<00:00:40.230> thrust<00:00:40.559> with

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
is it has all the forward thrust with

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
is it has all the forward thrust with
none<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> pooling<00:00:43.020> drag

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
none of the with the pooling drag

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.819 
none of the with the pooling drag
effects<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.420> during<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:46.079> kick<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
effects so during the down kick or the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
effects so during the down kick or the
water<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> hit<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> blades<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
water is going to hit the blades and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
water is going to hit the blades and
then<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.980> dead<00:00:50.309> space<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
then in this dead space here is going to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.330 
then in this dead space here is going to
be<00:00:51.600> vented<00:00:52.140> through<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> way<00:00:53.129> you've<00:00:53.309> got

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
be vented through so that way you've got

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
be vented through so that way you've got
all<00:00:53.699> forward<00:00:54.690> motion<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.100> down<00:00:56.370> kick<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all forward motion on the down kick the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.720 
all forward motion on the down kick the
opposite<00:00:57.780> happens<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.859> water<00:00:59.039> hits<00:00:59.399> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
opposite happens as the water hits it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
opposite happens as the water hits it's
all<00:00:59.969> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> trapped<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> channeled

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
all going to get trapped and channeled

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
all going to get trapped and channeled
there<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.370> pushed

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there and it's all going to get pushed

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
there and it's all going to get pushed
away<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.080> you've<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> nice<00:01:04.559> full

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
away from you so you've got a nice full

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
away from you so you've got a nice full
amount<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.970> propulsion<00:01:06.360> without<00:01:07.260> needing<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
amount of propulsion without needing a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.149 
amount of propulsion without needing a
lot<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> effort<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> blade<00:01:10.200> itself<00:01:10.590> what

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
lot of effort the blade itself what

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.560 
lot of effort the blade itself what
they've<00:01:11.280> done<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.640> they've<00:01:11.850> added<00:01:12.060> these

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
they've done is they've added these

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
they've done is they've added these
little<00:01:12.630> pockets<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.479> hook

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
