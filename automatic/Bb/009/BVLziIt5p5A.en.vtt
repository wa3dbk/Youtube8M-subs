00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
me too but then on my last playthrough I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.889 
me too but then on my last playthrough I
remembered<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.240> screen<00:01:48.540> capture

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
remembered I have screen capture

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.190 
remembered I have screen capture
software<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.710> yay<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
software now so yay so here are the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.230 
software now so yay so here are the
contents<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.829> present<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> revolver<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
hijack the plane with and the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.910 
hijack the plane with and the
coordinates<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> rapture<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.500> decided<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> find

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
coordinates of rapture I decided to find

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
coordinates of rapture I decided to find
out<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.399> rapture<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> real-world

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
out where rapture is on the real-world

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.590 
out where rapture is on the real-world
map<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> tried<00:02:01.890> plugging<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.340> 63<00:02:03.030> point<00:02:03.420> two

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
map so I tried plugging in 63 point two

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
map so I tried plugging in 63 point two
degrees<00:02:03.899> north<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.560> however<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> say<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
degrees north there however you say that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.839 
degrees north there however you say that

Earth<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.869> gave<00:02:10.140> me<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.430> Atlantic

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849

now<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> realistic<00:02:15.060> location<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
now this is a realistic location for the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.420 
now this is a realistic location for the
city<00:02:16.170> because<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> Atlantic<00:02:17.310> Ocean

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
city because it's in the Atlantic Ocean
which<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.880> already<00:02:18.000> knew<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:19.020> close<00:02:19.319> enough

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
which we already knew it is close enough

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
which we already knew it is close enough
to<00:02:19.770> neighboring<00:02:20.160> countries<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.610> resupply

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
to neighboring countries to resupply

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.090 
to neighboring countries to resupply
there<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.630> needs<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.590> separated

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
there if it needs to but separated

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
there if it needs to but separated
enough<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> remain<00:02:23.850> isolated<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.900> was

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
enough to remain isolated which that was

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.570 
enough to remain isolated which that was
the<00:02:25.110> entire<00:02:25.350> purpose<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> city<00:02:26.190> at<00:02:26.340> first

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the entire purpose of the city at first

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.840 
the entire purpose of the city at first
at<00:02:27.080> first<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.410> was<00:02:28.890> quite<00:02:29.220> happy<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
at first I was quite happy with this

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.460 
at first I was quite happy with this
discovery<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.020> remembered

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
discovery but then I remembered

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
discovery but then I remembered
something<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.640> teaser<00:02:32.970> website<00:02:33.150> for

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
location of rapture is shown as much

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.309 
location of rapture is shown as much

I<00:02:44.310> then<00:02:44.459> plotted<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.120> Google<00:02:45.510> Earth<00:02:45.600> as

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
I then plotted it on Google Earth as

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.560 
I then plotted it on Google Earth as
well<00:02:46.050> now<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.310> about<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.730> thousand<00:02:48.390> miles

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
well now this is about a thousand miles

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.750 
well now this is about a thousand miles
more<00:02:48.959> South<00:02:49.350> than<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.980> coordinates<00:02:50.400> given<00:02:50.489> by

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
the first game Bioshock 2 takes place

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.940 
the first game Bioshock 2 takes place
about<00:02:54.630> 10<00:02:54.959> years<00:02:55.140> after<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> first<00:02:55.800> game

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
about 10 years after the first game

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.340 
about 10 years after the first game
after<00:02:56.489> taking<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.540> into<00:02:57.780> account<00:02:57.840> and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
after taking this into account and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.290 
after taking this into account and
thinking<00:02:58.769> about<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.280> while<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.670> came<00:03:00.000> up

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
thinking about it for a while I came up

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.780 
thinking about it for a while I came up
with<00:03:00.330> three<00:03:00.720> scenarios<00:03:01.019> why<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.470> might<00:03:01.739> be

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
with three scenarios why this might be

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.550 
with three scenarios why this might be
the<00:03:02.790> first<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.360> least<00:03:03.690> likely<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the first and least likely is that the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
the first and least likely is that the
