you twist in like that and it kind of
locks<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:43.800> place<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> something<00:00:45.239> I

of<00:01:13.439> huge<00:01:13.740> why<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.520> they're<00:01:14.820> designed<00:01:15.090> by

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

of huge why if they're designed by
fitness<00:01:15.630> enthusiasts<00:01:16.409> why<00:01:16.590> are<00:01:16.650> they<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.040> damn

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

huge<00:01:17.820> um<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.080> guess<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
huge um but I guess that's just the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
huge um but I guess that's just the
design<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.759> chose<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.360> we'll<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
design they chose and so we'll have to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.330 
design they chose and so we'll have to
work<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.229> that'd<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.100> nice

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
work with that but that'd be really nice

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
work with that but that'd be really nice

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I thought it was going to be spot-on but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
I thought it was going to be spot-on but

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
always work and sometimes you can't even

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
always work and sometimes you can't even
turn<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> huge<00:01:37.170> hassle<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
turn the thing on it's a huge hassle and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
turn the thing on it's a huge hassle and
I've<00:01:38.430> had<00:01:38.579> some<00:01:38.759> pairing<00:01:39.150> issues<00:01:39.479> which

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I've had some pairing issues which

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
I've had some pairing issues which
really<00:01:39.990> pissed<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.439> off<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:41.250> when<00:01:41.430> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
really pissed me off but when it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
really pissed me off but when it's
working<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:42.810> nice

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
working it's actually a pretty nice

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.679 
working it's actually a pretty nice
little<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.909> ear<00:01:45.180> buds<00:01:45.420> here

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
little little little ear buds here

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
little little little ear buds here
they're<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.170> portable<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
they're really portable and you can just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
they're really portable and you can just
go<00:01:48.420> ahead<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.869> store<00:01:49.500> them<00:01:49.649> away<00:01:49.710> anytime<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
go ahead and store them away anytime you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.889 
go ahead and store them away anytime you
need<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:51.149> him<00:01:51.299> anywhere<00:01:51.600> or<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.869> anything

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
need to take him anywhere or do anything

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.679 
need to take him anywhere or do anything
with<00:01:52.229> him<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.640> um<00:01:54.659> I

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
with him so I really like that um I

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
with him so I really like that um I
guess<00:01:55.409> they're<00:01:55.590> not<00:01:55.619> completely<00:01:56.310> wireless

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
guess they're not completely wireless

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
guess they're not completely wireless
because<00:01:57.149> they<00:01:57.240> still<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.600> wires<00:01:57.840> they<00:01:58.140> can

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
because they still have wires they can

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
because they still have wires they can
still<00:01:58.500> get<00:01:58.590> tangled<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.579> they<00:01:59.700> did

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
still get tangled but I think they did

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.700 
still get tangled but I think they did
this<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> don't<00:02:00.479> end<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.689> losing<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.409> own

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
this so you don't end up losing your own

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.780 
this so you don't end up losing your own
device<00:02:02.040> which<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> probably<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> good<00:02:03.810> thing<00:02:04.790> so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
device which is probably a good thing so

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
device which is probably a good thing so

was wondering why is this here like this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.140 
was wondering why is this here like this
needs<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.919> be<00:03:23.010> shorter<00:03:23.459> or<00:03:23.489> there<00:03:23.879> needs<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.090> be

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
needs to be shorter or there needs to be

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.539 
needs to be shorter or there needs to be
a<00:03:24.209> way<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:24.419> like<00:03:24.690> tuck<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:25.859> somehow<00:03:26.129> or<00:03:26.280> do

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
a way to like tuck this in somehow or do

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.979 
a way to like tuck this in somehow or do
something<00:03:26.910> with<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.660> was<00:03:27.750> really

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
something with it and it was really

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.839 
something with it and it was really
rigid<00:03:28.379> it<00:03:28.500> was<00:03:28.590> pointing<00:03:28.980> one<00:03:29.160> direction<00:03:29.669> for

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
rigid it was pointing one direction for

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.909 
rigid it was pointing one direction for
a<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.329> long<00:03:30.480> time<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:31.410> has<00:03:31.470> something<00:03:31.769> to

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
a really long time it has something to

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.680 
a really long time it has something to
do<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.250> material<00:03:32.879> it<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.090> made<00:03:33.449> out<00:03:33.480> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
do with this material it was made out of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.819 
do with this material it was made out of
a<00:03:33.870> very<00:03:34.290> um<00:03:35.419> rough<00:03:36.419> I<00:03:36.780> don't<00:03:37.319> know<00:03:37.410> kind<00:03:37.739> of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
a very um rough I don't know kind of

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.710 
a very um rough I don't know kind of
like<00:03:38.099> cloth<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.730> material<00:03:39.239> I'm<00:03:39.299> not<00:03:39.480> quite

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
like cloth like material I'm not quite

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.170 
like cloth like material I'm not quite
sure<00:03:39.750> what<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> call<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.680> but<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.760> was<00:03:42.030> just

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
sure what to call it but it was just

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.599 
sure what to call it but it was just
really<00:03:42.419> tough<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.799> over<00:03:43.980> time<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.430> got<00:03:44.579> a

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
really tough but over time it got a

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.189 
really tough but over time it got a
little<00:03:44.790> bit<00:03:44.970> softer<00:03:45.419> and<00:03:45.599> now<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:45.900> actually

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
little bit softer and now it's actually

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.259 
little bit softer and now it's actually
pretty<00:03:46.410> nice<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.949> so<00:03:47.129> it's<00:03:47.730> great<00:03:48.239> for

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
pretty nice and so it's great for

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.699 
pretty nice and so it's great for
running<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.930> guys<00:03:49.079> are<00:03:49.199> going<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.410> love<00:03:49.560> this

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
running you guys are going to love this

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.619 
running you guys are going to love this
thing<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.239> -<00:03:51.299> they're<00:03:51.510> definitely

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
thing it is I - they're definitely

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.900 
thing it is I - they're definitely
better<00:03:52.019> than<00:03:52.139> having<00:03:52.530> wires<00:03:52.769> um<00:03:53.519> but<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.790> do

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
better than having wires um but they do

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.080 
better than having wires um but they do
make<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> lot<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:54.660> bold<00:03:54.989> claims<00:03:55.440> which

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
make a lot of really bold claims which

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.300 
make a lot of really bold claims which
surprised<00:03:57.090> me<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.299> little<00:03:57.449> bit<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:58.799> make

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
surprised me a little bit so they make

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860 
surprised me a little bit so they make
the<00:03:59.459> claim<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.760> it's<00:04:00.030> never<00:04:00.269> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.569> fall

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
the claim that it's never going to fall

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.770 
the claim that it's never going to fall
out<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.639> your<00:04:02.639> ear<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> funny<00:04:03.540> thing<00:04:03.629> is

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
out of your ear and the funny thing is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.140 
out of your ear and the funny thing is
the<00:04:04.049> first<00:04:04.290> few<00:04:04.919> times<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.430> use<00:04:05.699> them<00:04:05.970> that's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the first few times I use them that's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.000 
the first few times I use them that's
the<00:04:06.299> first<00:04:06.569> thing<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:07.019> did<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.379> fall<00:04:07.650> out<00:04:07.859> of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the first thing they did is fall out of

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.559 
the first thing they did is fall out of
my<00:04:08.099> ear<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.489> really<00:04:08.940> pissed<00:04:09.359> me<00:04:09.480> off

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
my ear and it really pissed me off

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.210 
my ear and it really pissed me off
because<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.930> was<00:04:10.079> running<00:04:10.260> there<00:04:10.859> was<00:04:10.979> a<00:04:11.010> really

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
because I was running there was a really

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.770 
because I was running there was a really
good<00:04:11.340> song<00:04:11.609> playing<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.209> then<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:12.329> fell<00:04:12.659> out

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
good song playing and then it fell out

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.059 
good song playing and then it fell out
of<00:04:12.810> my<00:04:12.959> ear

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
of my ear

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.339 
of my ear
I<00:04:14.129> had<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.639> more<00:04:15.419> than<00:04:15.599> once<00:04:15.870> when<00:04:16.199> you're

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
I had it more than once when you're

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.680 
I had it more than once when you're
running<00:04:16.709> there's<00:04:17.579> connectivity<00:04:18.299> issues

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
running there's connectivity issues

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.360 
running there's connectivity issues
where<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.139> start<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.650> lose<00:04:19.829> connection<00:04:20.310> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
where you start to lose connection a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.279 
where you start to lose connection a
little<00:04:20.400> bit<00:04:20.669> every<00:04:20.849> now<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.150> then<00:04:21.239> I'd<00:04:22.079> say

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
little bit every now and then I'd say

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.750 
little bit every now and then I'd say
it's<00:04:22.440> not<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.770> big<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.070> problem<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.639> it

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
it's not that big of a problem but it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.840 
it's not that big of a problem but it
does<00:04:23.940> happen<00:04:24.330> from<00:04:24.389> time

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
does happen from time

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.120 
does happen from time
is<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.270> little<00:04:25.450> bit<00:04:25.540> annoying<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:26.110> hope<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.890> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
is a little bit annoying I hope in the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.490 
is a little bit annoying I hope in the
next<00:04:27.490> iteration<00:04:27.850> or<00:04:28.210> better<00:04:28.750> your<00:04:29.050> buds<00:04:29.350> that

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
next iteration or better your buds that

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.480 
next iteration or better your buds that
will<00:04:29.950> actually<00:04:30.340> stay<00:04:30.640> inside<00:04:31.210> your<00:04:31.960> ear

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
will actually stay inside your ear

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.860 
will actually stay inside your ear
instead<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.670> falling<00:04:33.940> out<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.240> improve<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
instead of falling out and improve the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.650 
instead of falling out and improve the
connectivity<00:04:35.430> other<00:04:36.430> than<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.210> do<00:04:37.300> like

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
connectivity other than that I do like

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.920 
connectivity other than that I do like
more<00:04:38.140> than<00:04:38.770> my<00:04:38.830> Apple<00:04:39.640> headphones

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930
