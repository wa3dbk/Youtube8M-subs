00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 well first a news now the two 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 nine are going to be top 6 were going to be 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.719
 weekly so I'm going to expect a top 6 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 weekly of any topic that happens to me 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.839
 for the mind because the top 9 does the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.760
 script is something very very heavy for me and 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 that's why I do not get them now go 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.090
 to be top 6 and they will come out each end of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.519
 good week that's it and we start with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.599
 the good thing first of all I want to clarify 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.429
 that this is the first time that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.439
 opinion is not mine but from the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.020
 community based on collected data 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 in lol kin in which you can order the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 Champions to enroll less popular 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.170
 and therefore I imagine that the least 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.739
 dear ones like that who do many of them 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.739
 let us begin 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 number 6 pop and poor the top being the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
 most popular of the blacklist I think 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 that the champion has a lot of potential and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.660
 it has a horribly high damage has 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.520
 a study can endure and mobility 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.670
 I think he's a pretty champion 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.060
 complete but there is something that makes you 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.490
 disgusting and it's your model ring is very 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.160
 ugly and little nice to look at 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.970
 please give a hand to this poor 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.970
 ugly thing 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 number 5 diamonds 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.310
 the rhombus player a couple of times and not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.230
 long ago and legendary not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.550
 I'm surprised it's one of the least 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.340
 sold from the history of vigo of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.400
 legends but not everything is bad since the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 skin is ultra kawaii desune but 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.730
 I think I could give it to a trapper 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.160
 most popular I do not see what is it worth in 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.470
 this field I do not understand why it is so 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.690
 unpopular is not the one that hurt the most 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 has ultimate buts forgiveness to all your 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.670
 sins and the generations to come 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.409
 number 4 points 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.820
 de vÃ­ctor can not talk much is one 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.009
 of which least game of this list already 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.870
 that I do not have it I 've only played with the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.300
 put in the weekly rotation does 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.550
 many yesterdays I like the idea that 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 I have a special itin and the same and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.940
 have an advantage the first levels 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.890
 but what I do not like is that I do not 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.650
 You can sell or at least erase or 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.930
 something like that and you have to give it yes or yes 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.420
 could you put something better in this 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 available space has a was an 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.120
 shield that at the same time is damage and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.300
 It has a laser beam and a cloud bar 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.280
 black hole but has no mobility is 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.300
 a very good combination of damage and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.820
 utility also as lux only that lux 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:54.520
 is a blonde is a blonde and blondes 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.520
 you do not progress them honrubia if she 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.580
 number 3 came out the green monkey with caps 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.080
 on the feet 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.940
 I have this champion just because I 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.800
 came in a package with a good handful of 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.200
 champions most people what 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.330
 can but I believe that your potential is 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.250
 in afe because I have it and did not want 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.070
 fill up with dust because it's just 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 It is ugly and horrible and I wanted to try it 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.020
 I gave him two or three games per 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.910
 each type of witt and conape destroys everything 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.030
 if you know how to move well it goes down a lot 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.700
 only useful when you're ap does not serve you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.710
 for absolutely nothing looking at the side 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.050
 good to the green cairn is that soon they will 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.970
 relaunch the champion this means that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.800
 they will change all the skills and 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.050
 the design of the champion with hope 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.440
 that is more used and I think what 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.440
 will achieve 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.060
 number 2 gallium gallium the old one by 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.069
 existence its passive and legal I is what 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.689
 that I like most about him half 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.599
 Magic resistance you have 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.459
 will become afe for galleon but of 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.099
 rest not much else that pleases me 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.760
 last and it could be highlighted as it forces 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.030
 to hit him 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.709
 aaron both grandecita and bouquets and the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.139
 cv it seems like a pop whose 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.200
 name I do not remember well the sad thing is that 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.389
 that has a skin that sad is 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.430
 that creative in legendary skiing and that 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.229
 someone uses it is weirder than seeing a 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:35.930
 green dog piloting a spaceship 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:38.300
 Mexican made with pizza number 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.490
 one burgos the deformed obese crab 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.650
 this is the perfect combination of how 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.750
 do everything wrong 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.699
 the design is ugly the concept is ugly 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.300
 the skills are ugly the textures 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.620
 they are ugly the voice is worse maybe and only 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.620
 maybe 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.870
 why this is a little played 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.940
 only once I played with him before 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.260
 I knew what the lines are, I mean 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.090
 a top bot mid and so on will be an idea 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.280
 that this cloud was in those times 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.100
 but that's not why you're going to say that a 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.440
 champion is bad good so the time that 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.000
 I played with him they gave me an overdone anal 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.160
 of cosmic proportions has zero 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.910
 mobility and I was a cloud in those 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.680
 then I did not know how to use it well but 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.260
 the bad experience left me a trauma 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.660
 so I never played again with 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.789
 him in my life and that's how I joined 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.979
 the many millions of people that 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.800
 they never play with burgos 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.690
 Well that was all for the top today if 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.889
 you like you can leave a thumbs up 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:44.360
 a comment or subscribe this top was 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.199
 the simplest of all that I have 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.020
 done because well this weekend or 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.330
 be on August 22 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.849
 We are Friday, Friday, August 22, 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.639
 my birthday has already passed when I have gone up 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.409
 this video 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.539
 this video will be out there on Sunday 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.919
 so I did it very short very short very 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.159
 short because I did not want to lose much 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.499
 time and spend the day with my family 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.419
 from my dad and family by 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.919
 part of my mom since my parents are 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.039
 divorced and we have to spend a day 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.749
 with them and another day with these others and 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.099
 It's like having two birthdays not because 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.099
 be in the same place at the same time 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:24.539
 I have to have two days of birthday 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:30.020
 how would you say how could you possibly 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:30.020
 vulgarly say her and good bye
