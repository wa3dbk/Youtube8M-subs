00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
stage so we have Bulbasaur these are the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
stage so we have Bulbasaur these are the
original<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.520> homey<00:00:38.910> let<00:00:39.210> me

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
original I think that's homey let me

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.580 
original I think that's homey let me
double<00:00:39.629> check<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:40.050> show<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.320> once<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
double check I'll show you once it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.020 
double check I'll show you once it
focuses<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> yes<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> says<00:00:44.040> let's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
focuses there we go so yes it says let's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
focuses there we go so yes it says let's
say<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.530> initials<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> some

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

Chinese<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.750> Japanese<00:00:48.780> writing<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.610> assuming

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
Chinese or Japanese writing I'm assuming

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
Chinese or Japanese writing I'm assuming
it's<00:00:51.210> Chinese<00:00:51.840> because<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.410> made<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's Chinese because it was made in

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
it's Chinese because it was made in
China<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.370> don't<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.570> gonna<00:00:54.690> focus<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
China I don't know it's gonna focus that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.060 
China I don't know it's gonna focus that
close<00:00:56.840> let's<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:58.140> week<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> go

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
close let's see week there we go

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
close let's see week there we go
so<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> says<00:00:59.789> Tomy<00:01:00.390> nothing<00:01:01.140> China<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.620> made<00:01:01.829> in

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.280 
so it says Tomy nothing China is made in
China<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.550> would<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> figure<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
China I would say this figure is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520 
China I would say this figure is
absolutely<00:01:04.949> great<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> paint<00:01:07.080> jobs<00:01:07.290> really

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
Bulbasaur seemed a lot more kind of

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.850 
Bulbasaur seemed a lot more kind of
chunky<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:16.979> chubby<00:01:17.520> maybe<00:01:18.439> whereas<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.650> he's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
chunky or chubby maybe whereas now he's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
kind of got a longer neck and I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.550 
kind of got a longer neck and I
preferred<00:01:21.659> him<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.380> he<00:01:22.470> was

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
preferred him like this because he was

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.160 
preferred him like this because he was
more<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> dinosaur

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
more I don't know kind of dinosaur

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
more I don't know kind of dinosaur
looking<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.740> mean<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.430> fits<00:01:26.700> things

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
looking I mean that kind of fits things

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.700 
looking I mean that kind of fits things
like<00:01:27.090> Bulbasaur<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> cross

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
like Bulbasaur I think it's like a cross

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.780 
like Bulbasaur I think it's like a cross
between<00:01:29.509> grass<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:31.229> creature<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
between grass like creature and a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.890 
between grass like creature and a
dinosaur<00:01:33.270> that's<00:01:33.390> worth<00:01:33.600> called<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
dinosaur that's worth called it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.100 
dinosaur that's worth called it
Bulbasaur<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:35.939> think<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.270> original

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
Bulbasaur I just think these original

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.630 
Bulbasaur I just think these original
figures<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.619> great<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> had<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:38.610> of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
figures are great I mean I had a lot of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.399 
figures are great I mean I had a lot of
them<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> kid<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.200> never

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
them when I was a kid and I never

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.960

actually<00:01:40.650> remember<00:01:41.070> seeing<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.929 
actually remember seeing this one when I
was<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> kid<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> saw<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.500> eBay<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990 
managed to find one and buy him in a lot
of<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:51.720> figures<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.790> Bob's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
of other figures as well so that's Bob's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.170 
of other figures as well so that's Bob's
lost<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> Kim<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.850> they'll<00:01:57.030> get

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
lost it Kim there and they'll get

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.499 
lost it Kim there and they'll get
Ivysaur<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> here's<00:01:59.759> honestly<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> thought<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
Ivysaur so here's honestly I thought a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
Ivysaur so here's honestly I thought a
little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.899> bigger<00:02:01.170> than<00:02:01.320> Bulbasaur<00:02:01.860> which

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
little bit bigger than Bulbasaur which

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
little bit bigger than Bulbasaur which
is<00:02:02.369> good<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> their<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
is good so it's kind of their kind of

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.859 
is good so it's kind of their kind of
keep<00:02:04.439> into<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> size<00:02:05.310> scale<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
keep into the size scale it's what I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.449 
keep into the size scale it's what I
don't<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:07.530> they<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.770> figures<00:02:08.069> all

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
don't like when they make figures all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.059 
don't like when they make figures all
the<00:02:08.640> same<00:02:08.849> size<00:02:09.200> yeah<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.349> might<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.560> something

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the same size yeah it might be something

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.850 
the same size yeah it might be something
like<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.660> Caterpie

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
like a Caterpie

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.700 
like a Caterpie
and<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.610> huge<00:02:14.510> dragon<00:02:14.870> eye<00:02:15.050> or<00:02:15.230> something<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
and a huge dragon eye or something and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.630 
and a huge dragon eye or something and
it's<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.860> same<00:02:16.100> size

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
it's the same size

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.760 
it's the same size
I<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:17.240> they've<00:02:17.360> tried<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.630> keep<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.740> a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
I think they've tried to keep it like a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.320 
I think they've tried to keep it like a
size<00:02:19.700> kind<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.270> scale<00:02:20.570> with<00:02:20.780> these<00:02:20.960> figures

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
size kind of scale with these figures

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.520 
size kind of scale with these figures
yes<00:02:23.330> here's<00:02:23.630> Ivy<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:23.960> obviously<00:02:24.200> now<00:02:24.410> you've

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
yes here's Ivy so obviously now you've

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.710 
yes here's Ivy so obviously now you've
got<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> bulb<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.580> kind<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.090> flush<00:02:26.510> things

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
got the bulb that's kind of flush things

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.990 
got the bulb that's kind of flush things
into<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> flower<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.580> leaves<00:02:28.820> are

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
into a flower and the leaves are

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.540 
into a flower and the leaves are
slightly<00:02:29.420> flexible<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.860> cool<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:31.400> not

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
slightly flexible which is cool but not

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.060 
slightly flexible which is cool but not
very<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.910> mean<00:02:31.970> they<00:02:32.180> do<00:02:32.240> still<00:02:32.720> stay<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.290> shape

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
very I mean they do still stay in shape

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.610 
very I mean they do still stay in shape
as<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.490> can<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:36.110> it's<00:02:36.290> got<00:02:36.380> all<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
as you can see again it's got all the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.400 
as you can see again it's got all the
marks<00:02:37.010> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.250> bomb<00:02:37.550> tomy<00:02:38.060> slight<00:02:38.840> scuff<00:02:39.170> mark

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
marks on the bomb tomy slight scuff mark

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.390 
marks on the bomb tomy slight scuff mark

they're these one in mint condition

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.180 
they're these one in mint condition
these<00:02:41.000> figures<00:02:41.360> now<00:02:41.600> extremely<00:02:42.320> old<00:02:42.530> they've

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
these figures now extremely old they've

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.880 
these figures now extremely old they've
gotta<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.490> what<00:02:43.850> like<00:02:44.060> 15<00:02:44.990> years<00:02:45.020> old<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.620> but

stick em right there and then of course

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.580 
stick em right there and then of course
Venusaur<00:02:53.510> which<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.810> even<00:02:54.050> bigger<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.500> could

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
Venusaur which is even bigger you could

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
Venusaur which is even bigger you could
probably<00:02:54.740> tell<00:02:55.040> cuz<00:02:55.310> I'm<00:02:55.400> using<00:02:55.580> before<00:02:56.420> my

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
probably tell cuz I'm using before my

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.290 
probably tell cuz I'm using before my
fingers<00:02:57.110> there<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.350> hold<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.620> up

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
fingers there to hold it up

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.080 
fingers there to hold it up
including<00:02:59.300> my<00:02:59.420> thumb<00:02:59.980> but<00:03:00.980> yet<00:03:01.130> anyway

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
obviously he's now got the huge flower

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.280 
obviously he's now got the huge flower
that's<00:03:04.490> come<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> top<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.810> lot<00:03:06.020> less

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
that's come on the top that's a lot less

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.670 
that's come on the top that's a lot less

paint<00:03:09.950> job<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.280> really<00:03:10.520> good<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.030> kind

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
paint job is really good and it's kind

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.510 
paint job is really good and it's kind
of<00:03:11.300> got<00:03:11.420> all<00:03:11.510> these<00:03:11.830> smudging<00:03:12.830> effects<00:03:13.160> Linus

of got all these smudging effects Linus

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.280 
of got all these smudging effects Linus
knows<00:03:13.760> it's<00:03:14.030> slightly<00:03:14.270> darker<00:03:14.750> there<00:03:14.959> as<00:03:15.050> well

well drop dip B again it's got the
markings<00:03:20.360> on<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.600> bottom<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.019> don't<00:03:21.440> know<00:03:21.650> what

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
markings on the bottom I don't know what

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.770 
markings on the bottom I don't know what
this<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.130> for<00:03:22.400> because<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.150> too<00:03:23.360> small

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
this is for because it's too small

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.390 
this is for because it's too small
they've<00:03:24.440> all<00:03:24.590> got<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.769> hole<00:03:24.980> in<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.190> bottom

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
they've all got a hole in the bottom

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.540 
they've all got a hole in the bottom
these<00:03:25.519> ones<00:03:26.380> it's<00:03:27.380> too<00:03:27.650> small<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.489> a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
these ones it's too small to be for a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.720 
these ones it's too small to be for a
pencil<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.100> don't<00:03:31.280> know<00:03:31.370> why<00:03:31.489> that's<00:03:31.610> there

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
pencil so I don't know why that's there

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.560 
pencil so I don't know why that's there
perhaps<00:03:32.030> they<00:03:32.360> clip<00:03:32.690> on<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:33.050> something<00:03:33.470> like<00:03:33.620> I

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
perhaps they clip on to something like I

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.390 
perhaps they clip on to something like I
don't<00:03:35.570> know<00:03:35.750> some<00:03:35.989> sort<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.230> scenery<00:03:36.500> piece<00:03:36.950> or

don't know some sort of scenery piece or
item<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.060> don't<00:03:38.239> know<00:03:38.709> but<00:03:39.709> yeah<00:03:39.860> these<00:03:40.040> three

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
item I don't know but yeah these three

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.030
