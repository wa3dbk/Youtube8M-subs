00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.820
 With glass you can play many 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.799
 forms creating different effects and 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.679
 figures from vases necklaces 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.659
 ashtrays tableware and even sinks that 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.820
 They can be carried through 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.799
 thermoformed glass technique that 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.170
 consists of merging two or several 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.480
 Painted glasses of different colors 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.820
 and we started doing it practically 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.280
 as a hobby because as my husband is 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.110
 architect is engaged in decoration and 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.720
 we started first by doing precisely 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.480
 you say in one of the small ovens what 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.059
 first thing you do is cut the pieces 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.929
 according to what one bases goes according to 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.850
 a centerpiece ashtray further 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.670
 Can paint or decorate with rust 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.829
 cobalt zinc oxide or manganese the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.429
 which gives color and life to each piece 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.670
 well what let it dry the color before 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.219
 of placing it on the mold on the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.530
 which one wants me to take the form by 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.589
 that is called merged because it takes 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.300
 also the form merges according 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.720
 to the mold that one reads 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.760
 propose to the video after drying 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.729
 gets into a furnace lined with quilt 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.420
 ceramic at a temperature of 800 30 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.010
 degrees 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.170
 you can also merge several 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.450
 bottles together and you can even 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.130
 fold a bottle in half to give it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.540
 the napkin shape for 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.420
 merge the bottles these 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.080
 crushed also has its process not 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.000
 it's just putting them in and they have to 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 carry a warm-up process 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.620
 let's say gradually to prevent the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.290
 sudden temperature change is made that 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.180
 the bottle is tested every piece is 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.210
 finally created and they have different 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 degrees of difficulty the most laborious is 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
 is because it is based on pure 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.750
 glass strips and you have to place strip 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.600
 by strip and in spaces more or less 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.910
 calculate it so it looks good and the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.040
 simplest is it is because of the great 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.900
 imagination and detail that they bring to 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.330
 these pieces the glass artists 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.880
 thermoformed consider this crafts 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 as an important part of his life says my 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.640
 husband who are rather like there is a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.250
 no more traditional work and they are now 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.280
 be part of him as his children because 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.260
 because it always ends up being cut and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.410
 Obviously when cutting, it takes its 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.930
 blood that's why he says his children are 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.910
 textures colors and different designs are 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.630
 can create with the glass technique 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.630
 we have formed
