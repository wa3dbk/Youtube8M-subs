00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
notice here if you look at the mini-map

notice here if you look at the mini-map
at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:29.550> time<00:00:29.760> i'll<00:00:29.910> try<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.210> pause<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
at the right time i'll try and pause it

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.100 
at the right time i'll try and pause it
is<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.260> Jax<00:00:31.529> comes<00:00:31.830> from<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.759> right<00:00:32.940> side<00:00:33.210> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
is that Jax comes from the right side so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
is that Jax comes from the right side so
let's<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.530> Susan's<00:00:34.950> pops<00:00:35.130> up<00:00:35.719> where<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
let's see Susan's pops up where are you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.889 
let's see Susan's pops up where are you
Jax<00:00:37.200> where<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> Jax<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:41.300> she<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.600> be

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
Jax where are you Jax and she should be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.520 
Jax where are you Jax and she should be
showing<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.379> soon<00:00:43.670> alright<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.530> immediately

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
showing up soon alright so immediately

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
showing up soon alright so immediately
he<00:00:46.710> popped<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.820> saw<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
he popped up right here and I saw that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.450 
he popped up right here and I saw that
and<00:00:48.420> he<00:00:48.480> was<00:00:48.629> walking<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.079> direction

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
and he was walking this direction

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.740 
and he was walking this direction
chances<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.670> he<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.239> popped<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.600> on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
chances are he would have popped up on

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439 
chances are he would have popped up on
this<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.440> he<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.860> doing<00:00:53.160> blue<00:00:53.449> or

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this side if he was doing blue or

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
this side if he was doing blue or
leashing<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.050> blue<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:56.070> saw<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
leashing for blue so because i saw that

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
leashing for blue so because i saw that
information<00:00:57.149> i<00:00:57.239> immediately<00:00:57.629> stopped<00:00:58.050> going

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
information i immediately stopped going

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
information i immediately stopped going
to<00:00:58.649> wolves<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.520> straight<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.149> invade

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to wolves and go straight for an invade

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.500 
to wolves and go straight for an invade
on<00:01:00.600> his<00:01:00.750> red<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.770> there's<00:01:02.149> no<00:01:03.149> chance

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on his red because there's no chance

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
on his red because there's no chance
pretty<00:01:04.320> much<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.979> make<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.189> back<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
pretty much that he can make it back to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.510 
pretty much that he can make it back to
his<00:01:05.850> red<00:01:06.299> after<00:01:07.140> stealing<00:01:07.380> mine<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> because

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
his red after stealing mine and because

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.950 
his red after stealing mine and because
he<00:01:08.610> can't<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.030> through<00:01:09.390> mid<00:01:09.570> he'd<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
he can't go through mid he'd have to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
he can't go through mid he'd have to
walk<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> long<00:01:10.650> way<00:01:10.680> otherwise<00:01:11.070> it'd

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
walk around the long way otherwise it'd

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
walk around the long way otherwise it'd
be<00:01:11.490> obvious<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> he<00:01:12.150> stole<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.510> red<00:01:12.720> even

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
be obvious that he stole my red even

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
be obvious that he stole my red even
though<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.770> obvious<00:01:13.979> anyway<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
though it was pretty obvious anyway so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.539 
though it was pretty obvious anyway so
you<00:01:15.330> see<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> drop<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> wart<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.710> basically

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you see here I drop a wart and basically

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.010 
you see here I drop a wart and basically
that<00:01:17.850> word<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.210> tell<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.630> anyone's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that word will tell me if anyone's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.550 
that word will tell me if anyone's
coming<00:01:19.080> especially<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:21.140> coming<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> stop<00:01:22.409> me

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
coming especially then coming to stop me

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
coming especially then coming to stop me
at<00:01:22.650> his<00:01:22.799> red<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> didn't<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
at his red but what I didn't know at the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390 
at his red but what I didn't know at the
time<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.930> later<00:01:25.320> realizes<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.890> he's<00:01:26.159> doing

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
time but later realizes that he's doing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.999 
time but later realizes that he's doing
blew<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> right<00:01:27.090> now<00:01:27.299> while<00:01:27.509> I'm<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:27.750> red<00:01:28.650> so

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
blew it right now while I'm doing red so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.539 
blew it right now while I'm doing red so
I<00:01:29.400> clear<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.590> i'm<00:01:31.590> still<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.950> 3<00:01:32.220> because

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
I clear this and i'm still not 3 because

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.960 
I clear this and i'm still not 3 because
i<00:01:32.579> never<00:01:32.700> took<00:01:33.090> an<00:01:33.270> extra<00:01:33.720> camp<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
i never took an extra camp so i go to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
i never took an extra camp so i go to
two<00:01:36.180> double<00:01:36.600> golems<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.259> give<00:01:37.290> me

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
two double golems and this will give me

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
two double golems and this will give me
the<00:01:37.590> level<00:01:37.829> three<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.040> i'm<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.479> thinking<00:01:39.479> at

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the level three and i'm also thinking at

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
the level three and i'm also thinking at
this<00:01:39.930> moment<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:41.220> right<00:01:41.430> behind<00:01:41.579> bot

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
this moment that I I'm right behind bot

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
this moment that I I'm right behind bot
so<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> might<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.689> able<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> free<00:01:43.229> gank

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so I might be able to get a free gank

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670 
so I might be able to get a free gank
and<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> second<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> look

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and as you see in a second here I look

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.260 
and as you see in a second here I look
down<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.070> Lane<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> its<00:01:47.640> Jonna<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> real

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
down in that Lane and its Jonna is real

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
down in that Lane and its Jonna is real
and<00:01:48.950> they're<00:01:49.950> both<00:01:50.100> philhealth<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.640> there's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and they're both philhealth so there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.950 
and they're both philhealth so there's
no<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.750> able<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
no way I'm really going to be able to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.969 
no way I'm really going to be able to
get<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> kill<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> immediately

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
get a kill there so I immediately

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.170 
get a kill there so I immediately
hightail<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.759> towards<00:01:54.149> mid<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.880> don't<00:01:56.880> gank

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
hightail it towards mid and I don't gank

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.719 
hightail it towards mid and I don't gank
immediately<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.860> sins<00:01:59.250> there<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
immediately because if sins there for a

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.069 
immediately because if sins there for a
counter<00:02:00.060> gank<00:02:00.270> i'm<00:02:00.450> probably<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.960> lose

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
counter gank i'm probably going to lose

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
counter gank i'm probably going to lose
the<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.560> too<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
not able to get onto zigs so I stunt him

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.339 
not able to get onto zigs so I stunt him
and<00:02:30.120> kind<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.360> run<00:02:30.480> away<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> bait<00:02:31.049> in<00:02:31.260> his

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.770 
and kind of run away to bait in his
charge<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.280> allows<00:02:32.580> digs<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.450> really

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
charge and that allows digs to really

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.710 
charge and that allows digs to really
take<00:02:34.260> full<00:02:34.709> advantage<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.849> his<00:02:36.150> range<00:02:36.420> and

then not lack of mobility without a

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.670 
then not lack of mobility without a
charge<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.510> lets<00:02:39.690> us<00:02:39.810> pick<00:02:39.959> up<00:02:40.019> too<00:02:40.349> easy
