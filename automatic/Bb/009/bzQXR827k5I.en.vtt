very<00:06:12.090> good

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
very good

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:27.680 
very good
let<00:06:14.099> me<00:06:14.190> check<00:06:14.340> it<00:06:14.520> stops<00:06:14.819> very<00:06:14.970> quickly

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.490 

and<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:28.590> is<00:06:29.060> it's<00:06:30.060> actually<00:06:30.630> more<00:06:30.780> physical<00:06:31.320> so

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
and it is it's actually more physical so

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.800 
and it is it's actually more physical so
that's<00:06:31.710> really<00:06:32.190> Gus<00:06:32.580> not<00:06:32.970> about<00:06:33.240> nature<00:06:33.660> them

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
that's really Gus not about nature them

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.590
