00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:10.749 

I<00:00:01.460> guess<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:03.060> never<00:00:03.500> maybe<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:05.960> started<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.630 

the<00:00:12.200> m107<00:00:13.200> T<00:00:13.650> truck

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.759 

first<00:00:17.640> video<00:00:17.970> I've<00:00:18.330> done<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:21.500> chassis<00:00:22.500> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
first video I've done the chassis and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.279 
first video I've done the chassis and
drivetrain<00:00:22.830> suspension<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.039> ancillary

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.389 

I'll<00:00:31.289> show<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> minute<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.189> wheels

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
I'll show you in a minute the wheels

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.870 
I'll show you in a minute the wheels
aren't<00:00:33.120> glued<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> they're<00:00:35.370> probably<00:00:35.520> fall

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
aren't glued on so they're probably fall

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.190 
aren't glued on so they're probably fall
off<00:00:37.040> but<00:00:38.040> basically<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
off but basically this can be a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
off but basically this can be a
long-term<00:00:41.930> vid<00:00:43.430> build<00:00:44.510> probably<00:00:45.510> good<00:00:45.629> once

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
long-term vid build probably good once

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.279 
long-term vid build probably good once
the<00:00:46.260> trucks<00:00:46.800> done<00:00:47.840> leave<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> although<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the trucks done leave it although a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
the trucks done leave it although a
while<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.059> do<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.949> m1a1<00:00:52.949> aims<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
while and then do the m1a1 aims it's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
while and then do the m1a1 aims it's
gonna<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.329> trailer<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.410> leave

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.020 

so<00:01:21.360> yeah<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> been<00:01:21.720> pretty<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.070> far<00:01:23.100> no

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so yeah it's been pretty good so far no

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.660 
so yeah it's been pretty good so far no
problems<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.860> pretty<00:01:26.100> much<00:01:26.250> falling

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
problems it's all pretty much falling

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
problems it's all pretty much falling
together<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.420> few<00:01:27.810> bits<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.140> oh<00:01:28.320> yeah<00:01:28.530> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
together a few bits of oh yeah it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:38.440 
together a few bits of oh yeah it's
nothing<00:01:29.210> too<00:01:30.210> difficult

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.719 

falling<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
falling off you can see on the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:51.630 
falling off you can see on the
suspension<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.850> drivetrain

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.840 

it's<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.510> front<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.140> back<00:01:53.350> actually<00:01:53.950> is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
it's the front and back actually is

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's the front and back actually is
movable<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:55.780> he<00:01:55.870> can<00:01:56.050> close<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.850> make<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
movable so he can close it just make you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
movable so he can close it just make you
look<00:01:58.240> straight<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.960> yeah<00:02:02.200> that's<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:02.650> fur

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
look straight say yeah that's it so fur

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.910 
look straight say yeah that's it so fur
head<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:05.860> guards<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.140> radiator<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.830> the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
head like guards and the radiator on the

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.690 
head like guards and the radiator on the
other<00:02:09.280> board<00:02:11.460> I've<00:02:12.460> put<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.060> man<00:02:14.700> violating

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
other board I've put so man violating

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100 
other board I've put so man violating
these<00:02:15.850> two<00:02:16.060> tanks<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.600> give<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> bit<00:02:17.020> of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
these two tanks to give it a bit of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.710 
these two tanks to give it a bit of
weight

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
weight

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.240 
weight
yeah<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:20.020> all<00:02:20.140> being<00:02:20.320> pretty<00:02:20.560> good<00:02:20.650> clip<00:02:20.950> I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
probably done the cab I've seen it a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.330 
probably done the cab I've seen it a
little<00:02:36.820> long<00:02:37.030> tied<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.900> pound<00:02:38.770> to<00:02:38.950> my<00:02:39.100> stats

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340
