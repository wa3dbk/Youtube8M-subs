believe<00:02:31.739> despair<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.730> stronger<00:02:33.209> than<00:02:33.330> hope

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
believe despair is stronger than hope

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.920 
believe despair is stronger than hope
power<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:35.100> superior<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:36.030> compassion<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
power is superior to compassion and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.289 
power is superior to compassion and
might<00:02:37.800> makes<00:02:38.310> right<00:02:39.079> why<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.730> life<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.239> death

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
might makes right why the life and death

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.410 
might makes right why the life and death
of<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> first<00:02:43.079> century<00:02:43.440> Jew<00:02:43.769> named<00:02:44.100> Jesus<00:02:44.640> makes

of a first century Jew named Jesus makes

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.020 
of a first century Jew named Jesus makes
a<00:02:45.660> difference<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:47.220> would<00:02:47.430> therefore<00:02:47.670> be

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
a difference it would therefore be

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.750 
a difference it would therefore be
foolish<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.930> say<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.860> death<00:02:50.100> has<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.549> last

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
foolish to say that death has the last

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.750 
foolish to say that death has the last
word<00:02:51.530> there<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.739> too<00:02:52.980> much<00:02:53.160> pain<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
word there is too much pain and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.630 
word there is too much pain and
suffering<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.780> world<00:02:54.989> today<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:56.430> for

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
suffering in the world today but for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
suffering in the world today but for
many<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.970> us<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.870> not<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.500> ultimate

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
many of us this is not the ultimate
