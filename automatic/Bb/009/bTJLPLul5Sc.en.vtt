00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
so let's talk about mastering new

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.830 
so let's talk about mastering new
repertoire<00:00:02.030> one<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.240> things<00:00:03.480> that<00:00:03.659> is

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
repertoire one of the things that is

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.930 
repertoire one of the things that is
very<00:00:04.170> important<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.740> getting<00:00:05.310> some<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.819> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
very important to getting some of the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.020 
very important to getting some of the
new<00:00:06.089> music<00:00:06.299> is<00:00:06.629> actually<00:00:07.400> getting<00:00:08.400> back<00:00:08.730> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
new music is actually getting back to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700 
new music is actually getting back to
the<00:00:09.150> things<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.540> we<00:00:09.690> actually<00:00:09.840> already<00:00:10.500> know

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the things that we actually already know

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
the things that we actually already know
meaning<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:12.000> there<00:00:12.179> are<00:00:12.269> many<00:00:12.480> exercises

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
meaning that there are many exercises

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.189 
meaning that there are many exercises
from<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.860> book<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.099> klase<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.929> Barry<00:00:15.929> Mann

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
from the book of klase and Barry Mann

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
from the book of klase and Barry Mann
and<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.039> crypts<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.850> German<00:00:18.359> books<00:00:18.539> which

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and the crypts the German books which

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.599 
and the crypts the German books which
actually<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.320> find<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.680> class<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.070> sum

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
actually you can find in the class a sum

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.759 
actually you can find in the class a sum
of<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.850> volumes<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.570> there<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.170> big

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
of the volumes in there and that big

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.480 
of the volumes in there and that big
book<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.660> patterns<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.619> help

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
book there are little patterns that help

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
book there are little patterns that help
us<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.789> remember<00:00:27.269> Clara<00:00:27.720> netic<00:00:28.080> things<00:00:28.920> sort

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
us to remember Clara netic things sort

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
us to remember Clara netic things sort
of<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.429> scales<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.330> our<00:00:30.449> pages<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.019> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of like scales on our pages but in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.350 
of like scales on our pages but in
different<00:00:31.560> patterns<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:33.090> can

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
different patterns so that then we can

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.680 
different patterns so that then we can
actually<00:00:33.770> apply<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.219> new<00:00:36.090> music<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
actually apply them to new music and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.160 
actually apply them to new music and
that<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:38.190> always<00:00:38.370> try<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.180> find<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that way we can always try to find the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
that way we can always try to find the
little<00:00:40.710> spots<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.460> are<00:00:41.570> familiar<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> us<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
little spots which are familiar to us so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
little spots which are familiar to us so
we<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> lock<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.829> those<00:00:44.160> things<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.969> know

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
we can lock into those things you know

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.569 
we can lock into those things you know
one<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> examples<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> think

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
one of the examples that I like to think

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.000 
one of the examples that I like to think
about<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> example<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.010> Nielsen

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
about is for example the Nielsen

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
about is for example the Nielsen
controller<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> those<00:00:51.059> pieces<00:00:51.270> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
controller is one of those pieces that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.680 
controller is one of those pieces that
is<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.770> tricky<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> lot<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> notes<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
is very tricky has a lot of notes and a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
is very tricky has a lot of notes and a
lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.230> things<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.770> bit<00:00:56.100> worked

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
lot of things are a little bit worked

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.049 
lot of things are a little bit worked
out<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.809> us<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> play<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.699> thing<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
out but for us to play but the thing is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.939 
out but for us to play but the thing is
that<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> piece<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.739> found

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that for a piece like that I have found

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
that for a piece like that I have found
that<00:01:02.460> there<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:02.969> four<00:01:03.420> common<00:01:03.629> keys<00:01:03.960> first<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that there are four common keys first of

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
that there are four common keys first of
all<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.680> practice<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.790> flat<00:01:06.060> major

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
all you can practice with a flat major

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
all you can practice with a flat major
right<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:06.960> warming<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> flat<00:01:08.159> major<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
right for warming up a flat major and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
right for warming up a flat major and
the<00:01:09.180> relative<00:01:09.600> minor<00:01:09.750> F<00:01:10.080> minor<00:01:10.409> C<00:01:10.920> sharp<00:01:11.159> minor

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the relative minor F minor C sharp minor

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.420 
the relative minor F minor C sharp minor
and<00:01:11.610> E<00:01:11.820> major<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.270> those<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.380> end<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.770> using<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
and E major and those you end up using a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
and E major and those you end up using a
lot<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> G<00:01:15.119> major<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> G<00:01:15.810> minor<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.259> example

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
lot and G major and G minor for example

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
lot and G major and G minor for example
just<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> introduction<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.970> sorry<00:01:18.150> I'm

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
just the introduction I'm sorry I'm

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520 
just the introduction I'm sorry I'm
going<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.630> playing<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.990> B<00:01:19.140> flat<00:01:19.170> because

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
going to be playing on B flat because

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
going to be playing on B flat because
this<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.580> us<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.240> thinking<00:01:21.390> about

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this is just for us to be thinking about

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
this is just for us to be thinking about
how<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.290> better<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
how to get better you know we think of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.610 
how to get better you know we think of
the<00:01:23.759> computer

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.340 

and<00:01:30.620> we<00:01:30.890> are<00:01:30.950> always<00:01:31.430> hearing<00:01:32.300> how<00:01:32.780> many<00:01:33.110> times

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
and we are always hearing how many times

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.130 
and we are always hearing how many times
we<00:01:33.800> get<00:01:34.010> a<00:01:34.070> little<00:01:34.610> bit<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.090> little<00:01:35.720> bump<00:01:35.930> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
we get a little bit of a little bump and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.290 
we get a little bit of a little bump and
we<00:01:37.100> end<00:01:37.340> up<00:01:37.460> hearing<00:01:37.730> a<00:01:37.790> lot<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:37.970> people<00:01:38.180> that

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
we end up hearing a lot of people that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.690 
we end up hearing a lot of people that
end<00:01:38.450> up<00:01:38.570> having<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.810> adjust<00:01:42.130> well<00:01:43.130> that's<00:01:43.400> also

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
end up having to adjust well that's also

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.150 
end up having to adjust well that's also
because<00:01:43.970> we<00:01:44.630> are<00:01:44.780> not<00:01:44.960> used<00:01:45.320> to<00:01:45.500> using<00:01:45.830> our

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
because we are not used to using our

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.390 
because we are not used to using our
keys<00:01:46.370> properly<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.090> can<00:01:47.240> go<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.950> then

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
keys properly so we can go and then

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:06.910 
keys properly so we can go and then
playing<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.880> flat<00:01:53.120> major<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.350> that's<00:02:06.560> basically

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
playing a flat major so that's basically

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.609 
playing a flat major so that's basically
the<00:02:07.460> beginning<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.869> have<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.170> be<00:02:09.290> very

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619
