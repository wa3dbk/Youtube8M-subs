00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.690
 yes hello together would have come to 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.640
 resolution of the 5000 subscribers 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.080
 sweepstakes and in time it now 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.610
 Not so much time has passed since then 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.679
 the 5000 subscribers have complained 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.539
 We already have over 400 new subscribers here 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.640
 on the channel and that really right 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.050
 cool as all of you are doing as many people 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.449
 participated in the contest 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.859
 this time it was over 200 people 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.109
 but I think so 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.099
 Good chance for you from the random spot 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.200
 to be pulled 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.530
 yes and I just thanks again to all 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.699
 Participants to all the people that way 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.320
 a lot on the canal are a lot 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.670
 just comment and the people the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.469
 just like to look really cool 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.300
 of you and yes now just the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.190
 resolution on published you will 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 with your mahner base account and what 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.940
 I do not have your address yet 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.190
 little by little if I now have the four 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.719
 As I said before, prices present everything 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.100
 at random among the 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.969
 Entries are drawn 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.440
 and yes we'll look at who 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.969
 it's all about a poster 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.769
 you only have that on facebook 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.290
 then posted the two in front of folder as in 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.060
 video and that one from the volt package and 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.830
 which is important now if you win 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.590
 have me write a private one 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.380
 message on my base is important 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.070
 of course the same account with the same 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 to write the right code and me 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.120
 need your full name street 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.530
 house number post code city and country 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.750
 often mostly cognizant fans 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.830
 Austria is coming to recognize me now 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 the first look but if I and how 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.580
 I'm in stress and send the things 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.600
 then it can be that somehow 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.980
 maybe a small mistake is made 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.180
 So just the complete address 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.490
 I make prints that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.690
 address stickers usually 80 so 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.350
 that on the correct address 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.540
 send with all your information on it and 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.540
 yes now without much back and forth that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 video is also very simple and we 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.450
 look at us now very fast for the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 winner of the poster, as I said 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.800
 on request signed painted et cetera 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 just go in with the registered mail 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.880
 to the user kangoo then the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.060
 very first or the first goes on site 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.060
 on 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 bj i'm not sure how to do that 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.290
 So sometimes your name is pronounced 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.140
 Please forgive me the name exotics 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.069
 the second one appears in front of the folder 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.989
 at princess pia and the drum roll 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:28.209
 the front the concept goes smart 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.670
 underlined 0 07 91 82 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.530
 okay those are the winners hearty 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540
 Congratulations to you, of course it will 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.099
 continue to give small giveaways though 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.080
 I as a little go out sometimes 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.580
 playmates or something I always do that 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.780
 exclusively via facebook so it 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.980
 often worth it in on my it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.690
 facebook page to watch or simply 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.829
 then easier to let against, too 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.540
 on things out the big win 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.549
 of course he will say players here 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.630
 so again on the channel not sad 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.980
 there will still be a lot to win 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.849
 Give everyone a chance to be equal 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.329
 opportunities for everyone 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.769
 and yes thanks again and I hope that 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.540

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.880
