oh<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> choose<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.780> arbitrary<00:01:01.350> name

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
oh you have to choose an arbitrary name

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
oh you have to choose an arbitrary name
they<00:01:01.980> might<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.309> necessarily<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
they might not necessarily know is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
they might not necessarily know is
chapter<00:01:03.750> 3i<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.860> cutting<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.369> videos

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
chapter 3i so I'm cutting these videos

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
chapter 3i so I'm cutting these videos
and<00:01:06.000> organizing<00:01:06.600> them<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:07.020> think<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and organizing them because i think the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
and organizing them because i think the
chapter<00:01:07.920> names<00:01:08.189> are<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.970> people<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.510> going

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
chapter names are what people are going

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.750 
chapter names are what people are going
to<00:01:09.900> look<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.890> they<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.460> guide

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to look for when they use my guide

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.310 
to look for when they use my guide
because<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.689> gonna<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> most

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because that's gonna be the most

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
because that's gonna be the most
significant<00:01:14.010> name<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
significant name that they think that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
significant name that they think that
they<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> if<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.400> stuck<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
they can think of if they're stuck on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.210 
they can think of if they're stuck on
the<00:01:17.939> need<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> search<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.570> something<00:01:18.750> online

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
the need to search for something online

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.219 
the need to search for something online
but<00:01:20.360> if<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:21.540> trying<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.930> back<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
but if you're trying to go back and

if you want to start at the chip
beginning<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.380> chapter<00:01:28.530> 12<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.220> something

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
beginning of chapter 12 or something

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.660 
beginning of chapter 12 or something
like<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.729> yeah<00:01:30.270> well<00:01:30.990> anyway<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
like that yeah well anyway so now you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.749 
like that yeah well anyway so now you
run<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> auger<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.729> hard<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
run into the auger and it's hard to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.069 
run into the auger and it's hard to
imagine<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.210> you're<00:01:36.630> starting<00:01:36.900> with

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
imagine that you're starting with

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.130 
imagine that you're starting with
resistance<00:01:37.650> 3<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.119> resist<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.630> auger<00:01:39.990> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
resistance 3 but resist the auger in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.600 
resistance 3 but resist the auger in
resistance<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:41.040> cool<00:01:41.189> gun<00:01:41.430> um<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:43.610> its

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
resistance is really cool gun um it its

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.950 
resistance is really cool gun um it its
primary<00:01:44.939> fire<00:01:45.479> goes<00:01:45.930> through<00:01:46.320> walls<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.960> if

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
primary fire goes through walls and if

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.109 
primary fire goes through walls and if
you<00:01:49.500> scoped<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.950> with<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.729> people

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you scoped in with it you can see people

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.170 
you scoped in with it you can see people
through<00:01:51.360> walls<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:52.170> far<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:53.070> perfect<00:01:53.970> dark

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
through walls like far I in perfect dark

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.980

does so if you're shooting people like
across<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> map<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.560> multiplayer<00:02:11.039> with<00:02:11.250> an

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
across the map and multiplayer with an

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.980 
across the map and multiplayer with an
auger

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
auger

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.720 
auger
I<00:02:13.080> don't<00:02:13.650> know<00:02:13.770> if<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.220> get<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.490> one

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
I don't know if you can get like a one

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.470 
I don't know if you can get like a one
hit<00:02:14.910> kill<00:02:15.050> but<00:02:16.050> um<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.670> every<00:02:18.180> time<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
hit kill but um but every time the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.140 
hit kill but um but every time the
bullets<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:18.870> through<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.650> another<00:02:20.150> section

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
bullets go through like another section

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210 
bullets go through like another section
of<00:02:21.300> wall<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.930> kind<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.230> pauses<00:02:22.470> for<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> second

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
of wall it kind of pauses for a second

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.380 
of wall it kind of pauses for a second
or<00:02:23.310> two<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.640> they're<00:02:23.760> actually<00:02:24.120> moving

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
or two so if they're actually moving

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.480 
or two so if they're actually moving
it'd<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.170> very<00:02:25.200> hard<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.740> hit<00:02:25.830> people<00:02:26.130> it's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
it'd be very hard to hit people it's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.670 
it'd be very hard to hit people it's
just<00:02:26.760> for<00:02:26.910> standing<00:02:27.360> still<00:02:27.660> right<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:28.500> if

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
just for standing still right so if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
just for standing still right so if
someone's<00:02:29.010> not<00:02:29.040> playing<00:02:29.580> maybe<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.510> could

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
someone's not playing maybe you could

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.660 
someone's not playing maybe you could
like<00:02:30.840> get<00:02:31.110> them<00:02:31.230> across<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.650> map<00:02:31.860> yeah<00:02:32.310> but

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
like get them across the map yeah but

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.750 
like get them across the map yeah but
anyway<00:02:33.560> then<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> secondary<00:02:35.070> fire<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.580> this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
anyway then the secondary fire on this

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.090 
anyway then the secondary fire on this
creates<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.270> shield<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.950> shoot

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
creates a shield that you can shoot

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.260 
creates a shield that you can shoot
through<00:02:38.400> when<00:02:39.360> you're<00:02:39.480> using<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> auger<00:02:41.270> so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
through when you're using the auger so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.550 
through when you're using the auger so
it<00:02:42.390> instantly<00:02:42.750> makes<00:02:42.960> your<00:02:43.110> bullets<00:02:43.380> more

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it instantly makes your bullets more

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.690 
it instantly makes your bullets more
powerful<00:02:44.010> yes<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:46.410> protects<00:02:46.740> you<00:02:46.860> but

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
powerful yes and it protects you but

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.670 
powerful yes and it protects you but
other<00:02:47.850> augers<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.540> go<00:02:48.660> through<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.560> if

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
other augers can go through it so if

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.420 
other augers can go through it so if
you're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:50.490> ahead<00:02:50.640> against<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
you're going up ahead against a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.940 
you're going up ahead against a
steelhead<00:02:53.430> just<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> name<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.260> unit<00:02:55.830> that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
steelhead just the name of the unit that

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.270 
steelhead just the name of the unit that
carries<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.460> augurs<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:59.100> don't

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
carries the augurs then they don't

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.710 
carries the augurs then they don't
really<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.640> shit<00:02:59.670> I<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:03.270> yeah<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.600> was

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
really do shit I see so yeah that was

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.770 
really do shit I see so yeah that was
the<00:03:03.750> kind<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.110> order<00:03:04.470> tutorial<00:03:05.100> section<00:03:05.780> it

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the kind of order tutorial section it

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.360 
the kind of order tutorial section it
seems<00:03:07.170> pretty<00:03:07.380> early<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.010> getting<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
seems pretty early to be getting the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.520 
seems pretty early to be getting the
auger<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.510> such<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> cool<00:03:09.990> weapon<00:03:10.410> you

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
auger it's like such a cool weapon you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.210 
auger it's like such a cool weapon you
think<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:10.890> it'd<00:03:11.100> be<00:03:11.310> more<00:03:11.490> like<00:03:11.550> an<00:03:11.910> endgame

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
think that it'd be more like an endgame

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.100 
think that it'd be more like an endgame
um<00:03:14.420> yeah<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.690> guess<00:03:16.640> sure<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.840> how<00:03:18.900> does<00:03:18.960> this

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
um yeah I guess sure so how does this

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.050 
um yeah I guess sure so how does this
one<00:03:19.470> stack<00:03:19.710> up<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.160> i<00:03:20.190> guess<00:03:20.610> i<00:03:20.760> should<00:03:20.940> mention

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
one stack up so i guess i should mention

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.310 
one stack up so i guess i should mention
that<00:03:21.270> if<00:03:21.540> you're<00:03:21.660> playing<00:03:21.840> through<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.140> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that if you're playing through this the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.780 
that if you're playing through this the
first<00:03:22.530> time<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:22.980> haven't<00:03:23.310> upgraded<00:03:23.460> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
first time and you haven't upgraded the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.120 
first time and you haven't upgraded the
auger<00:03:23.970> too<00:03:24.360> far<00:03:24.660> you'll<00:03:25.560> probably<00:03:25.770> notice

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
auger too far you'll probably notice

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.420 
auger too far you'll probably notice
that<00:03:26.520> when<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.420> shoot<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.080> auger<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:29.250> has<00:03:29.400> three

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
that when I shoot the auger it has three

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.090 
that when I shoot the auger it has three
bullets<00:03:30.060> coming<00:03:30.240> out<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.690> yeah<00:03:30.960> I<00:03:31.740> think

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
bullets coming out of it yeah I think

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.020 
bullets coming out of it yeah I think
you<00:03:32.400> get<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.150> level<00:03:33.660> two<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.850> auger

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you get that for level two of the auger

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.680 
you get that for level two of the auger
okay<00:03:37.160> level<00:03:38.160> three<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.550> auger<00:03:38.700> gets<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.390> a

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
okay level three of the auger gets you a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.680 
okay level three of the auger gets you a
shield<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.920> was<00:03:41.100> stands<00:03:41.340> more<00:03:41.580> damage<00:03:41.970> and

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.210 

and<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:46.110> three<00:03:46.470> levels<00:03:46.800> around<00:03:46.920> three

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
and that's it three levels around three

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220 
and that's it three levels around three
levels<00:03:47.520> yep<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.000> they<00:03:48.450> don't<00:03:48.600> correspond<00:03:49.140> to

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
levels yep and they don't correspond to

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.140 
levels yep and they don't correspond to
multiplayer<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.950> all<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.640> it's<00:03:50.850> not<00:03:50.910> like

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
multiplayer at all so it's not like

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.610 
multiplayer at all so it's not like
playing<00:03:51.540> single<00:03:51.810> players<00:03:51.990> lots<00:03:52.260> gonna<00:03:52.470> give

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
playing single players lots gonna give

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.440

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
someone writing exactly what my thoughts

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.890 
someone writing exactly what my thoughts
were<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:45.220> know<00:04:45.340> every<00:04:46.030> fight<00:04:46.360> comes

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900

but it's unplayable it's unplayable in
my<00:07:11.320> opinion<00:07:11.560> and<00:07:11.800> it's<00:07:11.890> not<00:07:11.980> because<00:07:12.040> of<00:07:12.580> our

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
my opinion and it's not because of our

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.220 
my opinion and it's not because of our
internet<00:07:13.420> connection<00:07:13.780> either<00:07:13.900> we<00:07:14.080> have<00:07:14.170> a

great<00:07:14.530> internet<00:07:14.890> connection<00:07:15.370> mm-hmm<00:07:15.790> it's

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
great internet connection mm-hmm it's

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.740 
great internet connection mm-hmm it's
who<00:07:17.260> knows<00:07:17.470> why<00:07:17.770> the<00:07:18.520> game<00:07:18.730> gets<00:07:19.090> unbelievably

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.080 
who knows why the game gets unbelievably
shitty<00:07:20.320> framerates<00:07:20.680> and<00:07:21.310> I<00:07:21.580> I<00:07:21.790> don't

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
shitty framerates and I I don't

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.490 
shitty framerates and I I don't
necessarily<00:07:22.180> think<00:07:22.570> it's<00:07:22.840> lag<00:07:23.020> I<00:07:23.230> think<00:07:23.410> it's

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
necessarily think it's lag I think it's

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.860 
necessarily think it's lag I think it's
just<00:07:23.670> poorly<00:07:24.670> designed<00:07:24.880> with<00:07:25.360> really<00:07:25.750> bad

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
just poorly designed with really bad

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.070 
just poorly designed with really bad
frame<00:07:26.230> rates<00:07:26.500> hmm
