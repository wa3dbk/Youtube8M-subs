 in the subsequent prologue of these 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.000
 letters the author gives news about the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.859
 composition of the book which 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.040
 presents as a compendium of the five 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:02.769
 Jasson's books say in the first 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.599

 Maccabees with their seven children the rest 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.120
 of the book is dedicated exclusively to 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.150
 Judas Macabeo whose story is told 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.670
 until the victory over nicanor 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
 As for the composition, it is believed that 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.159
 the first book was written by an author 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.010
 Palestinian in Hebrew language around 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:36.069
 of the year 100 before Christ and translated 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.280
 shortly after the Greek San Jeronimo saw 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.439
 still the Hebrew text the second book 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.290
 in but it was written in Greek as 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.959
 easily test your style 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.750
 composition is prior to that of reads to 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.150
 of the first 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.630
 and it has to be fixed a little after the year 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.270
 160 BC therefore fails to 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.470
 refer to the jónatas and the 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.810
 Simón that are narrated in the first book 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.550
 the purpose and object of the two books is not 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.860
 only give a historical exhibition 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.370
 of wars against the most powerful 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.920
 oppressors of israel but also and more 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.140
 still highlight the tremendous 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.480
 evidence that the town suffered the village 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.269
 chosen for wanting to imitate the pagans 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.160
 and highlight the help of the divine 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.610
 providence in which she struggles of life 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.740
 or death that humanly speaking there would be 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.070
 due to having as a consequence the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.500
 annihilation of the small Jewish people if 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.510
 this did not happen if the course of 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.570
 history took an opposite direction to all 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.880
 human expectation we are authorized and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.400
 obliged and obliged to attribute it to the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.500
 intervention of the high one that once 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.860
 more he was kind to his people 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.190
 which was born shortly after the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.670
 Messiah 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.720
 the second book emphasizes more the character 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.660
 uplifting and comforting of the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.850
 historical events exhorting 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.400
 the celebration of the holidays 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.410
 reverence to the temple to constancy in 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.870
 the persecution of faith in the 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.080
 resurrection and hope in the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.140
 eternal reward in the chronology 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.270
 the two books follow the era of the 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:22.130

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.140

 missing missing the Hebrew text 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.610
 we follow with slight changes the version 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.030
