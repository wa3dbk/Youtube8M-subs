00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
breaking it up by breaking into years by

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.569 
breaking it up by breaking into years by
breaking<00:03:32.090> into<00:03:32.299> months<00:03:32.660> I'm<00:03:33.380> able<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.799> add<00:03:34.160> and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
breaking into months I'm able to add and

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.059 
breaking into months I'm able to add and
and<00:03:34.790> I'm<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.390> my<00:03:35.510> way<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.590> know<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:36.950> I've

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
and I'm on my way you know so I've

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.890 
and I'm on my way you know so I've
already<00:03:37.340> kind<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.640> changed<00:03:38.569> my<00:03:38.690> thought

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
already kind of changed my thought

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.140 
already kind of changed my thought
process<00:03:39.380> there<00:03:39.590> where<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.549> didn't<00:03:40.880> seem<00:03:40.970> but

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
process there where it didn't seem but

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150 
process there where it didn't seem but
seem<00:03:41.390> achievable<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.230> does<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.950> when<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
seem achievable now it does so when the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.699 
seem achievable now it does so when the
price<00:03:43.340> dips<00:03:43.609> down<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:43.940> 28<00:03:44.389> 29<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.989> can't<00:03:45.350> wait<00:03:45.560> to

the<00:04:29.440> markets<00:04:29.800> red<00:04:29.979> hot<00:04:30.220> first<00:04:30.910> of<00:04:31.030> all<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.210> think

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
the markets red hot first of all I think

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.510 
the markets red hot first of all I think
it's<00:04:31.750> just<00:04:31.960> artificially<00:04:32.259> pumped<00:04:32.860> up<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:33.250> I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
it's just artificially pumped up I do I

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.760 
it's just artificially pumped up I do I
think<00:04:33.639> all<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.539> money<00:04:35.139> printing<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.680> that

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
think all this money printing and that

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.020 
think all this money printing and that
everything<00:04:36.130> else<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.400> making<00:04:36.610> its<00:04:36.820> way<00:04:36.940> into

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
everything else is making its way into

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.760 
everything else is making its way into
the<00:04:37.180> market<00:04:37.509> I<00:04:37.660> don't<00:04:38.080> think<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.289> fundamental

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the market I don't think the fundamental

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.930 
the market I don't think the fundamental
picture<00:04:39.039> has<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.430> changed<00:04:39.789> that<00:04:39.880> much

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940
