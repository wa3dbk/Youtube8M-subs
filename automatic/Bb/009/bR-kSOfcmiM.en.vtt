is a bayonet remove it from the sheath

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.509 
is a bayonet remove it from the sheath
held<00:00:20.789> on<00:00:20.970> by<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> Velcro<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.830> just<00:00:22.830> staying<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
held on by a Velcro or just staying in

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.880 
held on by a Velcro or just staying in
place<00:00:23.699> by<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> Velcro<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.630> cool<00:00:25.439> looking

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
place by a Velcro it's a cool looking

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.519 
place by a Velcro it's a cool looking
bayonet<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.939> an<00:00:27.029> m9<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.170> name<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
bayonet I think it's an m9 the name of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.020 
bayonet I think it's an m9 the name of
it<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> ring<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.980> barrel<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it this is the ring for the barrel and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840 
it this is the ring for the barrel and
then<00:00:33.450> these<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> clips<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.670> an

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
then these are the clips that go into an

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.319 
then these are the clips that go into an
m4<00:00:36.440> here's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.530> m4<00:00:37.800> barrel<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.120> thing

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
m4 here's a m4 barrel it has this thing

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.040 
m4 here's a m4 barrel it has this thing
on<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> underneath<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> front<00:00:41.190> post<00:00:41.520> site<00:00:42.050> you

on it underneath the front post site you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.549 
on it underneath the front post site you
could<00:00:43.260> slip<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> bayonet<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> barrel

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
could slip the bayonet on to the barrel

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.360 
could slip the bayonet on to the barrel
and<00:00:46.850> clip<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.260> into<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.190> stays

right off the blade of the knife is made

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
right off the blade of the knife is made
out<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.270> rubber<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> uh<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.670> kind<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
out of rubber but it's uh it's kind of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thick rubber so just simple stabbing

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.950 
thick rubber so just simple stabbing
motions<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.450> gonna<00:01:12.720> go

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
motions like this it's not gonna go

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.469 
motions like this it's not gonna go
straight<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> doing<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.220> anything<00:01:14.479> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
takes quite a lot of force to get it to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.070 
takes quite a lot of force to get it to
move<00:01:17.220> around<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.189> uh<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.540> keeps<00:01:21.869> its

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
move around so it it uh it keeps its

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.609 
move around so it it uh it keeps its
shape<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.460> very<00:01:23.700> uh<00:01:24.290> I'm<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.439> very

educated<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.250> knives<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.180> these

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
educated on knives but it's got these

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.789 
educated on knives but it's got these
serrations<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> blade<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
serrations in the blade it's got this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.030 
serrations in the blade it's got this
hole<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.340> which<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:32.729> seen<00:01:33.740> like<00:01:34.740> has

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
hole here which I've seen like has

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.929 
hole here which I've seen like has
something<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.689> sheath<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.700> goes

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
something to do with the sheath it goes

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.850 
something to do with the sheath it goes
on<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.930> turns<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.619> don't

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
on like that and then this turns I don't

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.210 
on like that and then this turns I don't
know<00:01:40.979> why<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.189> fell

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.480 

so<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.180> blade<00:01:48.480> is<00:01:48.630> rubber<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so the blade is rubber and then the the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.190 
so the blade is rubber and then the the
mount<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> plastic<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.660> whole<00:01:51.810> grip<00:01:52.050> is

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
mount is plastic the whole grip is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.000 
mount is plastic the whole grip is
plastic<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> mounting<00:01:54.630> lever<00:01:58.010> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
plastic and so is the mounting lever the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.950 
plastic and so is the mounting lever the
rubber<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.610> wasn't<00:02:00.270> machine<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:00.720> well

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
rubber is a wasn't machine very well

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.010 
rubber is a wasn't machine very well
there's<00:02:01.230> kind<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.830> like<00:02:01.980> Harry<00:02:02.810> messed<00:02:03.810> up

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
there's kind of like Harry messed up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.680 
there's kind of like Harry messed up
right<00:02:04.350> there<00:02:05.240> long<00:02:06.240> indent<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.080> blade

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
right there long indent in the blade

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
right there long indent in the blade
kind<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:09.899> diamond<00:02:10.700> diamond<00:02:11.700> checkered

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
kind of like diamond diamond checkered

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.530 
kind of like diamond diamond checkered
patterns<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.410> grip<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> base<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
patterns on the grip and at the base of

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.700 
patterns on the grip and at the base of
