00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.460
 Welcome to a new supplier 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 I just paint over it for us 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.690
 could see again something fine for 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.940
 unpack you and that the asus 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.500
 Sinn watch is on my wishlist 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 and that 's why I asked if we could 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 you can test and now we have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.289
 they here more so brought the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.609
 easter bunny what was technology and therefore 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 we do not unpack the thing I do 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 they are visually totally responsive and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.790
 I wanted to know what's in it for me 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.070
 and I am brand new I am 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.149
 virgin in the matter so so 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 is the pack how to load it 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.890
 does not get much there is already the clock 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.809
 is still fast that means we are 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.059
 We'll take care of that later 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.260
 look what else is so grint and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.260
 Although so elegantly packed 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 otherwise you have nothing here only 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 three his little waves 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.130
 so that was it again plug for 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.080
 the wall and a micro usb cable 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 get out and a bit for the title 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.100
 You can not see for sure yet 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.229
 if he is this time 1 5 am heer 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.740
 single points three fifth a coach 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.590
 one more turn on couple 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.820
 that's difficult is great by the way 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 your own app has its own asus zenbook 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.820
 Asia 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 interesting that means we can 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.880
 now at the main feature and indeed um 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.409
 the clock service itself i believe that 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.420
 not everything is exactly that yet 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 that is, we are even worse 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 still this this loader carrier 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.180
 thing was there was just great 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 Hanging up and loading but as you see 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.030
 then I should stand or still know 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.289
 Not 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 The problem was there at that time 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.360
 already with samsung at the cracks theirs 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.130
 exactly devices where it was even there 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.570
 a bowl to the drum clack this time 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.250
 very new to clean that is yes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.039
 actually already user-friendly 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.539
 many also have the clock at that time 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.580
 Greed live directly with this shell 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 set up for various is because is there 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.350
 it always accessories with you super 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.750
 otherwise we have in stainless steel housing 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.060
 on 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.000
 an amoled display and a correct one 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.069
 nice leather bracelet that I think has 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 really great, these are too 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.850
 of simplicity, then to cut 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 Of course it's also a nice thing 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.709
 and together there is what you are on 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.730
 just stop me I had with you 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 maybe just great 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.950
 it fits my fat little ones here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.480
 my spokes are still watching 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.269
 set large or two smaller ones 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.280
 recognized set pretty noble I would have 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.500
 did not think 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.030
 from running time should also be as far as two to 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.340
 Three days are depending on how you get them 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
 I'm curious 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.019
 Now in comparison Apple Watch this 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.530
 One is just a real clock 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.660
 everything else is round and look at you 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.320
 You can even use commercially available bracelets 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.299
 use 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.070
 because here they are clinging to them 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.500
 little luxury away and you can do a whole 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.680
 normal so no 500 euro but 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.269
 synonymous times such a 80 50 euro set so 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 how it suits me, so I'm curious 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.819
 and 150 reduced 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.739
 gorilla glas the display has from the 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.060
 gorillaz as well as scratch resistant 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.750
 actually it should be 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.260
 horny so much to watch after the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.819
 unpacking 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.610
 there is now the enns or us 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.190
 be used for bowling resp 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.480
 Try and if you are not that long 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.680
 wanted to wait and already a bit 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.210

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.360
