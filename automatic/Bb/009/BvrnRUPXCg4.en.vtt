00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
handle but I got behind the wheel of a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.090 
handle but I got behind the wheel of a
thing<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.510> went<00:02:32.690> about<00:02:32.840> five<00:02:33.230> miles<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.800> hour<00:02:33.890> as

thing I went about five miles an hour as

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.560 
thing I went about five miles an hour as
you<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.490> imagine<00:02:34.580> it<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:35.330> could<00:02:35.450> really

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
you can imagine it but you could really

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.420 
you can imagine it but you could really
feel<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.960> scraping<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.830> snow<00:02:36.920> off<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
feel it scraping the snow off to the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
feel it scraping the snow off to the
side<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.120> was<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> neat<00:02:38.480> experience<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:39.260> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
side so it was a neat experience and I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.060 
side so it was a neat experience and I
think<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:39.620> something<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.920> would<00:02:40.040> work

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
think it's something that would work
