the car and for 2010 that has changed

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
the car and for 2010 that has changed
slightly<00:00:43.980> partly<00:00:44.700> through<00:00:44.850> regulations

slightly partly through regulations

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
slightly partly through regulations
where<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.950> conformity

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
where now we have to have one conformity

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.569 
where now we have to have one conformity
through<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.329> area<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.410> also<00:00:49.649> through<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
through this area but also through the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
through this area but also through the
safety<00:00:51.090> factor<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.289> these

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
safety factor and as you can see these

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470 
safety factor and as you can see these
very<00:00:52.949> distinctive<00:00:53.730> cones<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.210> front

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
very distinctive cones on the front

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
very distinctive cones on the front
that's<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.809> crash<00:00:55.140> structure<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.129> case<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that's a crash structure so in case of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
that's a crash structure so in case of
an<00:00:56.610> impact<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> drivers<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.020> very<00:00:58.289> very

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
an impact then the drivers are very very

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.790 
an impact then the drivers are very very
secure<00:00:58.980> from<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> ar-15<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:01.079> maintain<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
secure from the ar-15 we maintain the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
secure from the ar-15 we maintain the
philosophy<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.670> developed<00:01:03.180> even<00:01:03.270> further

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
philosophy but developed even further

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
philosophy but developed even further
but<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> line<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.010> efficiency<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
but in the line of efficiency now you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539 
but in the line of efficiency now you
can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> ar-15<00:01:07.740> plus<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
can see from the ar-15 plus it's a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
can see from the ar-15 plus it's a
little<00:01:08.850> bit<00:01:08.970> lower<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.080> bit

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
little bit lower it's a little bit

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.590 
little bit lower it's a little bit
sleeker<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.770> lines<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.939> defined

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
sleeker the lines are very very defined

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.649 
sleeker the lines are very very defined
but<00:01:12.900> clean<00:01:13.290> from<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> front<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:14.970> all

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
but clean from the front to the back all

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
but clean from the front to the back all
in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.049> name<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.530> straight<00:01:17.070> line<00:01:17.250> speed<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
in the name of straight line speed and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.980 
in the name of straight line speed and
better<00:01:18.240> deficiency

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.320 

now<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.050> hear<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.350> lot<00:01:23.440> about<00:01:23.620> aerodynamics<00:01:24.330> but

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
now we hear a lot about aerodynamics but

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.390 
now we hear a lot about aerodynamics but
we<00:01:25.570> can't<00:01:25.870> forget<00:01:26.110> mechanical<00:01:27.010> grip<00:01:27.220> and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
we can't forget mechanical grip and

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.180 
we can't forget mechanical grip and
suspension<00:01:28.180> underneath<00:01:28.900> here<00:01:29.410> we've<00:01:29.830> got<00:01:29.890> all

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
suspension underneath here we've got all

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.950 
suspension underneath here we've got all
the<00:01:30.310> suspension<00:01:30.730> geometry<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.510> car<00:01:31.780> and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
the suspension geometry of the car and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.840 
the suspension geometry of the car and
that<00:01:32.230> also<00:01:32.470> gives<00:01:32.830> us<00:01:33.070> grip<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.490> corners

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
that also gives us grip in the corners

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.000 
that also gives us grip in the corners
but<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.330> we've<00:01:34.720> developed<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.680> try<00:01:35.980> and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
but it we've developed it to try and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.820 
but it we've developed it to try and
enhance<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:37.300> right<00:01:37.600> quality<00:01:38.140> over<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.650> long

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
enhance the right quality over the long

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.070 
enhance the right quality over the long
distances<00:01:39.370> of<00:01:39.520> Lamar<00:01:39.820> now<00:01:40.810> there's<00:01:41.050> been

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080

efficient way out of that particular

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.280 
efficient way out of that particular
problem<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.630> what<00:02:01.780> we've<00:02:01.900> got<00:02:02.110> a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
problem and this is what we've got a

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.100 
problem and this is what we've got a
lost<00:02:02.710> sculpted<00:02:03.369> rear<00:02:03.580> end<00:02:03.790> with<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.270> very<00:02:04.720> very

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
lost sculpted rear end with a very very

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.790 
lost sculpted rear end with a very very
nice<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.680> find<00:02:05.920> strong<00:02:06.430> section<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.410> the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
nice to find strong section this is the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.200 
nice to find strong section this is the
view<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.310> want<00:02:09.850> all<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> opposition<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.780> see

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.320 

now<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.990> not<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.800> about<00:02:16.190> car<00:02:16.760> performance

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
now it's not just about car performance

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.600 
now it's not just about car performance
also<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> engineers<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:19.070> been<00:02:19.100> thinking

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
also the engineers have been thinking

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.790 
also the engineers have been thinking
very<00:02:19.820> hard<00:02:19.940> about<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.510> drivers<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.080> well<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
very hard about the drivers as well the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800 
very hard about the drivers as well the
ergonomics<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.670> comfort<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.480> seating

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
ergonomics the comfort of the seating

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.660 
ergonomics the comfort of the seating
position<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.680> things<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.310> steering

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
position but things like the steering

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.940 
position but things like the steering
wheel<00:02:25.820> where<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.170> buttons<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.800> switches

wheel where all the buttons and switches

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.280 
wheel where all the buttons and switches
are<00:02:28.370> are<00:02:28.610> they<00:02:28.970> an<00:02:29.090> easy<00:02:29.270> position<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:30.230> you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
are are they an easy position do you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.900 
are are they an easy position do you
have<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.830> think<00:02:31.010> about<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.550> have<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
have to think about it do you have to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.480 
have to think about it do you have to
look<00:02:32.060> or<00:02:32.270> are<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:32.990> instinctively<00:02:33.530> where<00:02:34.310> you

look or are they instinctively where you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.050 
look or are they instinctively where you

with a different number number seven but

we believe the odr 15 plus can bring the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
we believe the odr 15 plus can bring the
