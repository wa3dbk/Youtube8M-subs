a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.110> bit<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> came<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> little<00:00:35.190> bit

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
a little bit I came in a little bit

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.880 
a little bit I came in a little bit
puffy<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.510> cut<00:00:36.989> water<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:37.559> hard

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
puffy and so I cut water really hard

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010

yesterday<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> did<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> bunch<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.600> stuff<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
yesterday and did a bunch of stuff that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.950 
yesterday and did a bunch of stuff that
kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.260> broke<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:41.000> my<00:00:42.000> normal<00:00:42.329> patterns<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
kind of broke my my normal patterns I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.959 
kind of broke my my normal patterns I
you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.370> you're<00:00:44.520> lean<00:00:44.700> enough

you know I think if you're lean enough
you<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:45.660> need<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> tweak<00:00:46.110> hardly

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
