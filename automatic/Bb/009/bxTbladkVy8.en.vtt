00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 you can change survival you in 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 their way everyone has a way of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 change survival of asia with the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 file with the mend or with itunes 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.360
 then there you change as 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 you want to say and tim gunn so 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.610
 good to enter and I have here we 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.200
 we sit here super giner de traoré 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.789
 you're pre-carrying controls with me 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 skype but if you would the place 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.320
 only that I'm with hearing aids and not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.729
 I know if he is heard so good should 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.890
 have many and told us to present us 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.530
 I listened 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.870
 then up there analysis in minute 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.870
 so that the poor throne will not be heard 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.369
 well this is called power 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.259
 for pirate ccoo and the island 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.930
 good in this derby like millions 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.579
 melons and monthly millions and a 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.700
 subscribed in my good fortune that as 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:47.310
 puts the grass and sip and well then the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.799
 grass in which it is put but many 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.990
 they put it from in 12 exactly to 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.890
 everything I do not know from where from itunes and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.409
 you can take grass and put it there 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.929
 and in fact when you break grass I think 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.710
 are seeds we will see we will 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.520
 check 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.979
 yes yes yes yes indeed to the servers 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.230
 external potosí when you put the boom 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.740
 and apart from flowers it also comes out 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.260
 grass so good super cool there are two 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.959
 boats as you can notice and I think what 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.850
 from above is a volcano we are going to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.590
 check it and you what they see 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.310
 survival is in your home until you can 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.310
 make a series here 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.480
 or if it's a volcano 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.840
 that's going to see you power for example 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.060
 can make an adventure in their series in 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.900
 the one in which they simply come down here and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.910
 you already have and they go down and well obviously with 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.310
 careful and you can do a chapter like that 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.250
 It would be interesting if they are going to do 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.690
 a series please do not say that you 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.670
 I have the maps and it would be good if I 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.470
 give some credit 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.910
 because good and find the map in the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.880
 level that will be in the subscription 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.880
 in fact this map the youtube channel 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.430
 I do not know if the one who did this does not have 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 a YouTube channel so I can not 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.250
 leave it in the description so 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.650
 you can go through the forum and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.750
 download the good map in any case 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.920
 this would be the video of I hope that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.930
 you liked it has been like this please 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.100
 give me a little hand up favorites if 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.900
 they want it to be among the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.090
 favorites and those that I think so 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.040
 this channel should be bigger and so 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.750
 Give or subscribe if you want to see more 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.269
 videos of mine and wanted to support me to follow 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.610
 uploading videos because it says goodbye 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.590
 even with a greeting another one of the spray that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.709
 I was here as I told you on Skype and that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.930
 I'm going to be the intro and a single one is all 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.930
 Metro says goodbye just all goodbye
