birth<00:00:04.259> rates<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.650> full<00:00:04.890> moons<00:00:05.130> one<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.640> my

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
birth rates and full moons one of my

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.010 
birth rates and full moons one of my
favorites<00:00:06.180> they're<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> couple<00:00:06.779> of

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
favorites they're a couple of

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.140 
favorites they're a couple of
municipalities<00:00:07.919> where<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.700> birth<00:00:08.880> rates

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
municipalities where the birth rates

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.030 
municipalities where the birth rates
jump<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.870> during<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.469> full<00:00:10.679> moon<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
jump a little during the full moon and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.830 
jump a little during the full moon and
everyone<00:00:11.639> says<00:00:11.820> oh<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.210> gravity<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
everyone says oh it's the gravity in the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
everyone says oh it's the gravity in the
formula<00:00:13.230> yanking<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.009> baby<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> room

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
formula yanking the baby from the room

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.560 
formula yanking the baby from the room
you<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.870> I'm<00:00:16.139> thinking<00:00:17.180> maybe<00:00:18.180> there's

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
you know and I'm thinking maybe there's

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.730 
you know and I'm thinking maybe there's
another<00:00:18.840> explanation<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.600> if<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.869> if<00:00:22.289> you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
another explanation so if you if you

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
another explanation so if you if you
look<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.310> gestation<00:00:24.090> period<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
look at the gestation period of the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
look at the gestation period of the
human<00:00:25.230> female<00:00:25.699> it's<00:00:26.699> basically<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.420> 295

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
human female it's basically about 295

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.820 
human female it's basically about 295
days<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:29.220> from<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.449> date<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> mist<00:00:31.380> period

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
days not from the date of mist period

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.680 
days not from the date of mist period
but<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> actually<00:00:32.880> got<00:00:33.390> pregnant

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
but from when you actually got pregnant

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.400 
but from when you actually got pregnant
that's<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.530> number<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.890> matters<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.579> okay

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
that's the number that matters here okay

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.770 
that's the number that matters here okay
295<00:00:37.410> days<00:00:38.270> hmm

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
295 days hmm

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
295 days hmm
how<00:00:40.379> long<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> average<00:00:41.250> cycle<00:00:41.940> between

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
how long is the average cycle between

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.680 
how long is the average cycle between
consecutive<00:00:42.750> full<00:00:43.290> moons<00:00:44.149> 29<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.660> half

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
consecutive full moons 29 and a half

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.910 
consecutive full moons 29 and a half
days<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> take<00:00:48.539> 29<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> half<00:00:49.410> days

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
days so take 29 and a half days

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.090 
days so take 29 and a half days
multiplied<00:00:50.760> by<00:00:51.210> 10<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.329> 295<00:00:54.329> days<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
multiplied by 10 you get 295 days so if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
multiplied by 10 you get 295 days so if
your<00:00:56.610> child<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:57.210> born<00:00:57.480> under<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> full<00:00:58.469> moon

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
your child was born under a full moon

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.979 
your child was born under a full moon
that<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.520> simply<00:00:59.850> meant<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.510> got<00:01:00.690> knocked

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that just simply meant you got knocked

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
that just simply meant you got knocked
up<00:01:01.199> under<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> full<00:01:01.829> moon<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
up under a full moon that's what that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.830 
up under a full moon that's what that
meant<00:01:03.000> okay<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> no<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.430> argues<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
meant okay and no one argues the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.340 
meant okay and no one argues the
romantic<00:01:07.350> effects<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.250> moonlit<00:01:08.640> night

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
romantic effects of a moonlit night

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
romantic effects of a moonlit night
okay<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.430> behavior<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.150> told<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
okay what about behavior I told you this

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
okay what about behavior I told you this
was<00:01:12.840> brain<00:01:13.049> droppings<00:01:13.560> I've<00:01:13.680> warned<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> in

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
was brain droppings I've warned you in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
was brain droppings I've warned you in
advance<00:01:16.189> behavior<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> full<00:01:17.640> moons<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.479> one

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
advance behavior and full moons this one

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
advance behavior and full moons this one
is<00:01:18.810> classic<00:01:19.290> people<00:01:19.560> say<00:01:19.680> oh<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.920> acted

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
is classic people say oh they acted

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
is classic people say oh they acted
crazy<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.850> must<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.600> moon<00:01:21.840> pulls<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> tides

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
crazy and must the moon pulls the tides

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.120 
crazy and must the moon pulls the tides
the<00:01:23.670> tides<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:24.270> made<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.720> water<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.740> human

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the tides are made of water the human

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.370 
the tides are made of water the human
body<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.610> mostly<00:01:27.030> water<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.900> moon<00:01:28.110> must

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
body is mostly water the moon must

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160 
body is mostly water the moon must
affect<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> human<00:01:29.070> body<00:01:29.600> until<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.750> actually

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
affect the human body until you actually

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.219 
affect the human body until you actually
do<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> math<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> math<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
do the math and when you do the math you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
do the math and when you do the math you
could<00:01:34.409> ask<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.829> question<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> tidal

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
could ask the question what is the tidal

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.770 
could ask the question what is the tidal
force<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:38.070> moon<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.850> cranium<00:01:39.450> how

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
force of the moon on your cranium how

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
force of the moon on your cranium how
about<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> calculation<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> could<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
about that calculation you could do that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.510 
about that calculation you could do that
calculation<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.780> tidal<00:01:43.200> force<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.310> moon

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
calculation the tidal force of the moon

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.969 
calculation the tidal force of the moon
on<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:45.090> cranium<00:01:45.630> because<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.799> were

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
on your cranium because if that were

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
on your cranium because if that were
severe<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.060> could<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:48.899> be

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
severe that could be that could be

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.819 
severe that could be that could be
messing<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
messing with you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.030 
messing with you
right<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
right all right so you do the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.249 
right all right so you do the
calculation<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> turns<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.140> one

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
calculation it turns out if you're one

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.929 
calculation it turns out if you're one
of<00:01:55.350> these<00:01:55.439> people<00:01:55.649> who<00:01:55.950> sleep<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
of these people who sleep with like a

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.910 
of these people who sleep with like a
lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.270> pillows<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> pillow<00:01:58.680> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
lot of pillows and one of the pillow is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.459 
lot of pillows and one of the pillow is
kind<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.280> leaning<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.729> your<00:01:59.850> head<00:02:00.030> overnight

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
kind of leaning on your head overnight

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.190 
kind of leaning on your head overnight
the<00:02:01.469> pressure<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:02.850> pillow<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.570> your

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the pressure from that pillow on your

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.100 
the pressure from that pillow on your
head<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:06.600> trillion<00:02:07.409> times<00:02:07.680> greater<00:02:08.190> than

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
head is a trillion times greater than
