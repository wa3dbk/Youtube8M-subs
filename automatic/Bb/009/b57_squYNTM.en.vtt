00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.780
 it is faith and softness 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.849
 so I'm here on the track they did here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
 lose house and today will present a 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.890
 little of that shit and what they did then 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.350
 It would be there starting on facebook that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 it looks like the portal to hell and if you do not 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 knows Hell Gate binds there 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.580
 will a wall serve 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.309
 carla drops here he just dies 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.309
 and the goal has almost no serigne 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.899
 the serva kilos and come to launch of employment 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:56.800
 the girl neither worse nor a boy a beautiful 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.129
 of a turn and now we go to the country 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.559
 that interests us the street area and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.019
 this pizza made based on another 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.840
 the track that has here são paulo and the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.240
 I'll tell you what's in the neighborhood and nine more 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.729
 A great galley and this track that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.350
 we have a sea is to catch the project there and 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.240
 try to do here right? 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.649
 and from what we are seeing try the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.479
 even though he could not even get close to 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.920
 I think you are exaggerating 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.000
 people are going to make a comparison now 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 between the sumaré track and this track that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 huh 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.409
 and now look at the difference of spreading 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.200
 now look at you 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.640
 the only difference was the delta q 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.490
 put it here that was saved 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.979
 This one can now see the confrere here. 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.409
 I will add the ramp much more smoothly though 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.030
 very straight and not even look at this I 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.179
 I think in my private opinion 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.490
 My people think that this easy beast 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.069
 How very straight I met in my 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.969
 opinion who only my head not even 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.700
 the door 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:13.680
 although this creep ramp looks more like a 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 slider is good and here they have this clothes 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.129
 which is the same as the other 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.200
 or so I do not know for a 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:24.629
 ramp take care on the wall bug and here is the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.019
 mini cup of anhangabaú that the ball hit 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.560
 in the network for your self the difference here 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.560
 I will add 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.940
 here is good for you learned the lounge 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.940
 beck 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.750
 only not hotter than the race 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:03.580
 bad we will walk here is a must 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:05.830
 Right out of the house here in which the 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.890
 folks who are learning to learn 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.700
 a clue of this here later in any 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.010
 place says 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.900
 I think I'll even go local here 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.390
 I'm getting here 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:26.440
 the mandate is in the street league is up to 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:28.480
 Cuzco and now I'll show you the best 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.000
 place and this place is a place that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 have done so far and have no 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.230
 anything and oddly enough was 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.750
 best place to skate then 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.209
 check out the pictures now the best place 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.239
 of the floor place even if it does not slip 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.820
 against lightning or v that runs off with the 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:58.420
 your skin and ample room for the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:04:00.430
 You little bums have fun if you went 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.390
 the video is presented a little bit 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.570
 girl there and if you like the video is 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.329
 of course because the lane leaves the one with the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.760
 Walnut of that favorite shared 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.980
 capes, I'm going to stay in the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 covered space that the sun there is already 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:23.190
 released this is it and until the next video 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.190
 Now I'm going to train the process. 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.360
 attention to the compulsory use of the helmet 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.130
 and at least that good that gives pattern 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.930
 to sell only goes to the depths 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.930
 from hell if you fall 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.720
 it `s not perfect
