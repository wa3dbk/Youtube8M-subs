00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
design design wear this as a square

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.729 
design design wear this as a square
that's<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.000> unique<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.630> unique<00:00:30.020> design<00:00:30.380> why

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
that's a unique a unique design why

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.580 
that's a unique a unique design why
would<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:31.599> be<00:00:32.599> important<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.260> see<00:00:33.559> the

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
would it be important is to see the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.160 
would it be important is to see the
lighting<00:00:34.340> effect<00:00:34.760> just<00:00:35.210> behind<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.839> lamps

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
lighting effect just behind the lamps

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.439 
lighting effect just behind the lamps
that's<00:00:36.350> why<00:00:36.470> we<00:00:36.500> have<00:00:36.769> put<00:00:37.339> a<00:00:37.370> hole<00:00:37.670> in<00:00:37.910> verse

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
that's why we have put a hole in verse

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.509 
that's why we have put a hole in verse
in<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.720> middle<00:00:39.019> of<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.170> lamp<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:39.589> at<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
in the middle of the lamp and at a

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.049 
in the middle of the lamp and at a
unique<00:00:40.910> design<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.480> everybody<00:00:41.839> remembers<00:00:42.379> it

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
unique design so everybody remembers it

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.689 
unique design so everybody remembers it
somehow<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:44.120> works<00:00:44.379> we<00:00:45.379> can<00:00:45.559> see<00:00:45.769> you<00:00:45.920> have<00:00:46.160> 18

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
somehow it works we can see you have 18

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.960 
somehow it works we can see you have 18
LED<00:00:47.150> inside<00:00:47.510> 9<00:00:47.960> RG<00:00:48.290> b<00:00:48.589> 9<00:00:48.800> wide<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:49.760> can

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
LED inside 9 RG b 9 wide and we can

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.479 
LED inside 9 RG b 9 wide and we can
control<00:00:50.390> each<00:00:50.600> one<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:50.900> them<00:00:51.250> what<00:00:52.250> does<00:00:52.370> it

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
control each one of them what does it

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.000 
control each one of them what does it
mean<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.879> means<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.239> we<00:00:53.270> can<00:00:53.600> produce<00:00:54.320> many

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
mean it means that we can produce many

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.500 
mean it means that we can produce many
lighting<00:00:55.579> effects<00:00:56.300> from<00:00:57.109> static<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:57.680> dynamic

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
lighting effects from static to dynamic

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.569 
lighting effects from static to dynamic
as<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.690> say<00:00:59.840> dynamic<00:01:00.289> that's<00:01:00.620> multicolor<00:01:01.280> and

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
as I say dynamic that's multicolor and

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.090 
as I say dynamic that's multicolor and
just<00:01:02.329> recall<00:01:02.840> is<00:01:02.960> changing<00:01:03.289> over<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.559> time<00:01:03.800> so

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
just recall is changing over the time so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.560 
just recall is changing over the time so
that's<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.339> great<00:01:04.519> thing<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.000> here<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.449> a
