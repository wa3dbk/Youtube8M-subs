here it has buttons and I actually like

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
here it has buttons and I actually like
this<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> lot<00:00:28.320> better<00:00:28.710> than<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> palm<00:00:29.099> pre<00:00:29.279> plus

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
this a lot better than the palm pre plus

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.089 
this a lot better than the palm pre plus
because<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> pan<00:00:31.320> up<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
because not just the pan up like the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
because not just the pan up like the
palm<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.669> more<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> phone

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
palm is more of like it's just a phone

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.090 
palm is more of like it's just a phone
and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.590> nothing<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and then there's like nothing on the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860 
and then there's like nothing on the
front<00:00:35.309> except<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> screen<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.690> some

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
front except for the screen I like some

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
front except for the screen I like some
buttons<00:00:37.200> there<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.800> looks<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.100> plain<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
buttons there just looks too plain and I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.880 
buttons there just looks too plain and I
just<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.719> other<00:00:40.350> than<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

instead<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.460> having<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> plain<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
instead of having a just a plain like I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
instead of having a just a plain like I
think<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.880> palm<00:01:51.090> might<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.390> touch-sensitive

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
think the palm might be touch-sensitive

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
here definitely like that because

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.190 
here definitely like that because
actually<00:01:55.890> adds<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> look<00:01:56.960> now<00:01:57.960> I'll<00:01:58.140> show
