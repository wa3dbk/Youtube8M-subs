make a pick we're trying to create a
little<00:04:13.269> bit<00:04:13.360> of<00:04:13.480> mystery<00:04:14.409> a<00:04:14.500> little<00:04:14.709> bit<00:04:14.829> of

little bit of mystery a little bit of

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.949 
little bit of mystery a little bit of
anticipation<00:04:15.489> into<00:04:15.970> these<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.780> could<00:04:16.900> be

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
anticipation into these so it could be

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:25.940 
anticipation into these so it could be
anywhere<00:04:17.260> from<00:04:17.320> 1<00:04:17.680> through<00:04:17.919> 2<00:04:18.010> 4<00:04:18.220> spaces

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.430 

I<00:04:26.040> think<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.880> doesn't<00:04:27.210> say<00:04:27.420> what<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.290> would

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
I think it doesn't say what you would

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.670 
I think it doesn't say what you would
get<00:04:28.560> for<00:04:28.860> ferus<00:04:29.520> ferus<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:31.170> actually<00:04:31.470> go<00:04:31.620> to

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
get for ferus ferus you actually go to

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.560 
get for ferus ferus you actually go to
an<00:04:31.890> additional<00:04:32.040> pic<00:04:32.430> screen<00:04:32.760> which<00:04:33.090> opens<00:04:33.480> up

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
an additional pic screen which opens up

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.970 
an additional pic screen which opens up

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
a multitude of different values which

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.850 
a multitude of different values which
can<00:04:35.100> be<00:04:35.190> awarded<00:04:35.550> to<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.760> player<00:04:36.620> this<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.830> a
