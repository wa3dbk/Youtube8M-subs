00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.190 
to be taking this issue very seriously
and<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.820> mean<00:03:33.030> there's<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.630> lot<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.900> examples

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
and I mean there's a lot of examples

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.690 
and I mean there's a lot of examples
here<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.530> Qatar<00:03:34.739> especially<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.550> oil

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
here in Qatar especially with the oil

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.729 
here in Qatar especially with the oil
and<00:03:35.880> gas<00:03:36.000> industry<00:03:36.630> where<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.170> standards<00:03:37.620> are

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and gas industry where the standards are

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.500 
and gas industry where the standards are
extremely<00:03:38.160> high<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.489> we<00:03:38.910> are<00:03:39.000> looking<00:03:39.150> to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
extremely high and we are looking to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.860 
extremely high and we are looking to
have<00:03:40.410> standards<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:40.860> are<00:03:41.040> similar<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.489> those

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
have standards that are similar to those

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.660 
have standards that are similar to those
if<00:03:42.870> you've<00:03:43.110> been<00:03:43.230> looking<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.620> for<00:03:43.920> three

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
if you've been looking at this for three

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.330 
if you've been looking at this for three
years<00:03:44.700> plus<00:03:45.239> now<00:03:45.510> with<00:03:45.840> FIFA<00:03:46.410> how<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.310> that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
years plus now with FIFA how is it that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.070 
years plus now with FIFA how is it that
so<00:03:47.670> many<00:03:47.700> workers<00:03:48.090> are<00:03:48.390> still<00:03:48.600> dying<00:03:48.870> on

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
so many workers are still dying on

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
results with us well we're not the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.740 
results with us well we're not the
holders<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.270> these<00:04:52.640> of<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.850> study<00:04:54.150> or<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.510> this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.570 
holders of these of the study or of this
investigation<00:04:55.230> so<00:04:55.680> again<00:04:55.980> this<00:04:56.160> question<00:04:56.490> I

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
investigation so again this question I

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.920 
investigation so again this question I
think<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.880> better<00:04:57.030> close<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.540> Ministry<00:04:57.870> of

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
think is better close to the Ministry of

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.810 
think is better close to the Ministry of
Labor<00:04:58.170> hearings<00:04:58.500> but<00:04:58.650> if<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.130> came<00:04:59.370> back<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.730> you

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
is already happening what do you think

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.120 
is already happening what do you think
about<00:05:46.230> your<00:05:46.380> country<00:05:46.740> when<00:05:46.890> you<00:05:46.980> hear

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
about your country when you hear

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.960 
about your country when you hear
somebody<00:05:47.370> saying<00:05:47.700> that<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:49.730> think<00:05:50.730> that

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
somebody saying that I think that

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.820 
somebody saying that I think that
there's<00:05:51.210> always<00:05:51.450> areas<00:05:51.780> for<00:05:52.110> improvement<00:05:52.200> but

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
there's always areas for improvement but

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.450 
there's always areas for improvement but
I<00:05:52.860> think<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.250> there's<00:05:53.430> also<00:05:53.669> very<00:05:54.030> very<00:05:54.510> good

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
I think that there's also very very good

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.890 
I think that there's also very very good
examples<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:56.610> are<00:05:56.760> existing<00:05:57.030> right<00:05:57.450> now<00:05:57.480> of

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
examples that are existing right now of

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.300 
examples that are existing right now of
exemplary<00:05:59.720> workers<00:06:00.720> sites<00:06:01.080> workers<00:06:02.040> living

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
exemplary workers sites workers living

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.760 
exemplary workers sites workers living
quarters<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.480> I<00:06:03.840> think<00:06:04.110> that<00:06:04.350> if<00:06:04.560> you're

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
quarters and I think that if you're

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.650 
quarters and I think that if you're
gonna<00:06:04.890> take<00:06:05.370> take<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.090> negative<00:06:06.480> and<00:06:06.570> just

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
gonna take take the negative and just

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.840 
gonna take take the negative and just
focus<00:06:07.140> on<00:06:07.260> that<00:06:07.320> then<00:06:08.160> you<00:06:08.310> can<00:06:08.460> always<00:06:08.580> paint

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
focus on that then you can always paint

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.300 
focus on that then you can always paint
a<00:06:09.000> picture<00:06:09.620> looking<00:06:10.620> at<00:06:10.770> it<00:06:10.860> like<00:06:10.980> that<00:06:11.100> but<00:06:11.220> I

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
a picture looking at it like that but I

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.260 
a picture looking at it like that but I
also<00:06:11.490> think<00:06:11.730> that<00:06:11.880> they're<00:06:12.000> very<00:06:12.150> good

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
also think that they're very good

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.940 
also think that they're very good
