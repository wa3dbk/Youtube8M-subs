00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 At this time we get in touch with 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 our correspondent from mexico 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.730
 García who offers us information 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.440
 updated about what happens in the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 Huimanguillo municipality where 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
 derailed this train leaving so far 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 a balance of 5 dead and 35 injured 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.660
 ariza that you can tell us is about 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.660
 that the figure could increase 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.609
 exactly sofía the figures could 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.910
 increase because on this train they were traveling 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.039
 500 undocumented, that's why it's said 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.029
 officially that there are 5 dead but in 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.280
 reality 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.100
 unofficially speaking of a number 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.710
 undetermined of deaths in the first 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.650
 hours this morning there was talk of 50 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.690
 killed and 250 injured then the government 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.940
 rectified the figure and said there are five 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.760
 the dead but the experts with the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 that we have contacted the staff that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.010
 is working on the rescue in this 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.689
 air and nautical bridge tell us that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.449
 the death toll then is 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.220
 indeterminate because in addition 16 of the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.189
 injured are in a state of 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.790
 gravity but that's what you like well 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.130
 There are 5 official reports were saying that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.860
 speaks of more than 200 injured 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.290
 this is a very strong derailment 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.720
 the one that has happened this this event and 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.310
 of course it's the train called the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.619
 beast candle 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 just when I was going through Tabasco this 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.030
 train 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.760
 he is told he knows him by many names 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.310
 and how well this story described 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.820
 of the documentary is the train that moves 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.880
 the migrants from towards the north of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.810
 mexico when they seek to travel towards 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.720
 USA 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.270
 it is important to remember that this is 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.310
 a freight train and it goes through everything 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.229
 the Mexican territory from the border 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.509
 with guatemala to the limits with 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.149
 united states and of course those who 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.649
 they use what the migrant uses 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.679
 mainly Central Americans in this 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.229
 case the train was carrying Hondurans them 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:02.110
 they travel on the spine or the part above 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.500
 of the train not even because it's a train 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.659
 of merchandise therefore are at expense 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 at the mercy of everything that happens there is 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.440
 know sofía that the migrants and that what 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 we have said in all the stories 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.209
 our telesur because the engine has 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.920
 had a permanent presence throughout 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.540
 this journey of the beast we have done 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.519
 several reports several stories 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 because it is terrible what happens in the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.630
 migrants they are victims of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.760
 accidents like this case are victims 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.810
 of extortion by part of even the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.090
 Mexican authorities 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.770
 to Sofia from assaults of violations and 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.680
 kidnappings by bands linked to 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 drug trafficking hundreds of migrants 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.040
 Central American and South American 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.520
 your future in this freight train 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.410
 but unfortunately they are victims of 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.569
 everything and target of all these things that 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.959
 this mentioned and good today happened this 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.170
 unfortunate accident here in the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.450
 municipality of huimanguillo this is like 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.670
 you said between the states of Tabasco and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.800
 veracruz a team not this until soon 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.480
 and get to the area later on they 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.350
 we will be reporting all of these 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.640
 incidents 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.290
 there is just what you 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.350
 you mentioned with the condition of the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.080
 migrants without documents what could 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.819
 spend with them once the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.799
 people who are injured recover 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.720
 or even those that did not come out or 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.900
 they came out unharmed from this accident 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.300
 that's a good question first that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.630
 everyone is being treated right now 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.710
 in a hospital that is more chiapas in the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.540
 Veracruz state 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.390
 after this the cars 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.459
 Hondurans should try to move 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.189
 these people are surely going to be 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.560
 deported to their countries but the question 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.260
 is very important in Sofia in both 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.390
 remember what happened to the 72 migrants 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.450
 that were massacred that were 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.090
 found three years ago precisely in 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.829
 San Fernando Tamaulipas, because many do not 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.750
 have not even been the bodies 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.409
 recovered the authorities has not 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.659
 showed great interest in these bodies 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.489
 there are many that are unidentified 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.340
 still that is the tragedy of the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.290
 migrants is tremendous even in cases 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.030
 terrible as this one of the massacre that 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.180
 can happen now in the best of the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.310
 cases is that once these people 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.599
 those who manage to overcome are reestablished 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.949
 this and come alive with this blue one 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.160
 once they are treated in hospitals 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.650
 in peak or world 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.690
 will be imported to their countries 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.550
 never succeed in reaching at least 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.500
 the moment to us that is the dream of 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.630
 these the Central American Mexicans and 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.400
 these migrants who flee from issues 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.200
 have to improve their situation 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.050
 economic and seek the so-called dream 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.480
 american this game with the tour of 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.790
 this train can you tell us a little more 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.070
 to send us the panorama of this 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.320
 Recognized train as we saw it 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.449
 also in the story that we passed 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.139
 previously about this documentary 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.240
 look at the train travels all south mexico 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.870
 to the north because in the north is 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.370
 today because of the south because it comes from 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.999
 the border with guatemala 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.559
 almost all migrants 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.710
 Central Americans arrive to Guatemala 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:13.770
 and from there they make the journey to the back of 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.389
 this train to reach the USA or the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.990
 part of the border of mexico with 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.819
 united states- new try to cross 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.339
 through the desert in conditions 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.819
 inhospitable in subhuman conditions 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:29.069
 I would say and also then try to cross 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.439
 by the brave river we have several 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.960
 stories about how they die day 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.210
 day migrants trying to cross 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.139
 by the brave river and I want to tell you something 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.419
 more are not Mexican migrants though 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.339
 there are still some but it is getting smaller 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.089
 is to prohibit Mexicans before it does that 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.399
 way the vast majority are almost 90% 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:53.460
 Central American migrants on the road 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:56.490
 they make stops in some shelters 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.330
 who have built organizations not 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.419
 governmental and some religious 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.259
 some people in good faith and even 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.439
 university students have given the task of 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:09.719
 health the titans centers and here I do not have 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.699
 this journey I remember once 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.129
 we did the tour in the 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.229
 beast and it was quite difficult we did it 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.360
 just when there was a caravan of 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.249
 migrant mothers who was heading towards the 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.439
 north a little to show this reality 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.060
 that the Mexican media means 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:25.950
 in central America 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.590
 telesur or monster we did 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.870
 several stories and a story 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.000
 just what happened and we were a 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.190
 I travel quite difficult enough 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.050
 dangerous even our camera up 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.660
 see me everything can happen in this 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.030
 tour of the beast that as I said 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.400
 resorts from south to north all 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.990
 Mexican territory is sofía very many 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.300
 thanks there we will be pending 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.910
 just for what he said he has 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.400
 said that in the area where this happened 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.200
 derailment is difficult to access 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.300
 which has also made it more complicated 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.560
 the rescue of the victims of this 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.860
 accident 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.860
 let's
