hard<00:02:06.159> surface<00:02:06.729> stuff<00:02:06.999> so<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:09.069> has<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> range<00:02:09.520> of

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
hard surface stuff so it has a range of

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.339 
hard surface stuff so it has a range of
around<00:02:10.000> 25<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.810> 30<00:02:11.200> meters<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:14.080> order<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
around 25 to 30 meters and in order to

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.680 
around 25 to 30 meters and in order to
get<00:02:14.500> attack<00:02:14.830> assist<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.520> will<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.240> let

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
get attack assist you will have to let

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.470 
get attack assist you will have to let
your<00:02:16.930> teammates<00:02:17.440> kill<00:02:18.370> someone<00:02:18.910> within<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
your teammates kill someone within the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.250 
your teammates kill someone within the
range<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.349> motion<00:02:21.069> sensor<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:22.260> really

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
range of the motion sensor so I really

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.690 
range of the motion sensor so I really
really<00:02:24.189> recommend<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.849> to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
really recommend you to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.580 
really recommend you to
and<00:02:26.739> always<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:28.280> put<00:02:28.550> down<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.390> tax<00:02:30.349> if

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and always just put down the tax if

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.759 
and always just put down the tax if
you're<00:02:30.769> capturing<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.340> flag<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:32.590> most<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
you're capturing a flag and most of the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.600 
you're capturing a flag and most of the
time<00:02:33.980> there<00:02:34.190> will<00:02:34.489> be<00:02:34.519> people<00:02:34.970> trying<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:36.610> keep

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
time there will be people trying to keep

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.729 
time there will be people trying to keep
you<00:02:37.760> off<00:02:37.879> their<00:02:38.090> flag<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:39.349> will<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.620> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
this I would recommend you going in a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.150 
this I would recommend you going in a
team<00:02:53.480> deathmatch<00:02:53.720> server<00:02:53.930> or<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.260> operation

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
team deathmatch server or in a operation

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.720 
team deathmatch server or in a operation
metro<00:02:58.640> conquest<00:02:59.540> large<00:02:59.599> server<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.560> then<00:03:01.400> on

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
metro conquest large server and then on

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.759 
metro conquest large server and then on
meteor<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.630> put<00:03:02.840> down<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.290> motion

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
meteor you have to put down the motion

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.360 
meteor you have to put down the motion
sensor<00:03:04.160> on<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.849> B<00:03:05.030> flag<00:03:05.299> where<00:03:06.040> we<00:03:07.040> always

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
sensor on the B flag where we always

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.509 
sensor on the B flag where we always
have<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.700> big<00:03:08.060> mass<00:03:08.329> so<00:03:08.840> I'd<00:03:09.650> recommend<00:03:09.829> 64

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
have the big mass so I'd recommend 64

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.940 
have the big mass so I'd recommend 64
players<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.120> team<00:03:11.870> deathmatch<00:03:12.079> for<00:03:12.560> example

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
players and team deathmatch for example

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.800 
players and team deathmatch for example
norcia<00:03:13.250> canals<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.209> have<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.510> put<00:03:14.690> down

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
norcia canals and you have to put down

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.780 
norcia canals and you have to put down
your<00:03:14.989> motion<00:03:15.290> sensor<00:03:15.519> somewhere<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.670> between

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
your motion sensor somewhere in between

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.089 
your motion sensor somewhere in between
those<00:03:17.410> big<00:03:18.410> tanks<00:03:19.160> or<00:03:19.280> canisters<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:21.290> they

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
those big tanks or canisters and they

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.460 
those big tanks or canisters and they
will<00:03:22.370> easily<00:03:22.640> get<00:03:22.970> those<00:03:23.239> 20<00:03:23.630> tax<00:03:24.019> assists

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
will easily get those 20 tax assists

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.979 
will easily get those 20 tax assists
just<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.730> let<00:03:26.060> your<00:03:26.239> teammates<00:03:26.720> finish

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
just have to let your teammates finish

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.180 
just have to let your teammates finish
off<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.319> guys<00:03:27.950> within<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.940> range<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:30.290> it's

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
off the guys within the range and it's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.410 
off the guys within the range and it's
basically<00:03:31.519> how<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.450> should<00:03:32.690> get<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:34.389> how<00:03:35.389> you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
basically how you should get the how you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.620 
basically how you should get the how you
should<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:35.900> able<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.260> get<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.530> em<00:03:36.799> 417<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.329> now

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
should be able to get the em 417 so now

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.910 
should be able to get the em 417 so now
let's<00:03:38.959> check<00:03:39.579> some<00:03:40.579> things<00:03:40.940> about<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.989> m4<00:03:42.590> 17

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
let's check some things about the m4 17

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520 
let's check some things about the m4 17
so<00:03:43.130> I've<00:03:43.280> used<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.819> for<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> while<00:03:44.930> now<00:03:45.290> right

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
so I've used it for a while now right

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.509 
so I've used it for a while now right
here<00:03:46.100> I'm<00:03:46.280> using<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.670> red<00:03:46.850> outside<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.600> laser

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
here I'm using the red outside the laser

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.390 
here I'm using the red outside the laser
pointer<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.730> also<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.420> foregrip<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
pointer and also the foregrip and the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.270 
pointer and also the foregrip and the
m47<00:03:53.090> teen<00:03:53.359> is<00:03:53.600> definitely<00:03:54.139> definitely<00:03:54.739> not

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
m47 teen is definitely definitely not

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.120 
m47 teen is definitely definitely not
like<00:03:55.519> a<00:03:55.790> enormous<00:03:56.150> knife<00:03:56.480> a<00:03:56.600> rifle<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.130> but

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
like a enormous knife a rifle and but

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.569 
like a enormous knife a rifle and but
it's<00:03:58.280> also<00:03:58.549> not<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:59.209> second<00:03:59.930> SKS<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.310> if<00:04:01.459> you

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
it's also not a second SKS and so if you

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.479 
it's also not a second SKS and so if you
already<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:02.000> unlocked<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.420> m39<00:04:03.109> EMR<00:04:03.769> or<00:04:04.010> the

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
already have unlocked the m39 EMR or the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.599 
already have unlocked the m39 EMR or the
qbu-88<00:04:05.269> you<00:04:05.780> will<00:04:05.930> feel<00:04:06.319> very<00:04:06.950> familiar<00:04:07.130> with

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
qbu-88 you will feel very familiar with

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.720 
qbu-88 you will feel very familiar with
this<00:04:08.090> rifle<00:04:08.389> and<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:09.709> found<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.250> be<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> little

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
this rifle and I found to be a little

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.500 
this rifle and I found to be a little
bit<00:04:10.849> more<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.630> m39<00:04:12.590> EMR<00:04:13.430> even<00:04:14.180> if<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.359> have

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
bit more like the m39 EMR even if I have

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.890 
bit more like the m39 EMR even if I have
unlocked<00:04:14.870> this<00:04:15.079> one<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:15.620> often<00:04:16.510> I'm<00:04:17.510> kinda

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
unlocked this one but I often I'm kinda

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.949 
unlocked this one but I often I'm kinda
used<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.380> from<00:04:18.530> dead<00:04:19.099> soldiers<00:04:19.729> so

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.170 

you<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.680> compare<00:04:23.009> can't<00:04:23.310> these<00:04:23.639> two<00:04:23.789> rifles

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
you can compare can't these two rifles

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.710 
you can compare can't these two rifles
and<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.680> can't<00:04:25.919> compare<00:04:26.340> very<00:04:27.270> good<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.630> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and you can't compare very good to the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.820 
and you can't compare very good to the
SKS<00:04:28.289> because<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:30.030> mean<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.750> can<00:04:30.990> spam<00:04:31.410> it

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
SKS because I mean you can spam it

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.670 
SKS because I mean you can spam it
semi-auto<00:04:32.819> and<00:04:32.940> close<00:04:33.360> quarters<00:04:33.780> which<00:04:34.500> you

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
semi-auto and close quarters which you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.350 
semi-auto and close quarters which you
always<00:04:34.949> should<00:04:35.130> because<00:04:35.520> aiming<00:04:36.210> down<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
always should because aiming down the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.770 
always should because aiming down the
sides<00:04:36.770> when<00:04:37.770> being<00:04:38.009> really<00:04:38.490> close<00:04:38.699> it's<00:04:39.479> just

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
sides when being really close it's just

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.189 
sides when being really close it's just
a<00:04:39.870> bad<00:04:40.020> idea<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:41.389> cause<00:04:42.389> it<00:04:42.539> won't<00:04:42.750> benefit

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
a bad idea and cause it won't benefit

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.330 
a bad idea and cause it won't benefit
you<00:04:43.259> in<00:04:43.560> any<00:04:43.740> way<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.819> you<00:04:44.940> just<00:04:45.300> have<00:04:45.569> to<00:04:46.340> spend

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
you in any way so you just have to spend

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.909 
you in any way so you just have to spend
semi-auto<00:04:47.849> and<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.360> works<00:04:48.630> pretty<00:04:48.900> good<00:04:49.470> but

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
semi-auto and that works pretty good but

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.779 
semi-auto and that works pretty good but
you<00:04:50.729> still<00:04:50.759> will<00:04:51.389> lose<00:04:51.750> any<00:04:52.169> gun<00:04:52.410> fight

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
you still will lose any gun fight

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.770 
you still will lose any gun fight
against<00:04:53.789> some<00:04:54.360> with<00:04:54.539> a<00:04:54.720> g18<00:04:55.710> or<00:04:56.039> a<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.490> K<00:04:56.970> or<00:04:57.000> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
against some with a g18 or a a K or a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.810 
against some with a g18 or a a K or a
finesse<00:04:58.349> so<00:04:59.840> you<00:05:00.840> can<00:05:01.050> do<00:05:01.979> pretty<00:05:02.340> okay<00:05:02.759> in

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
finesse so you can do pretty okay in

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.089 
finesse so you can do pretty okay in
close<00:05:03.000> quarters<00:05:03.389> but<00:05:03.660> is<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.530> really<00:05:04.889> a

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
close quarters but is it is really a

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.990 
close quarters but is it is really a
medium-range<00:05:05.669> gun<00:05:06.000> so<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:07.080> that's<00:05:07.860> where<00:05:08.099> it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
medium-range gun so and that's where it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.939 
medium-range gun so and that's where it
can<00:05:09.240> show<00:05:09.509> his<00:05:09.780> strong<00:05:10.639> sides<00:05:11.639> and<00:05:11.940> parts<00:05:12.270> and

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
can show his strong sides and parts and

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.510 
can show his strong sides and parts and
I<00:05:13.970> also<00:05:14.970> found<00:05:15.360> out<00:05:15.539> that<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.740> reddit<00:05:17.130> side<00:05:17.310> is

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
I also found out that the reddit side is

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.930 
I also found out that the reddit side is
really<00:05:17.970> useful<00:05:18.930> for<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:19.860> weapon<00:05:20.490> because

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
really useful for this weapon because

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.480 
really useful for this weapon because
you're<00:05:21.229> you<00:05:22.229> will<00:05:22.349> use<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:22.949> a<00:05:23.130> battle

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
you're you will use it like a battle

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.969 
you're you will use it like a battle
rifle<00:05:23.699> and<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:24.930> at<00:05:25.199> this<00:05:25.349> point<00:05:25.590> they're

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
rifle and so at this point they're

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.610 
rifle and so at this point they're
really<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:27.030> really<00:05:27.120> similar<00:05:27.539> to<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.110> SKS

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
really this really similar to the SKS

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.189 
really this really similar to the SKS
for<00:05:31.620> long<00:05:31.800> range<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.400> isn't<00:05:32.729> suited<00:05:33.509> as<00:05:33.690> well

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
for long range it isn't suited as well

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.600 
for long range it isn't suited as well
because<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.880> damage<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.389> has<00:05:36.449> a<00:05:36.900> dare<00:05:37.139> from

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
because of the damage it has a dare from

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.510 
because of the damage it has a dare from
maximum<00:05:38.610> 50<00:05:39.150> and<00:05:39.469> after<00:05:40.469> around<00:05:40.830> like<00:05:41.099> 50

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
maximum 50 and after around like 50

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.390 
maximum 50 and after around like 50
meters<00:05:41.639> or<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.270> will<00:05:42.389> drop<00:05:42.599> down<00:05:42.659> to<00:05:43.400> 37

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
meters or so it will drop down to 37

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.830 
meters or so it will drop down to 37
point<00:05:44.639> 5<00:05:44.729> so<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:46.560> will<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:48.570> will<00:05:48.599> need

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
point 5 so you will have you will need

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.640 
point 5 so you will have you will need
three<00:05:49.229> shots<00:05:49.820> if<00:05:50.820> in<00:05:51.300> long-range<00:05:51.599> and<00:05:52.110> two

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
three shots if in long-range and two

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.409 
three shots if in long-range and two
shots<00:05:52.919> up<00:05:53.099> close<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.180> hatchet

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
shots up close and the hatchet

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.850 
shots up close and the hatchet
multipliers<00:05:54.870> 2.0<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:56.659> 2<00:05:57.659> headshots<00:05:58.110> or<00:05:58.320> two

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
multipliers 2.0 so 2 headshots or two

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.189 
multipliers 2.0 so 2 headshots or two
one<00:05:59.219> headshot<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.789> one<00:06:00.030> body<00:06:00.210> shot<00:06:00.509> for<00:06:01.080> long

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
one headshot and one body shot for long

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.939 
one headshot and one body shot for long
range<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.680> one<00:06:02.580> hecha<00:06:02.849> are<00:06:03.180> close<00:06:03.770> this<00:06:04.770> is

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
range and one hecha are close this is

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.219 
range and one hecha are close this is
within<00:06:05.509> 15<00:06:06.509> meters<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.320> I<00:06:08.120> think<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:09.419> you

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
within 15 meters and I think and you

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.459 
within 15 meters and I think and you
will<00:06:10.349> also<00:06:10.530> get<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:10.889> upper<00:06:11.250> chest<00:06:11.580> hitbox<00:06:12.469> so

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
will also get the upper chest hitbox so

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.550 
will also get the upper chest hitbox so
if<00:06:13.860> you're<00:06:14.210> medium<00:06:15.210> range<00:06:15.539> you<00:06:15.750> might<00:06:15.990> get<00:06:16.229> two

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
if you're medium range you might get two

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.219 
if you're medium range you might get two
shot<00:06:16.830> hit<00:06:17.669> kills<00:06:18.229> to<00:06:19.229> the<00:06:19.320> upper<00:06:19.620> chest<00:06:20.150> so<00:06:21.229> to

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
shot hit kills to the upper chest so to

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.749 
shot hit kills to the upper chest so to
summarize<00:06:23.630> everything<00:06:24.630> I've<00:06:24.900> said<00:06:25.639> you<00:06:26.639> will
