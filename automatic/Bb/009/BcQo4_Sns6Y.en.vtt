 little information like the quest as 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.259

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 10% visible that you completely 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.560
 bad looks but so stop there 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.970
 Cargo boxes will be in kandy style there 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:56.909
 So that's what they call it 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:00.479
 sugar bars on it is that in the picture 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.520
 new formation which is quite informative 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.440
 so interesting 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.000
 even only at certain times 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.700
 be available as well as the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.640
 ammunition the formations will be eight 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 percent more damage to mpc talker 8 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.180
 percent more experience 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.720
 as far as I know , but makes you 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.930
 it ships 50 slower okay well my 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.870
 yes would be a new ammo 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.720
 The halloween ammo is too 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.340
 only available at certain times 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.110
 and there and yes that's new big 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.550
 halloween npcs you already have in the sample 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.190
 taken in front by accell and 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.830
 I also have a big background here 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.300
 is this quality times with this 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:59.459
 small million fishermen think about it 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:04.550
 170 times behave like this 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:07.709
 this turned the perpetrators 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.459
 I guess to be cheap by anger 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.230
 flying over the cards and the cards 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.870
 make uncertain 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.760
 So yes, of course, to level otherwise go 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.070
 with ball and I have to think so 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.570
 nothing to tell 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:27.860
 the facebook knows that as well 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.860
 interesting actually you have to say 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:39.440
 which made me personally fascinating 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.120
 band it is now supposed to give new pc 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.470
 So the new formation comes out okay 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.030
 that is secondary to my opinion 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:54.530
 after that this npc i find bad 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:59.280
 so it really is really good and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:07.320
 am also of the opinion that yes that is pleased 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:10.440
 itself that one comes in the pc correctly 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.209
 only halloween even looks good 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.660
 is not bad 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.660
 yes I hope you have the 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.440
 I would have liked it again 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.180
 next time again 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.780
 that is the group of mtv and there we 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 Until next time
