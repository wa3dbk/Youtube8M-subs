streak<00:00:57.449> set<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.140> game<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> UAB

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
streak set up for this game is the UAB

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
streak set up for this game is the UAB
the<00:00:59.789> Harrier<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> pave<00:01:00.780> low<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the Harrier and the pave low and that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.009 
the Harrier and the pave low and that
might<00:01:01.859> sound<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.190> odd<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> UAV<00:01:03.719> i

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
might sound a bit odd me using the UAV i

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
might sound a bit odd me using the UAV i
believe<00:01:04.799> i've<00:01:04.979> only<00:01:05.159> ever<00:01:05.280> used<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> UAV<00:01:06.030> in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
believe i've only ever used the UAV in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
believe i've only ever used the UAV in
one<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.900> video<00:01:07.320> ever<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.330> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
one other video ever and that was a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.630 
one other video ever and that was a
video<00:01:09.570> i<00:01:09.750> believe<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.560> second<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.100> third<00:01:11.130> video

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
video i believe my second or third video

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.300 
video i believe my second or third video
ever<00:01:11.880> uploaded<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> long-ass

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
ever uploaded and that was a long-ass

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
ever uploaded and that was a long-ass
time<00:01:14.729> ago<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> reason<00:01:15.930> why<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> never<00:01:16.200> use

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
time ago and the reason why I never use

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.910 
time ago and the reason why I never use
UAV<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.869> kill<00:01:19.229> streaks<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
UAV is because I like kill streaks that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.539 
UAV is because I like kill streaks that
give<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.310> direct<00:01:20.939> kills<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.549> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
give me direct kills I like to see the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
give me direct kills I like to see the
benefits<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> reap<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> benefits<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
benefits I like to reap the benefits of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
benefits I like to reap the benefits of
my<00:01:25.740> killstreaks<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.640> want<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> have

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
my killstreaks and I don't want to have

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
my killstreaks and I don't want to have
to<00:01:27.590> because<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.740> there's<00:01:28.920> always<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.340> chance

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to because like there's always a chance

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
to because like there's always a chance
that<00:01:29.790> even<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> UAV<00:01:30.810> you'll<00:01:31.200> die<00:01:31.530> but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that even with the UAV you'll die but

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
that even with the UAV you'll die but
more<00:01:32.640> often<00:01:32.820> than<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> UAV

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
more often than not if you have a UAV

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
more often than not if you have a UAV
that's<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> end<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.340> being<00:01:35.549> more

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's going to end up being more

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.749 
that's going to end up being more
beneficial<00:01:36.180> than<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.750> predator<00:01:37.229> missile

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
beneficial than a predator missile

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.890 
beneficial than a predator missile
sometimes<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.060> certain<00:01:39.360> airstrikes

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
sometimes you know certain airstrikes

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.569 
sometimes you know certain airstrikes
especially<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.560> they<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.770> shot<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
especially when they get shot down I

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.330 
especially when they get shot down I
actually<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.659> um<00:01:42.930> believe<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
actually see um believe it or not I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
actually see um believe it or not I
actually<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:45.119> things<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.630> Harriers<00:01:46.229> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
actually see things like Harriers and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.249 
actually see things like Harriers and
Palos<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.070> shot<00:01:47.280> down<00:01:47.490> more<00:01:48.180> than<00:01:48.240> UAVs<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
Palos get shot down more than UAVs and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
Palos get shot down more than UAVs and
that's<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:49.890> shocking<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.490> considering

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that's pretty shocking to me considering

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
that's pretty shocking to me considering
that<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> takes<00:01:51.450> less<00:01:52.290> than<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.770> clip<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that it takes less than one clip I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 
that it takes less than one clip I
believe<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.299> almost<00:01:54.810> any<00:01:55.049> gun<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.860> shoot<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
believe of almost any gun to shoot it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
believe of almost any gun to shoot it
down<00:01:56.340> um<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.840> shoot<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> down

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
down um I know you can shoot it down

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.859 
down um I know you can shoot it down
with<00:01:58.439> eight<00:01:58.649> FAMAS<00:01:59.189> first<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.790> UAV<00:02:00.210> or<00:02:00.390> counter

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.560 
with eight FAMAS first a UAV or counter
UAV<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.439> people<00:02:02.280> tend<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> only<00:02:03.090> care<00:02:03.360> about

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570

UAV but people tend to only care about
the<00:02:03.869> stuff<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.229> killing<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.090> people

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
the stuff that's killing them and people

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.609 
the stuff that's killing them and people
tend<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> only<00:02:06.570> use<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.200> stuff<00:02:07.439> that's

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
tend to only use the stuff that's

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.650 
tend to only use the stuff that's
getting<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:08.190> direct<00:02:08.700> kills<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.420> said

objective game time I guess I should

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.450 
objective game time I guess I should
just<00:03:16.320> call<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> team<00:03:16.830> deathmatch<00:03:17.040> when

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
just call it team deathmatch when

just call it team deathmatch when
playing<00:03:17.670> team<00:03:17.910> deathmatch<00:03:17.960> getting<00:03:18.960> kills<00:03:19.230> in

playing team deathmatch getting kills in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.700 
playing team deathmatch getting kills in
itself<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.250> being<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:21.000> team<00:03:21.180> player<00:03:21.380> now<00:03:22.380> I

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
itself is being a team player now I

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.190 
itself is being a team player now I
think<00:03:22.800> getting<00:03:23.190> kills<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.820> any<00:03:24.300> game<00:03:24.660> type<00:03:24.930> is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
think getting kills in any game type is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.320 
think getting kills in any game type is
being<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.500> team<00:03:25.680> player<00:03:25.910> does<00:03:26.910> not<00:03:27.090> matter

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
being a team player does not matter

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.000 
being a team player does not matter
whether<00:03:27.630> or<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.990> objective<00:03:28.590> has<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.740> do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
whether or not the objective has to do

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.950 
whether or not the objective has to do
with<00:03:29.130> kills<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.850> are<00:03:29.970> killing<00:03:30.300> people<00:03:30.330> it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.500 
prevents the enemy from being team
players<00:03:34.200> like<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.310> enemy<00:03:35.640> can't<00:03:35.880> do

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
players like that the enemy can't do

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.960 
players like that the enemy can't do
anything<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:36.900> their<00:03:37.020> team<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.410> they're<00:03:37.560> dead

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
anything for their team if they're dead

to see where they are

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.270 
to see where they are
well<00:04:13.050> then<00:04:13.230> oftentimes<00:04:13.770> they<00:04:14.010> will<00:04:14.100> actually

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
well then oftentimes they will actually

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.920 
well then oftentimes they will actually
be<00:04:14.520> actually<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.210> able<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> lot<00:04:15.780> better

be actually be able to do a lot better

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.900 
be actually be able to do a lot better
so<00:04:16.500> not<00:04:16.650> only<00:04:16.770> will<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.460> able<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.670> get<00:04:17.790> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so not only will you be able to get the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.000 
so not only will you be able to get the
kills<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.570> around<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.109> but<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.710> you<00:04:19.830> see

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010

a guy all the way across the map on your

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.350 
a guy all the way across the map on your
UAV<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:23.250> wouldn't<00:04:23.580> ever<00:04:23.729> be<00:04:23.850> able<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.210> let

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
UAV and you wouldn't ever be able to let

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.850 
UAV and you wouldn't ever be able to let
your<00:04:24.570> league

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
your league

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.379 
your league
not<00:04:25.039> gonna<00:04:25.250> run<00:04:25.580> over<00:04:25.610> there<00:04:25.939> just<00:04:26.210> without

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
not gonna run over there just without

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.029 
not gonna run over there just without
one<00:04:26.449> kill<00:04:26.870> you've<00:04:27.080> got<00:04:27.259> plenty<00:04:27.439> guys<00:04:27.740> around

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
one kill you've got plenty guys around

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.709 
one kill you've got plenty guys around
you<00:04:28.159> maybe<00:04:28.669> you've<00:04:28.879> got<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> teammate<00:04:29.449> all<00:04:29.629> the

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
you maybe you've got a teammate all the

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.089 
you maybe you've got a teammate all the
way<00:04:29.810> across<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.199> map<00:04:30.379> who<00:04:30.530> can<00:04:30.680> take<00:04:30.860> care<00:04:30.889> of

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
way across the map who can take care of

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.550 
way across the map who can take care of
that<00:04:31.280> guy<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.759> maybe<00:04:32.509> like<00:04:33.050> if<00:04:33.229> he<00:04:33.379> didn't

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
that guy and maybe like if he didn't

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.200 
that guy and maybe like if he didn't
have<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.710> UAV<00:04:34.159> he<00:04:34.340> would<00:04:34.490> have<00:04:34.580> died<00:04:34.819> or

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
have that UAV he would have died or

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.610 
have that UAV he would have died or
never<00:04:35.389> would<00:04:35.569> have<00:04:35.629> gotten<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:35.960> kill<00:04:36.229> so

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
never would have gotten that kill so

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.399 
never would have gotten that kill so
using<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.310> UAV<00:04:37.580> definitely<00:04:38.449> does<00:04:38.689> improve<00:04:39.199> your

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
using a UAV definitely does improve your

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.330 
using a UAV definitely does improve your
team<00:04:39.919> play<00:04:40.280> earnest<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.909> guess<00:04:42.039> through<00:04:43.039> one

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
team play earnest I guess through one

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.589 
team play earnest I guess through one
other<00:04:43.490> thing<00:04:43.669> we're<00:04:43.789> talking<00:04:43.909> about<00:04:44.030> in<00:04:44.389> this

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
other thing we're talking about in this

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.080 
other thing we're talking about in this
week<00:04:44.780> or<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.319> this<00:04:45.409> commentary<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.610> comment

week or in this commentary this comment

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.360 
week or in this commentary this comment
did<00:04:47.360> not<00:04:47.509> this<00:04:47.659> comedy<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.110> week<00:04:48.349> I<00:04:48.590> listened

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
did not this comedy this week I listened

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.309 
did not this comedy this week I listened
to<00:04:49.400> three<00:04:49.789> different<00:04:49.909> commentators<00:04:50.539> who<00:04:51.050> said

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
to three different commentators who said

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.600 
to three different commentators who said
pretty<00:04:51.530> much<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.860> exact<00:04:52.129> same<00:04:52.159> thing<00:04:52.490> in

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
pretty much the exact same thing in

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.070 
pretty much the exact same thing in
their<00:04:52.699> commentaries<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.360> gotta<00:04:53.539> hurry<00:04:53.689> this<00:04:53.900> up

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
their commentaries I gotta hurry this up

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.659 
their commentaries I gotta hurry this up
they<00:04:54.800> probably<00:04:54.979> all<00:04:55.219> listen<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.520> themselves

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
they probably all listen to themselves

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.550 
they probably all listen to themselves
and<00:04:56.270> they<00:04:56.389> just<00:04:56.569> repeated<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.139> but<00:04:57.349> I<00:04:57.379> heard

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
and they just repeated this but I heard

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.779 
and they just repeated this but I heard
three<00:04:57.800> different<00:04:58.069> commentators<00:04:58.520> say<00:04:58.639> that

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
three different commentators say that

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.969 
three different commentators say that
the<00:04:58.879> p90<00:04:59.419> does<00:04:59.659> not<00:04:59.840> benefit<00:05:00.349> much<00:05:00.949> from

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
the p90 does not benefit much from

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.749 
the p90 does not benefit much from
stopping<00:05:01.430> power<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:01.939> to<00:05:02.389> them<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.810> say<00:05:03.400> false<00:05:04.400> I

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
stopping power and to them I say false I

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.140 
stopping power and to them I say false I
say<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.830> p90<00:05:07.340> actually<00:05:07.610> benefits<00:05:08.060> from

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
say that the p90 actually benefits from

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.879 
say that the p90 actually benefits from
stopping<00:05:08.419> power<00:05:08.659> more<00:05:08.990> their<00:05:09.319> argument<00:05:09.770> was

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
stopping power more their argument was

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.230 
stopping power more their argument was
that<00:05:09.919> because<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.430> has<00:05:10.520> such<00:05:10.699> a<00:05:10.729> large<00:05:10.939> clip

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
that because it has such a large clip

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.330 
that because it has such a large clip
size<00:05:11.449> that<00:05:12.080> you<00:05:12.169> don't<00:05:12.409> need<00:05:12.680> stopping<00:05:13.189> power

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
size that you don't need stopping power

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.550 
size that you don't need stopping power
you<00:05:13.520> don't<00:05:13.610> need<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.939> extra<00:05:14.090> damage<00:05:14.560> which

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
you don't need that extra damage which

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.740 
you don't need that extra damage which
you<00:05:15.770> know<00:05:15.889> in<00:05:16.669> theory<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.210> sounds<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:17.539> a<00:05:17.599> good

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
you know in theory it sounds like a good

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.619 
you know in theory it sounds like a good
idea<00:05:17.779> it<00:05:18.110> sounds<00:05:18.349> like<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.620> logical<00:05:19.069> point<00:05:20.029> but

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
idea it sounds like a logical point but

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.499 
idea it sounds like a logical point but
actually<00:05:21.110> when<00:05:21.379> using<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:22.520> p90<00:05:23.029> you<00:05:23.240> want

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
actually when using the p90 you want

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:24.969 
actually when using the p90 you want
that<00:05:23.689> extra<00:05:23.840> damage<00:05:24.199> because<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:24.949> a

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
that extra damage because it is a

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.309 
that extra damage because it is a
percentage<00:05:25.490> boost<00:05:25.789> and<00:05:26.090> since<00:05:26.629> the<00:05:26.719> p90<00:05:27.199> has

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
percentage boost and since the p90 has

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.839 
percentage boost and since the p90 has
much<00:05:27.529> more<00:05:27.680> bullets<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.159> have<00:05:28.310> much<00:05:28.610> more

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
much more bullets you have much more

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.879 
much more bullets you have much more
potential<00:05:29.270> damage<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:29.900> a<00:05:29.960> p90<00:05:30.469> with<00:05:30.589> stopping

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
potential damage in a p90 with stopping

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.209 
potential damage in a p90 with stopping
power<00:05:31.039> than<00:05:31.669> something<00:05:31.969> like<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.569> mini<00:05:33.560> Uzi<00:05:33.800> all

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
power than something like a mini Uzi all

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.129 
power than something like a mini Uzi all
right<00:05:34.339> so<00:05:35.060> that's<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.419> commentary<00:05:35.779> for<00:05:35.900> today

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
right so that's the commentary for today

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:37.510 
right so that's the commentary for today
guys<00:05:36.319> see<00:05:36.770> you<00:05:36.830> guys<00:05:36.949> later<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.279> hope<00:05:37.400> you

guys see you guys later I hope you

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.959 
guys see you guys later I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:37.819> it
