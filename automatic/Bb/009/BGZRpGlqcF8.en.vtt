I'm<00:00:05.759> standing<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.330> with<00:00:06.540> Thomas<00:00:07.259> Thomas

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I'm standing here with Thomas Thomas

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.220 
I'm standing here with Thomas Thomas
behind<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.179> now<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.510> car<00:00:09.809> access

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
behind this right now is a car access

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.049 
behind this right now is a car access
demo<00:00:10.559> that<00:00:10.679> you've<00:00:11.010> been<00:00:11.190> working<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.700> for<00:00:11.730> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
demo that you've been working on for a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.759 
demo that you've been working on for a
little<00:00:12.300> while<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.750> your<00:00:12.900> pet<00:00:13.080> project<00:00:13.559> so

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
little while it's your pet project so

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.609 
little while it's your pet project so
why<00:00:14.519> don't<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.670> tell<00:00:14.730> me<00:00:15.030> about<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.199> yeah

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
why don't you tell me about this so yeah

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.500 
why don't you tell me about this so yeah
as<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.010> said<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.820> been<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> while<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
as you said it's it's been a while and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.679 
as you said it's it's been a while and
so<00:00:19.140> we're<00:00:19.289> try<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> showcasing<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.390> parts

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so we're try to showcasing all the parts

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
so we're try to showcasing all the parts
of<00:00:21.869> car<00:00:22.170> access<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.769> akma<00:00:23.250> produces<00:00:23.820> all<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
of car access that akma produces all the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.960 
of car access that akma produces all the
different<00:00:24.420> chips<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.340> have<00:00:26.519> three

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
different chips so we have three

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.589 
different chips so we have three
different<00:00:27.150> kinds<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:28.880> communication<00:00:29.880> rke

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
different kinds of communication rke

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
different kinds of communication rke
passive<00:00:31.529> entry<00:00:31.650> passive<00:00:32.130> start<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
passive entry passive start and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410 
passive entry passive start and
immobiliser<00:00:34.760> those<00:00:35.760> three<00:00:36.030> don't

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
immobiliser those three don't

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
immobiliser those three don't
necessarily<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> same

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
necessarily have to be in the same

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.369 
necessarily have to be in the same
system<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.059> used<00:00:39.239> together<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:40.079> all

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
system but can be used together for all

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.540 
system but can be used together for all
kinds<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:41.010> car<00:00:41.700> access<00:00:42.440> systems<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.649> first<00:00:44.399> I'd

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
kinds of car access systems at first I'd

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
kinds of car access systems at first I'd
like<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.539> traditional<00:00:46.320> rke

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
like to show you is a traditional rke

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.190 
like to show you is a traditional rke
which<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> remote<00:00:48.030> keyless<00:00:48.210> entry<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
which is remote keyless entry you just

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
which is remote keyless entry you just
press<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.440> press<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.950> button<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.399> key

press it press the button on your key
and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.629> car<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:51.989> open<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.469> clothes<00:00:52.770> or

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and the car will open more clothes or

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.670 
and the car will open more clothes or
whatever<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.460> action<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.149> pressed

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
whatever the action is that you pressed

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.459 
whatever the action is that you pressed
the<00:00:55.680> next<00:00:56.190> part<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.870> where<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> have<00:00:58.109> key<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
the next part is where you have key in

the next part is where you have key in
your<00:00:58.530> pocket<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.520> don't<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.500> push

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
your pocket and you don't actually push

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.900 
your pocket and you don't actually push
any<00:01:01.680> buttons<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> your

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
any buttons you just have it in your

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.520 
any buttons you just have it in your
pocket<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.820> approach<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> car<00:01:06.470> go<00:01:07.470> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
pocket and you approach the car go to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.390 
pocket and you approach the car go to
the<00:01:07.740> door<00:01:08.070> handle<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> car<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.830> wake<00:01:11.220> up

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the door handle and the car will wake up

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
the door handle and the car will wake up
the<00:01:11.520> key<00:01:11.700> asked<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.220> authentication<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the key asked for the authentication and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
the key asked for the authentication and
it<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.420> open<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> car<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.140> successful

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
it will open the car if it's successful

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
it will open the car if it's successful
the<00:01:18.360> last<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.619> immobilizer

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the last part of it is see immobilizer

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
the last part of it is see immobilizer
where<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.540> key<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
where you put your key into into the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.120 
where you put your key into into the
center<00:01:23.130> stack<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.430> example<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
center stack for example so this is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429 
center stack for example so this is
actually<00:01:26.250> very<00:01:26.840> low<00:01:27.840> distance<00:01:28.229> communication

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
actually very low distance communication

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
actually very low distance communication
and<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.909> press<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> start<00:01:31.020> button<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and you just press the start button and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.000 
and you just press the start button and
if<00:01:34.390> everything's<00:01:34.810> correct<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.590> car<00:01:35.800> will

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
if everything's correct the car will

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.980 
if everything's correct the car will
obviously<00:01:36.310> start<00:01:36.760> so<00:01:37.480> that's<00:01:37.690> three

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
obviously start so that's three

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560 
obviously start so that's three
different<00:01:38.380> kinds<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.860> techniques<00:01:39.610> for<00:01:40.330> car

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
different kinds of techniques for car

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.230 
different kinds of techniques for car
access<00:01:40.930> all<00:01:41.470> use<00:01:41.890> together<00:01:42.280> may<00:01:42.550> be<00:01:42.610> used<00:01:43.030> in

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
access all use together may be used in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.930 
access all use together may be used in
combination<00:01:43.570> may<00:01:44.230> be<00:01:44.290> used<00:01:44.530> separately<00:01:44.940> okay

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
combination may be used separately okay

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.680 
combination may be used separately okay
we'll<00:01:46.180> start<00:01:46.540> with<00:01:46.720> as<00:01:47.100> 70<00:01:48.100> 20<00:01:48.280> which<00:01:49.090> is<00:01:49.210> right

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
we'll start with as 70 20 which is right

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.470 
we'll start with as 70 20 which is right
here<00:01:49.720> in<00:01:50.050> this<00:01:51.040> demo<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.460> does<00:01:51.640> proximity

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
here in this demo it does proximity

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.160 
here in this demo it does proximity
detection<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.870> also<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:56.170> touch<00:01:56.320> detection

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
detection and also the touch detection

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.660 
detection and also the touch detection
it's<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.740> be<00:01:59.830> used<00:02:00.010> in<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.430> car<00:02:01.150> door<00:02:01.390> to

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it's you it can be used in a car door to

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.050 
it's you it can be used in a car door to
receive<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.120> car<00:02:05.050> owners<00:02:05.410> approaching<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
receive the car owners approaching the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.810 
receive the car owners approaching the
next<00:02:07.300> chip<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.840> as<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:09.600> 88<00:02:10.600> 88<00:02:12.510> 59-59<00:02:13.510> 71

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
next chip we have as the 88 88 59-59 71

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.910 
next chip we have as the 88 88 59-59 71
this<00:02:15.820> one's<00:02:16.030> used<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:16.960> LF<00:02:17.200> communication<00:02:17.770> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
this one's used for LF communication and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490 
this one's used for LF communication and
RF<00:02:18.130> communication<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:20.050> already<00:02:20.200> have<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
RF communication so we already have a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
RF communication so we already have a
predecessor<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:21.910> which<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> ad

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
predecessor of this one which is the ad

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.950 
predecessor of this one which is the ad
a<00:02:23.490> 5702<00:02:24.960> which<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.140> available<00:02:26.740> for<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.700> 3d<00:02:28.180> LF<00:02:28.750> as

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
a 5702 which is available for a 3d LF as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.700 
a 5702 which is available for a 3d LF as
well<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.310> does<00:02:31.170> LF<00:02:32.170> with<00:02:32.590> this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
well so this one does LF with this

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.240 
well so this one does LF with this
antenna<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.330> immobiliser<00:02:34.330> was<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.750> one<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
antenna and immobiliser was this one and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.750 
antenna and immobiliser was this one and
i'll<00:02:36.250> create<00:02:36.430> our<00:02:36.670> ke<00:02:36.910> with<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.480> antenna

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
i'll create our ke with this antenna

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760 
i'll create our ke with this antenna
it's<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.910> printed<00:02:40.270> circuit<00:02:40.450> board<00:02:40.750> antenna<00:02:40.989> ok

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
it's a printed circuit board antenna ok

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.070 
it's a printed circuit board antenna ok
let's<00:02:42.220> go<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.580> next<00:02:42.730> chip<00:02:43.000> which<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
let's go to the next chip which is the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.410 
let's go to the next chip which is the
88<00:02:44.650> 88<00:02:45.900> 5831<00:02:47.070> right<00:02:48.070> here<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.209> one's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
88 88 5831 right here so this one's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.330 
88 88 5831 right here so this one's
handling<00:02:50.050> all<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.320> RF<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.160> vehicle<00:02:51.520> side

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
handling all the RF on the vehicle side

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.240 
handling all the RF on the vehicle side
its<00:02:54.340> support<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.120> supports<00:02:55.540> all<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
its support it supports all the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.580 
its support it supports all the
important<00:02:57.250> frequencies<00:02:57.670> 315<00:02:58.420> megahertz<00:02:58.840> 433

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
important frequencies 315 megahertz 433

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.540 
important frequencies 315 megahertz 433
and<00:02:59.770> eight<00:03:00.130> six<00:03:00.340> eight<00:03:00.459> megahertz<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.739> next

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
and eight six eight megahertz then next

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.540 
and eight six eight megahertz then next
one<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.800> ATA<00:03:06.090> 5279<00:03:07.090> which<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.050> one<00:03:08.550> so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
one is the ATA 5279 which is this one so

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.530 
one is the ATA 5279 which is this one so
it<00:03:09.970> does<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.390> LF<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.440> vehicle<00:03:11.650> side<00:03:12.120> 1<00:03:13.120> 25

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
it does see LF on the vehicle side 1 25

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.400 
it does see LF on the vehicle side 1 25
kilohertz<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.980> 6<00:03:15.220> antennas<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.989> are<00:03:17.110> they

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
kilohertz up to 6 antennas we are they

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.600 
kilohertz up to 6 antennas we are they
we<00:03:17.800> already<00:03:18.160> have<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.310> predecessor<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.780> place

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
we already have a predecessor in place

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.070 
we already have a predecessor in place
which<00:03:21.610> basically<00:03:22.540> improves<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> performance

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
which basically improves the performance

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.300 
which basically improves the performance
to<00:03:24.070> up<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.880> 8<00:03:25.300> meters<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:27.340> ATA<00:03:28.260> 5272<00:03:29.310> which

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
to up to 8 meters the ATA 5272 which

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
to up to 8 meters the ATA 5272 which
does<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.820> immobilizer

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
does the immobilizer

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.590 
does the immobilizer
also<00:03:33.250> for<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:33.520> one<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:34.060> predecessor

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
also for this one we have a predecessor

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.350 
also for this one we have a predecessor
in<00:03:34.840> place<00:03:35.020> which<00:03:35.890> basically<00:03:36.700> combines<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
in place which basically combines the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.930 
in place which basically combines the
functionality<00:03:38.020> of<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.410> LF<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
functionality of the LF and the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.960 
functionality of the LF and the
immobilizer<00:03:40.390> functions<00:03:41.290> ok<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.310> here<00:03:42.820> we<00:03:42.940> have

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
immobilizer functions ok so here we have

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.550 
immobilizer functions ok so here we have
C<00:03:43.300> mega<00:03:44.080> 2560<00:03:44.760> hidden<00:03:45.760> behind<00:03:45.880> 270<00:03:46.690> 20<00:03:47.020> doing

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
C mega 2560 hidden behind 270 20 doing

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.030 
C mega 2560 hidden behind 270 20 doing
the<00:03:47.710> main<00:03:48.100> control<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.730> bottom
