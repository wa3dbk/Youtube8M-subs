00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.600
 would like to show you some cool 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.790
 games for ios and yes sorry for so long 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.280
 I did not post the video on this there are special 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.950
 reasons by the way, thank you all for 3000 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.260
 followers drove the first game in my 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 the release is called dragon jump perhaps 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 this is the easiest game in this video 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.020
 here we must avoid or kill 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.000
 dragons game for free in the appstore and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.000
 link to download it will be in the description 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.760
 xenowerk is a dynamic reached shooter for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.309
 iphone and ipad 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 This game is similar to space marshals though 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 this is understandable because these two games are made 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190
 from one studio pixel bytes in the game 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.079
 xenowerk is our goal to pass 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.239
 numerous missions where you need to get 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.870
 information kill aliens or save 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.300
 anyone 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 after each completed assignment to us 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649
 give money to them we can buy armor 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.180
 or weapons by the way about weapons 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 various shops are available to us 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.649
 shotguns lasers grenade launchers and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 so on so don't get bored 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.170
 the game costs 119 rubles in the appstore and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.239
 to me it is worth the money you think 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 flappy bird difficult yes how could not 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.540
 try playing downhill this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.580
 real hardcore 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.860
 in this game we can jump or change 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 lane during check in also here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 different types of transport 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.689
 starting with a shopping cart 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.670
 ends with my piggy bank in what 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 the difficulty of this game is we 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.150
 get down in since mad 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.979
 speed and obstacles appear so 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.390
 quickly so as not to have time to react to 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.390
 them and therefore we crash 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.580
 fourth game is long from appstore but i 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.350
 I recently found it called 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.630
 ridiculous fishing and here we will 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.550
 fish by name, and it is clear from 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.650
 This game is very cool design and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.230
 musical accompaniment is now among 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.400
 gaming is very rare than the more fish we 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.620
 catch in this game 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.020
 the more money we get on them 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.710
 improve fishing line float or buy new 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.660
 weapons game lines me very much 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 tightened and see for the first time in my life 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.020
 a similar game here we have to decide 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.690
 various logic puzzles 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.580
 associated with space it is difficult 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.420
 explain with words take a better look at 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.420
 this with my own eyes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.190
 8-bit water slide and this is very strange 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.720
 for a cool runner for ios on our 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.420
 the path will meet the cliff 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.040
 circular saws knives and stuff in 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.210
 store on the coin we can buy 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 various buns 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:42.450
 magnet well or double jump last 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.910
 rake issue has the name of cue ball 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 ati hybrid bare bowling is our main 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.690
 the task of killing the balls with a cannon and 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.670
 so that they do not leave for the zone 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.670
 which is drawn with a dotted line below 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.430
 I still want to say this again 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.180
