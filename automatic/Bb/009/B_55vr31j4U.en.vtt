 in the company of my companion dew Elizabethan 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 Hello good day 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 it's a pleasure if you have any kind of 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 Question I invite you to access the site 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.670
 dot artist web 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.510
 learning to decorate a room 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.510
 little 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.560
 every day there are more people that we 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.210
 ask for advice on how to decorate a 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.640
 small room and is that with the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.190
 modern trend of the monoambientes and 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.140
 the small apartments for 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.150
 Enjoy a functional room and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.630
 Stylish decoration is required 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.580
 very clever and smart decorating a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.470
 small room means everything a 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.360
 problem for those people who do not 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.940
 they have a lot of knowledge in 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.940
 interior decoration as it achieves 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.060
 create a comfortable and attractive environment in 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.340
 so little space only someone with a 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.470
 well-developed sense of creativity 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.500
 may be able to manage them to 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.780
 transform that place into a bedroom 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.070
 comfortable and functional, even if weird 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.050
 The truth is that we have to 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.330
 get used to small spaces 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.360
 because most of the constructions 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.909
 modern share the same 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.979
 features reduced spaces 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.259
 that's why we have to stop 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.060
 see them as a negative point and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.850
 focus better on the search 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.240
 decorative solutions to optimize them 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.299
 and get the most benefit spaces 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.609
 luminous to reduce the cave effect 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.549
 of the small spaces we will need 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.679
 of correct lighting of course 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.780
 If the room has windows 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.789
 we will open wide to take advantage 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.069
 sunlight but also also 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.500
 We will have to work on creating a 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.899
 efficient artificial luminous circuit and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.929
 suitable for the bedroom remembering that 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.969
 This is an area of relaxation and rest for 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.759
 another side for wall decoration 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.399
 and ceilings we will use light colors and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.420
 we will also opt for them in furniture and 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.610
 few furniture accessories is important 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.150
 that we take care not to fill the room 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.609
 of large and unnecessary furniture 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.200
 small decorative items 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.060
 if you want to add items 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.459
 decoration and give you one more image 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.130
 chic 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 you should limit yourself to just the size 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.410
 small for not 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.819
 too much space correct distribution 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.069
 Of course we will have to work 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.020
 much in the distribution of furniture 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.270
 so that we find the best 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.459
 strategy that allows us to enjoy 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.830
