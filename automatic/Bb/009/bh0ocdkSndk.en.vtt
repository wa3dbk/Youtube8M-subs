now<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.680> means<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:51.860> tm2f<00:00:52.910> 30<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.300> has

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
now that means that this tm2f 30 is has

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.830 
now that means that this tm2f 30 is has
a<00:00:54.750> bigger<00:00:55.590> frequency<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.030> because

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
a bigger frequency but the because

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.720 
a bigger frequency but the because
of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> hospital<00:00:58.680> architecture<00:00:59.190> even<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of the hospital architecture even the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.849 
of the hospital architecture even the

shower<00:01:02.629> 2955<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.899> four<00:01:04.439> times<00:01:04.619> better<00:01:04.979> no<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
shower 2955 you four times better no so

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.100 
shower 2955 you four times better no so
7<00:01:06.299> 2<00:01:06.420> 9550<00:01:07.350> does<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.960> overclocking<00:01:09.960> or

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
7 2 9550 does not have a overclocking or

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.800 
7 2 9550 does not have a overclocking or
turbo<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.680> trouble<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:12.000> still<00:01:12.390> performs

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
turbo for trouble but it still performs

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
turbo for trouble but it still performs
better<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.010> figure<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
better you look at this figure this is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
better you look at this figure this is
actually<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> should<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.950> 1.4<00:01:17.729> degrees

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
actually it should be to 1.4 degrees

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.789 
actually it should be to 1.4 degrees
anyway<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.900> take<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.140> look<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> past

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
anyway let's take a look at the past

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.880 
anyway let's take a look at the past
month<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.030> 7<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.780> 9<00:01:22.080> 55<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
month you can see that the 7 to 9 55 you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.399 
month you can see that the 7 to 9 55 you
is<00:01:23.130> 1.5<00:01:23.790> times<00:01:24.119> C<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.710> n2h<00:01:26.450> 3.net<00:01:27.450> bill<00:01:27.720> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
is 1.5 times C so on n2h 3.net bill but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
is 1.5 times C so on n2h 3.net bill but
what<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.770> me<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> even<00:01:29.909> though<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
what for me to know that even though the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.280 
what for me to know that even though the
m2<00:01:31.159> 830<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.400> low<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.270> performance<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> has

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
m2 830 is low in performance it has

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.399 
m2 830 is low in performance it has
better<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:35.340> better<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> TD<00:01:36.960> period<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
better it's better in the TD period is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130 
better it's better in the TD period is
at<00:01:37.560> some<00:01:37.740> Authority<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.700> 1.5<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.780> if

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
at some Authority that's 1.5 or so if

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
at some Authority that's 1.5 or so if

might<00:01:44.759> want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> work<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.899> 280<00:01:46.350> but

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
might want to work with and 280 but

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.109 
might want to work with and 280 but
remember<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
remember you will not get the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.020 
remember you will not get the
performance<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.659> have<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.820> do<00:01:53.820> with

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
performance and you will have to do with

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.109 
performance and you will have to do with
it<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.259> usually<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:56.850> doing
