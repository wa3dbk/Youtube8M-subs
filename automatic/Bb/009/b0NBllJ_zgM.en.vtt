00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because you have such a soft flexing

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.340 
because you have such a soft flexing
liner<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.210> still<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.660> something<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.260> will

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
liner you still need something that will

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
liner you still need something that will
really<00:00:58.559> stabilize<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.760> boot<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.300> stabilize

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
really stabilize the boot or stabilize

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.349 
really stabilize the boot or stabilize
the<00:01:01.079> liner<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:02.100> give<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> added<00:01:02.940> support

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the liner to give you that added support

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
the liner to give you that added support
because<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> might<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> out<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
because you might want to take it out of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
because you might want to take it out of
the<00:01:05.159> park<00:01:05.400> or<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.909> might<00:01:06.119> want<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.540> extra

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the park or you might want that extra

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.050 
the park or you might want that extra
performance<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> boot<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.280> well<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
performance out of the boot as well so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.320 
performance out of the boot as well so
it<00:01:09.450> helps<00:01:09.750> stabilize<00:01:10.100> a<00:01:11.100> liner<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it helps stabilize a liner like that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
it helps stabilize a liner like that
it's<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.080> bit<00:01:13.260> more<00:01:13.439> softer<00:01:14.010> flexing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it's a little bit more softer flexing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
it's a little bit more softer flexing
you've<00:01:15.000> also<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.600> integrated<00:01:16.140> lacing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you've also got an integrated lacing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
you've also got an integrated lacing
system<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.280> which<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:18.119> nice

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
system on this which is really nice

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.969 
system on this which is really nice
because<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.810> allows<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.650> tighten

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
because it allows you to really tighten

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.880 
because it allows you to really tighten
up<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> liner<00:01:21.049> independent<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.650> show

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
up the liner independent from the show

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.460 
up the liner independent from the show
the<00:01:23.159> boot<00:01:23.340> as<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:23.729> um<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:25.320> let's<00:01:25.590> go<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
the boot as well um now let's go back to

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.100 
the boot as well um now let's go back to
the<00:01:28.470> shell<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> bill<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> women's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the shell of the bill this is a women's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
the shell of the bill this is a women's
specific<00:01:31.290> boot<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> liner<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> shell

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
specific boot so the liner and the shell

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
specific boot so the liner and the shell
are<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.960> specific<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.409> women's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
are going to be specific for women's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
are going to be specific for women's
meaning<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.820> cup<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.210> boot<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
meaning that the cup of the boot is a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
meaning that the cup of the boot is a
little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.409> shorter<00:01:37.799> than<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.130> find<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
little bit shorter than you find on a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
little bit shorter than you find on a
men's<00:01:38.820> boot<00:01:39.140> reason<00:01:40.140> being<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.530> because

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
men's boot reason being is because

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.710 
men's boot reason being is because
women's<00:01:41.220> cast<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.299> lower<00:01:42.509> on

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
women's cast it a little bit lower on

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.440 
women's cast it a little bit lower on
our<00:01:42.899> legs<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> boot<00:01:44.579> accommodates<00:01:45.180> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
our legs so the boot accommodates that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
our legs so the boot accommodates that
now<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> boot<00:01:46.380> itself<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
now the boot itself will also be a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
now the boot itself will also be a
little<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.790> narrower<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.570> fit<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.079> it's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
little bit narrower of a fit and it's

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.859 
little bit narrower of a fit and it's
going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.649> softer<00:01:50.070> flexing<00:01:50.549> then<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> men's

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
going to be softer flexing then a men's

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.190 
going to be softer flexing then a men's
boot<00:01:52.110> would<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.710> well<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.450> lacing<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.960> this

boot would be as well the lacing on this
you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.920> speed<00:01:56.250> zone<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you can see is speed zone and this is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
you can see is speed zone and this is
specific<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> Burton<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> allows

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
specific to Burton and what this allows

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
specific to Burton and what this allows
you<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.670> is<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.509> zonal<00:02:00.899> tightening

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you to do is it's a zonal tightening

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.700 
you to do is it's a zonal tightening
system<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.360> pop<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.079> open<00:02:04.290> we're

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
system that if you pop this open we're

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.290 
system that if you pop this open we're
going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> lose

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
going to lose

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.870 
going to lose
the<00:02:05.450> south<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.870> can<00:02:06.020> actually<00:02:06.200> see<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.880> you've

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
the south I can actually see it you've

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.710 
the south I can actually see it you've
got<00:02:08.830> one<00:02:09.830> chord<00:02:10.100> here<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.790> pull<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
got one chord here that we can pull to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
got one chord here that we can pull to
tighten<00:02:11.960> up<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.290> lower<00:02:12.530> cuff<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.940> one

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
tighten up the lower cuff and that one

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.920 
tighten up the lower cuff and that one
for<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.660> upper<00:02:14.950> right<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.570> point<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
for the upper right here so the point of

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.830 
for the upper right here so the point of
zonal<00:02:18.290> tightening<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.920> obviously<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:20.660> you're

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
zonal tightening is obviously if you're

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.630 
zonal tightening is obviously if you're
more<00:02:21.050> comfortable<00:02:21.160> tightening<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> bottom

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
more comfortable tightening the bottom

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.280 
more comfortable tightening the bottom
but<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.820> want<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.180> leave<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.630> top<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.170> your

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
but you want to leave the top of your

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.260 
but you want to leave the top of your
boot<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.470> little<00:02:24.830> bit<00:02:24.950> looser<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:25.970> ride

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
boot a little bit looser you can ride

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.940 
boot a little bit looser you can ride
like<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.990> really<00:02:27.020> customize<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
like that you can really customize the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.970 
like that you can really customize the
fit<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.400> boot<00:02:28.870> however<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.380> course<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
fit of the boot however of course this

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.670 
fit of the boot however of course this
is<00:02:31.160> also<00:02:31.400> really<00:02:31.880> great<00:02:32.210> for<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:33.260> getting

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
is also really great for really getting

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.490 
is also really great for really getting
your<00:02:34.370> your<00:02:34.820> laces<00:02:35.210> as<00:02:35.450> tight<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.020> want<00:02:36.050> to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
your your laces as tight as you want to

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.920 
your your laces as tight as you want to
they're<00:02:37.460> gonna<00:02:37.580> stay<00:02:37.970> tighten<00:02:38.420> unlike<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
they're gonna stay tighten unlike a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.990 
they're gonna stay tighten unlike a
traditional<00:02:39.410> lacing<00:02:40.100> system<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.610> year<00:02:40.790> you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
traditional lacing system that year you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.270 
traditional lacing system that year you
know<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.390> end<00:02:41.690> up<00:02:41.920> having<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.950> tighten

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
know you end up having to tighten

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.940 
know you end up having to tighten
throughout<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> day<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:45.020> pull<00:02:45.500> these<00:02:45.680> tight

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
throughout the day you pull these tight

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.800 
throughout the day you pull these tight
ones<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.850> these<00:02:47.030> are<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.300> really<00:02:47.570> stay

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
ones and these are going to really stay

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.810 
ones and these are going to really stay
locked<00:02:48.110> into<00:02:48.320> place<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.520> there's<00:02:49.760> a

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
locked into place so there's a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.090 
locked into place so there's a
convenience<00:02:50.390> factor<00:02:50.780> obviously<00:02:50.930> as<00:02:51.530> well

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
convenience factor obviously as well

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.640 
convenience factor obviously as well
there<00:02:52.370> too<00:02:52.580> because<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:53.060> very<00:02:53.300> simple<00:02:53.750> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
there too because it's very simple and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.960 
there too because it's very simple and
again<00:02:54.980> very<00:02:55.220> secure

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
again very secure

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.570 
again very secure
now<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.600> cushioning<00:02:57.110> on<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.500> boot<00:02:57.740> is

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
now the cushioning on this boot is

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.060 
now the cushioning on this boot is
really<00:02:58.880> nice<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.270> you've<00:02:59.570> got<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.070> EST

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
really nice because you've got this EST

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.970 
really nice because you've got this EST
optimized<00:03:01.720> outsole<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.960> what<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.590> does<00:03:03.800> is

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
optimized outsole and what that does is

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.570 
optimized outsole and what that does is
it<00:03:04.130> works<00:03:04.370> with<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:06.140> est<00:03:06.680> bindings<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.310> really

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
it works with the est bindings to really

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.370 
it works with the est bindings to really
give<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:07.940> more<00:03:08.330> comfortable<00:03:08.660> feel<00:03:09.110> that

feel of your board

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.420 
feel of your board
you've<00:03:11.450> got<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.840> b3<00:03:12.320> cushioning<00:03:12.800> inside<00:03:13.220> that

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
you've got the b3 cushioning inside that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.510 
you've got the b3 cushioning inside that
outsole<00:03:13.790> which<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.989> only<00:03:15.680> used<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.160> some<00:03:16.430> of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
outsole which is only used on some of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.729 
outsole which is only used on some of
the<00:03:16.610> some<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> higher-end<00:03:18.050> boots<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
the some of the higher-end boots and

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.470 
the some of the higher-end boots and
it's<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.950> very<00:03:19.220> squishy<00:03:19.610> material<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.360> you'll

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
it's a very squishy material that you'll

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.840 
it's a very squishy material that you'll
find<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.080> anatolian<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.370> heel<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
find in the anatolian the heel of the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.030 
find in the anatolian the heel of the
outsole<00:03:23.330> which<00:03:23.870> is<00:03:24.050> great<00:03:24.380> for<00:03:24.620> dampening

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
outsole which is great for dampening

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.130 
outsole which is great for dampening
vibration<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.880> great<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.330> absorbing<00:03:26.450> shock

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
vibration and great for absorbing shock

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.650
