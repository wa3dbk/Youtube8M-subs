wanted to be but I'm looking forward to
the<00:02:55.980> season<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.340> think<00:02:56.520> we<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.670> ever<00:02:56.760> really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the season I think we can ever really

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.620 
the season I think we can ever really
good<00:02:57.120> one<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.860> like<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.970> kick<00:03:00.150> underwater

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
good one so you like to kick underwater

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.070 
good one so you like to kick underwater
but<00:03:00.960> you're<00:03:01.080> 200<00:03:01.650> guy<00:03:01.830> how<00:03:02.220> far<00:03:02.670> how<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.660> can

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
but you're 200 guy how far how much can

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.450 
but you're 200 guy how far how much can
you<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.230> use<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.680> when<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.310> many

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
you really use that when you're so many

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.680 
you really use that when you're so many
200<00:03:07.400> short<00:03:08.400> course<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.850> think<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.540> use<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
200 short course I think I can use a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.410 
200 short course I think I can use a
pretty<00:03:09.960> well<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:11.100> first<00:03:11.520> time<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.700> tried<00:03:12.060> stay

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
pretty well the first time I tried stay

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.890 
pretty well the first time I tried stay
close<00:03:12.960> to<00:03:13.200> 13<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:13.800> 14<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.460> then<00:03:14.610> back<00:03:15.420> off<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
close to 13 or 14 and then back off and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.479 
close to 13 or 14 and then back off and
wait<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.230> last<00:03:16.410> turn<00:03:16.710> if<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> race

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
wait for that last turn if I'm in a race

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.180 
wait for that last turn if I'm in a race
and<00:03:17.910> I<00:03:18.510> haven't<00:03:18.750> really<00:03:18.870> developed<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.830> whole

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and I haven't really developed the whole

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.370 
and I haven't really developed the whole
back<00:03:20.910> half<00:03:20.940> loss<00:03:21.510> for<00:03:21.810> yet<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.200> we're<00:03:22.290> going

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
back half loss for yet but we're going

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.260 
back half loss for yet but we're going
to<00:03:22.470> work<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.800> next<00:03:22.950> year<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:23.970> think

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
to work on that next year so you think

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.030 
to work on that next year so you think
it's<00:03:24.390> okay<00:03:24.510> for<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.470> your<00:03:25.590> endurance

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
it's okay for you and your endurance

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.040 
it's okay for you and your endurance
you'll<00:03:26.220> still<00:03:26.489> stay<00:03:26.820> underwater<00:03:27.209> for<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> long

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
you'll still stay underwater for a long

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.979 
you'll still stay underwater for a long
time<00:03:28.350> even<00:03:29.130> when<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.520> get<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.820> 150<00:03:30.420> 175

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
time even when you get to that 150 175

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.979 
time even when you get to that 150 175
mark<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:32.340> hoping<00:03:32.700> my<00:03:32.850> next<00:03:33.150> year<00:03:33.300> yeah<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.750> mean

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
mark I'm hoping my next year yeah I mean

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.380 
mark I'm hoping my next year yeah I mean
I<00:03:34.110> figure<00:03:34.500> that's<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.459> fastest<00:03:35.910> way<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.150> can

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
I figure that's the fastest way I can

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.900 
I figure that's the fastest way I can

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
swim so if I probably I can just keep it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.180 
swim so if I probably I can just keep it
