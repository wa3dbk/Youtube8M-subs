00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
of thing you've got like a time limit

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.849 
of thing you've got like a time limit
and<00:00:23.970> you're<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.410> they<00:00:25.470> had<00:00:25.590> six

were<00:00:28.439> available<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.000> essentially

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
were available here and so essentially

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870 
were available here and so essentially
you<00:00:30.570> play<00:00:30.750> either<00:00:30.929> Chris<00:00:31.320> Leon<00:00:32.040> or<00:00:32.219> Jake<00:00:32.399> and

you play either Chris Leon or Jake and
you<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:33.719> waiting<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.050> sort<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> extracted

you are waiting to sort of be extracted

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900 
you are waiting to sort of be extracted
from<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> environment<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
from this environment you just have to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.970 
from this environment you just have to
survive<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.690> long<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.870> possible<00:00:37.020> okay<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
survive for as long as possible okay so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.110 
survive for as long as possible okay so
there's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> time<00:00:38.430> limit<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
there's a time limit and you have to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.270 
there's a time limit and you have to
kill<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.390> many<00:00:39.420> people<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:41.100> can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
kill as many people as you can you can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
kill as many people as you can you can
extend<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:41.820> by<00:00:42.180> killing<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.780> in

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
extend your time by killing people in

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.819 
extend your time by killing people in
some<00:00:42.989> different<00:00:43.110> ways<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> typical

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
some different ways you know a typical

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
some different ways you know a typical
like<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.399> shooting<00:00:45.329> them<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.480> guns<00:00:45.600> give

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
like you shooting them with guns give

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
like you shooting them with guns give
you<00:00:45.930> five<00:00:46.110> seconds<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.920> think<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.700> kill<00:00:47.879> them

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you five seconds I think you kill them

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
you five seconds I think you kill them
with<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> counter-attack<00:00:48.539> maybe<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:48.899> 10

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
with a counter-attack maybe you get 10

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830 
with a counter-attack maybe you get 10
there<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.039> also<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.520> little<00:00:50.730> gems<00:00:50.969> around

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
there are also these little gems around

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.389 
there are also these little gems around
the<00:00:51.989> map<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> extend<00:00:53.309> your

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the map that you can use to extend your

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.689 
the map that you can use to extend your
time<00:00:53.550> um<00:00:55.190> it's<00:00:56.190> kinda<00:00:56.370> interesting<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
time um it's kinda interesting that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.160 
time um it's kinda interesting that
enemies<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> came<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.570> waves<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:58.079> were

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
enemies kind of came in waves there were

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
enemies kind of came in waves there were
moments<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> felt<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.129> though<00:00:59.160> there

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
moments where it felt as though there

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
moments where it felt as though there
weren't<00:00:59.940> enough<00:01:00.059> enemies<00:01:00.719> around<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.320> but

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
weren't enough enemies around me but

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.290 
weren't enough enemies around me but
then<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> same<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:03.030> also<00:01:03.149> get

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
then at the same time could also get

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.520 
then at the same time could also get
overwhelmed<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.229> an<00:01:04.379> interesting

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
overwhelmed so it's an interesting

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.050 
overwhelmed so it's an interesting
balance<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> might<00:01:05.850> need<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
balance and I think it might need a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
balance and I think it might need a
little<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.750> tweaking<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.799> overall<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
little bit of tweaking but overall it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.370 
little bit of tweaking but overall it
seemed<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.360> seemed<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> there

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
seemed it seemed pretty good and there

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
seemed it seemed pretty good and there
are<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.010> modes<00:01:11.310> where<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> do

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
are there are modes where you can do

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
are there are modes where you can do
co-op<00:01:12.150> whether<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.689> split<00:01:12.930> screen<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
co-op whether it's split screen or you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
co-op whether it's split screen or you
can<00:01:14.400> join<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.820> friends<00:01:15.090> game<00:01:15.240> where<00:01:15.420> they

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
can join your friends game where they

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
can join your friends game where they
can<00:01:15.630> hop<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> year<00:01:16.170> game<00:01:16.670> yeah<00:01:17.670> it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
can hop in a year game yeah it's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.070 
can hop in a year game yeah it's
definitely<00:01:18.030> sort<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.600> an<00:01:18.689> hour<00:01:18.780> Katie

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
definitely sort of like an hour Katie

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.140 
definitely sort of like an hour Katie
like<00:01:19.470> action<00:01:19.799> element<00:01:20.250> yeah<00:01:20.520> sort<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> typical

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

yeah<00:01:23.159> yeah<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.060> seem<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
yeah yeah they just seem like the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.880 
yeah yeah they just seem like the
different<00:01:24.720> characters<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> like

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
different characters we're sort of like

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
different characters we're sort of like
bringing<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> same<00:01:26.960> tactics<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> table

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
bringing the same tactics to the table

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
bringing the same tactics to the table
or<00:01:28.799> did<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.100> seem<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.460> maybe<00:01:29.700> different

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
like I said you know was different and I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.469

like the elephant killer right

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.320 
like the elephant killer right
equivalent<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> magnum<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.479> shot

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
equivalent like a magnum one shot

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.420 
equivalent like a magnum one shot
he<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.690> pretty<00:01:54.840> he<00:01:55.050> was<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.350> strong<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.010> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
he was pretty he was pretty strong and I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.680 
he was pretty he was pretty strong and I
you<00:01:56.580> know<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.700> did<00:01:56.880> find<00:01:57.090> myself<00:01:57.300> running<00:01:57.510> at

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
you know I did find myself running at

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.270 
you know I did find myself running at
amo<00:01:57.960> quite<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.800> you<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.190> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
amo quite a bit so you kind of have to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
amo quite a bit so you kind of have to
run<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.760> map<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.090> collect<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.570> which

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
run around the map to collect more which

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
run around the map to collect more which
you<00:02:01.860> know<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.370> it'd<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.880> nice<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.120> you

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you know you think it'd be nice if you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
you know you think it'd be nice if you
could<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.960> more<00:02:04.080> ends<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:05.190> maybe

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
could get them for more ends so maybe

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.040 
could get them for more ends so maybe
we'll<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.760> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> end<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.480> we're<00:02:06.990> all

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
we'll see that in the end but we're all

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.150 
we'll see that in the end but we're all

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it seemed pretty fun and I can see if I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.290 
it seemed pretty fun and I can see if I
can<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.399> people<00:02:08.640> kind<00:02:08.820> of<00:02:08.850> competing<00:02:09.119> with

and the achievements that you get within

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
and the achievements that you get within
the<00:02:24.300> mercenaries<00:02:24.780> mode<00:02:24.810> will<00:02:25.110> translate<00:02:25.470> over

the mercenaries mode will translate over

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
the mercenaries mode will translate over
to<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.120> friends
