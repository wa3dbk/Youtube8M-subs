electricity so it's very important to
make<00:00:30.119> sure<00:00:30.150> you're<00:00:30.420> grounded<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
make sure you're grounded now this is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
make sure you're grounded now this is
where<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.969> actual<00:00:33.270> processor<00:00:33.840> goes<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.380> is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
where the actual processor goes this is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.639 
where the actual processor goes this is
called<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> am3<00:00:35.579> socket<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
called the am3 socket you see this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.920 
called the am3 socket you see this
little<00:00:37.800> lever<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.420> lever<00:00:39.629> here

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.940 

you<00:01:15.440> could<00:01:15.680> go<00:01:16.580> alright<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:17.710> those<00:01:18.710> are<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
you could go alright so those are the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.630 
you could go alright so those are the
pins<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:21.470> see<00:01:21.740> that

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.719 

now<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.170> goes<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.890> you'll<00:01:29.310> notice

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
now the way this goes in you'll notice

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
different from a compound and that all

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.490 
different from a compound and that all
because<00:04:06.970> that's<00:04:07.480> all<00:04:07.630> because<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.079> way<00:04:08.380> it

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
because that's all because of the way it

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.370 
because that's all because of the way it
works<00:04:08.709> if<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.250> soo<00:04:09.549> min<00:04:10.019> with<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.049> microscope

works if you soo min with a microscope

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.009 
works if you soo min with a microscope
to<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.799> processor<00:04:12.489> or<00:04:12.640> any<00:04:13.000> metal<00:04:13.540> surface<00:04:13.870> it's

to a processor or any metal surface it's

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.069 
to a processor or any metal surface it's
been<00:04:14.140> smooth<00:04:14.530> down<00:04:15.239> soon<00:04:16.239> as<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.450> zoom<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.870> to

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
been smooth down soon as you zoom in to

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.690 
been smooth down soon as you zoom in to
a<00:04:17.109> certain<00:04:17.380> point<00:04:17.560> you'll<00:04:17.889> still<00:04:18.220> see<00:04:18.430> rough

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
a certain point you'll still see rough

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.409 
a certain point you'll still see rough
edges<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:20.320> so<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.250> compound<00:04:21.729> builds<00:04:22.330> in

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
edges and so the compound builds in

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.180 
edges and so the compound builds in
those<00:04:22.570> rough<00:04:22.810> edges<00:04:22.960> making<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.530> full<00:04:23.800> firm

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
those rough edges making a full firm

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.710 
those rough edges making a full firm
contact<00:04:24.880> between<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.750> cpu<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.470> heatsink<00:04:26.639> so

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
contact between the cpu and heatsink so

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.610 
contact between the cpu and heatsink so
right<00:04:28.720> now<00:04:28.750> i'm<00:04:29.110> going<00:04:29.289> to<00:04:29.350> go<00:04:29.440> ahead<00:04:29.470> and
