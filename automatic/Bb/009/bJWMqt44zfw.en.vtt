another problem with Asian pears is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130 
another problem with Asian pears is
they're<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.219> prone<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> fire<00:01:03.180> blight<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they're very prone to fire blight and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
they're very prone to fire blight and
that's<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.519> where<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that's what we see up here where it's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's what we see up here where it's
all<00:01:06.360> brown<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.170> crispy<00:01:07.909> fire<00:01:08.909> blight<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
all brown and crispy fire blight is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.000 
all brown and crispy fire blight is
caused<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> bacteria<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.330> enters<00:01:13.010> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
caused by a bacteria that enters the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.999 
caused by a bacteria that enters the
tree<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> certain<00:01:15.240> point<00:01:15.860> when<00:01:16.860> it's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
tree at a certain point when it's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.719 
tree at a certain point when it's
susceptible<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.770> can<00:01:19.770> literally<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
susceptible and can literally I mean it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
susceptible and can literally I mean it
looks<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.360> burnt<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> tree<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
looks like it's burnt the tree and it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 
looks like it's burnt the tree and it
can<00:01:22.860> destroy<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.549> whole<00:01:23.729> tree<00:01:24.439> sometimes<00:01:25.439> we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
can destroy the whole tree sometimes we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.460 
can destroy the whole tree sometimes we
can<00:01:25.890> cut<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.869> rid<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
can cut it out and get rid of it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
can cut it out and get rid of it
this<00:01:29.040> particular<00:01:29.700> tree<00:01:30.030> we're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> wind

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
this particular tree we're going to wind

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.310 
this particular tree we're going to wind
up<00:01:30.990> cutting<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:32.210> because<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.659> infected

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
up cutting down because it's infected

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.550 
up cutting down because it's infected
all<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> trunk<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> there's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
all the way into the trunk so there's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
all the way into the trunk so there's
not<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.270> save

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not going to be a very easy way to save

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.600 
not going to be a very easy way to save
that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.960 

more<00:01:43.610> problems<00:01:44.060> with<00:01:44.510> pairs<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:46.310> there<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.640> are

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
more problems with pairs is there a are

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.500 
more problems with pairs is there a are
susceptible<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:48.200> spring<00:01:48.590> frost<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.270> this

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
susceptible to spring frost so this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.070 
susceptible to spring frost so this
spring<00:01:51.790> we<00:01:52.790> had<00:01:52.940> a<00:01:52.970> lot<00:01:53.210> of<00:01:53.240> frost<00:01:53.630> events

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
spring we had a lot of frost events

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.960 
spring we had a lot of frost events
because<00:01:54.260> if<00:01:54.410> you'll<00:01:54.590> remember<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:55.250> was<00:01:55.400> really

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
because if you'll remember it was really

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.430 
because if you'll remember it was really
really<00:01:56.150> warm<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.810> while<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.080> then<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.320> got

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
really warm for a while and then it got

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.790 
really warm for a while and then it got
cold<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.270> these<00:01:59.270> trees<00:01:59.690> these<00:01:59.990> are<00:02:00.050> host<00:02:00.440> suey

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
cold so these trees these are host suey

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.120 
cold so these trees these are host suey
and<00:02:01.280> they<00:02:02.210> were<00:02:02.270> blooming<00:02:02.720> at<00:02:03.229> just<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.950> wrong

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
and they were blooming at just the wrong

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.859 
and they were blooming at just the wrong
time<00:02:04.190> for<00:02:04.729> frost<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.990> they<00:02:06.350> lost<00:02:07.270> like<00:02:08.270> 90

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
time for frost so they lost like 90

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.110 
time for frost so they lost like 90
percent<00:02:09.320> 95<00:02:09.770> percent<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.550> their<00:02:10.670> crop<00:02:10.910> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
percent 95 percent of their crop and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.420 
percent 95 percent of their crop and
finally<00:02:11.570> on<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.959> these<00:02:12.560> trees<00:02:12.860> I'm<00:02:13.100> walking

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
finally on this these trees I'm walking

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.600 
finally on this these trees I'm walking
past<00:02:13.459> don't<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.060> anything<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:15.610> so

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
past don't have anything on them so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.500 
past don't have anything on them so
that's<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:17.000> problem<00:02:17.239> with<00:02:17.570> pears<00:02:19.300> bring<00:02:20.300> you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's a problem with pears bring you

that's a problem with pears bring you
over<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.050> way<00:02:21.350> here's<00:02:21.770> another<00:02:22.160> problem

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
over this way here's another problem

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.600 
over this way here's another problem
with<00:02:22.820> pears<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.390> addition<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:24.020> birds<00:02:24.610> loving

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
with pears in addition to birds loving

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.979 
with pears in addition to birds loving
them<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.350> do<00:02:27.590> stink<00:02:27.980> bugs<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.570> little

dimple right there

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.509 
dimple right there
is<00:02:32.090> caused<00:02:32.420> by<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> stink<00:02:33.110> bug<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:34.130> like<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
is caused by a stink bug they like to

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.280 
is caused by a stink bug they like to
sit<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.940> pears<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.480> start<00:02:35.720> sucking<00:02:36.140> on

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
sit on the pears and start sucking on

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.000 
sit on the pears and start sucking on
them<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.610> leaves<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.970> little<00:02:38.090> dimple<00:02:39.010> which

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
them and it leaves a little dimple which

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.910 
them and it leaves a little dimple which
then<00:02:40.310> gets<00:02:40.550> Corky<00:02:41.060> inside<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.620> it's<00:02:42.769> not

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
then gets Corky inside so it's not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.050 
then gets Corky inside so it's not
particularly<00:02:43.519> pleasant<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:44.450> eat<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:46.400> here's

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
particularly pleasant to eat and here's

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.630 
particularly pleasant to eat and here's
yet<00:02:47.450> another<00:02:47.600> pretty<00:02:48.260> gruesome<00:02:48.830> fair

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.030 

we<00:02:54.300> also<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.990> thin<00:02:55.290> them<00:02:55.560> by<00:02:55.740> hand

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
we also have to thin them by hand

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.520 
we also have to thin them by hand
because<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.970> when<00:02:57.480> they<00:02:57.660> set<00:02:57.900> fruit<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.380> they

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
because they when they set fruit if they

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.480 
because they when they set fruit if they
haven't<00:02:58.770> been<00:02:58.830> frosted<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.160> thin<00:03:02.340> off

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
haven't been frosted we have to thin off

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.490 
haven't been frosted we have to thin off
all<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.880> extras<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.930> takes<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.290> lot<00:03:04.470> of

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
all the extras so it just takes a lot of

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.460 
all the extras so it just takes a lot of
labor<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.000> kind<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.480> disheartening<00:03:06.720> when

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
labor so it's kind of disheartening when

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.220 
labor so it's kind of disheartening when
you<00:03:08.100> spend<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> time<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.600> on<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.930> tree

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you spend all the time like on this tree

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.860 
you spend all the time like on this tree
which<00:03:10.410> actually<00:03:10.770> had<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> decent<00:03:11.400> crop<00:03:11.750> spend<00:03:12.750> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
which actually had a decent crop spend a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.390 
which actually had a decent crop spend a
lot<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.050> time<00:03:13.350> thinning<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> only<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.330> have

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
lot of time thinning it only to have

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
lot of time thinning it only to have
creatures<00:03:18.860> get<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:20.040> there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.550> destroy<00:03:20.790> the
