00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.520 
and I'm about to go on a date and I
think<00:01:57.810> okay<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> new<00:01:59.040> beginning<00:01:59.159> but

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
think okay this is a new beginning but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.510 
think okay this is a new beginning but
is<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.280> another

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is this just going to be another

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
is this just going to be another
horrible<00:02:02.850> relationship<00:02:03.229> no<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> isn't

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
horrible relationship no it isn't

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.410 
horrible relationship no it isn't
because<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.189> new<00:02:05.399> beginning<00:02:05.880> isn't<00:02:06.060> going

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because this new beginning isn't going

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.729 
because this new beginning isn't going
to<00:02:06.630> contain<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.970> difficulties<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.440> past

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
to contain the difficulties of the past

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.520 
to contain the difficulties of the past
it's<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> be<00:02:11.760> easy

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's going to be easy

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.680 
it's going to be easy
yeah<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.860> then<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> final<00:02:13.730> card<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> high

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

priestess and the High Priestess sits
between<00:02:17.300> these<00:02:17.660> pillars<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.080> good<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.530> evil

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
between these pillars of good and evil

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.699 
between these pillars of good and evil
completely<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.450> stasis<00:02:21.020> with<00:02:21.440> all<00:02:21.590> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
completely in stasis with all the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.559 
completely in stasis with all the
information<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.430> she<00:02:22.520> doesn't<00:02:22.790> do<00:02:22.940> anything

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
information and she doesn't do anything

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.070 
information and she doesn't do anything
she's<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:25.130> okay<00:02:25.790> she's<00:02:26.390> got<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
she's just there okay she's got the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.930 
she's just there okay she's got the
intuition<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.950> other<00:02:28.100> side<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.640> veil

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
intuition on the other side of that veil

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.630 
intuition on the other side of that veil
which<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.630> covered<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.319> she<00:02:30.410> could<00:02:30.709> rest<00:02:31.370> did

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
which is covered so she could rest did

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.640
