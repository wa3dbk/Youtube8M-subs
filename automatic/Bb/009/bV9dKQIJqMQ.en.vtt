00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.350 
do another one another take if you want
to<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.870> we<00:02:24.739> started<00:02:25.069> on<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.250> little<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.239> know

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
to so we started on that little you know

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
to so we started on that little you know
game<00:02:26.599> together

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
game together

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.309 
game together
and<00:02:28.400> each<00:02:28.580> time<00:02:28.880> almost<00:02:29.150> each<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.900> know<00:02:30.050> for

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
and each time almost each you know for

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.890 
and each time almost each you know for
each<00:02:30.440> scene<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:31.010> had<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.400> ask<00:02:31.819> for<00:02:32.239> my<00:02:32.450> second

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
each scene I had to ask for my second

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.920 
each scene I had to ask for my second
take<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.040> was<00:02:34.250> possible<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.660> funny

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
take if it was possible but it's funny

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
take if it was possible but it's funny
because<00:02:36.019> one<00:02:36.650> when<00:02:36.920> there<00:02:37.040> was<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.160> technical

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
because one when there was a technical

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.160 
because one when there was a technical
problem<00:02:37.910> there<00:02:38.180> was<00:02:38.239> no<00:02:38.299> problem<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:38.930> would<00:02:39.019> do

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
problem there was no problem we would do

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.920 
problem there was no problem we would do
another<00:02:39.380> take<00:02:39.680> then<00:02:40.610> was<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.850> human<00:02:41.660> problem

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
another take then was a human problem

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.009 
another take then was a human problem
like<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.680> actors<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.630> know<00:02:44.750> not

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
like the actors you know you know not

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.600 
like the actors you know you know not
being<00:02:45.319> happy<00:02:45.500> he<00:02:45.739> didn't<00:02:46.010> pay<00:02:46.099> attention<00:02:46.190> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
being happy he didn't pay attention to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.240 
being happy he didn't pay attention to
that<00:02:46.849> because<00:02:47.560> well<00:02:48.560> he<00:02:48.709> came<00:02:48.950> from<00:02:49.099> the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that because well he came from the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.800 
that because well he came from the
school<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.700> Poland<00:02:50.150> where<00:02:50.360> they<00:02:50.569> didn't

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
school in Poland where they didn't

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.920 
school in Poland where they didn't
didn't<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> lot<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.739> money<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:53.660> have

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
didn't have a lot of money so they have

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.270 
didn't have a lot of money so they have
to<00:02:54.110> had<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.349> right<00:02:54.620> one<00:02:55.099> take<00:02:55.340> no<00:02:55.390> money<00:02:56.390> to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
to had it right one take no money to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.070 
to had it right one take no money to
bullshitting<00:02:58.310> try<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.090> again<00:02:59.180> oh<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.959> what

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
bullshitting try it again oh and what

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.320 
bullshitting try it again oh and what
about<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.500> what<00:03:00.799> about<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.430> know<00:03:01.610> it

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
about this what about that you know it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.449 
about this what about that you know it
was<00:03:02.540> straightforward<00:03:03.380> that's<00:03:03.950> why<00:03:04.190> he<00:03:04.340> was

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
was straightforward that's why he was

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.970 
was straightforward that's why he was
rehearsing<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.000> way<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:06.140> much<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.829> I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
rehearsing that way that much and I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.319 
rehearsing that way that much and I
think<00:03:07.190> he<00:03:07.250> didn't<00:03:07.519> like<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.820> shooting<00:03:08.120> very

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
think he didn't like the shooting very

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.940 
think he didn't like the shooting very
much<00:03:08.480> because<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> was<00:03:08.930> depending<00:03:09.440> on<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:09.859> many

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
much because it was depending on so many

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.360 
much because it was depending on so many
different<00:03:10.190> things<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.209> know<00:03:11.329> whether

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
different things you know whether

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.960 
different things you know whether
whatever<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> editing<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.549> don't<00:03:16.760> remember

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
whatever so the editing I don't remember

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.660 
whatever so the editing I don't remember
I<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.600> know<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.049> got<00:03:18.590> involved<00:03:18.890> with<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.519> I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
I you know I got involved with that so I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.340 
I you know I got involved with that so I
don't<00:03:19.790> really<00:03:20.090> know<00:03:20.359> from<00:03:20.600> he<00:03:20.840> thought<00:03:20.989> that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
don't really know from he thought that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.229 
don't really know from he thought that
was<00:03:21.530> his<00:03:21.560> world<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.250> he<00:03:22.609> felt<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.030> more

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
was his world because he felt like more

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.940 
was his world because he felt like more
of<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.420> director<00:03:23.870> he<00:03:24.170> was<00:03:24.440> very

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of the director he was very

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
of the director he was very
straightforward<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:26.060> was<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.209> very<00:03:26.480> joyful

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
straightforward it was a very joyful

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.309 
straightforward it was a very joyful
atmosphere<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:28.100> remember<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.239> know<00:03:29.390> laughing

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
atmosphere I remember you know laughing

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.180 
atmosphere I remember you know laughing
and<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:33.170> was<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.290> lightness<00:03:33.859> in<00:03:34.040> it

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
and and there was a lightness in it

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.800 
and and there was a lightness in it
believe<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:34.940> not<00:03:35.060> because<00:03:35.299> at<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.600> same

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
believe it or not because at the same

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.390 
believe it or not because at the same
time<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.109> was<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.230> very<00:03:36.350> tragic<00:03:37.160> film

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
