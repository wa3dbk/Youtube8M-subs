unpleasantness it was a week or two

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.840 
unpleasantness it was a week or two
before<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.890> could<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.670> right

so but you know the bare minimum is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580 
so but you know the bare minimum is
three<00:01:30.000> days<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> 10<00:01:30.810> feet<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.259> that's

three days and up to 10 feet and that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
three days and up to 10 feet and that's
pretty<00:01:31.890> good<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.479> right

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pretty good so what we have here right

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.469 
pretty good so what we have here right
is<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.710> idea<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.820> drives<00:01:36.150> are

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
is the idea that your drives are

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.910 
is the idea that your drives are
protected<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> important<00:01:37.710> part

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
protected because the important part

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
things that the iosafe likes to say it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
things that the iosafe likes to say it's
like<00:01:52.049> look<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.680> everybody<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.159> afford<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like look not everybody can afford to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
like look not everybody can afford to
store<00:01:54.000> terabytes<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> cloud<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
store terabytes in the cloud and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.730 
store terabytes in the cloud and
everybody<00:01:56.490> wants<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> store<00:01:57.689> terabytes<00:01:58.590> in

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
everybody wants to store terabytes in

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
everybody wants to store terabytes in
the<00:01:58.860> cloud<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.149> storing<00:02:00.659> terabytes

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the cloud so you know storing terabytes

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.270 
the cloud so you know storing terabytes
in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> cloud<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.420> expensive<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.189> what<00:02:05.189> we

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
in the cloud is expensive so what we

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.649 
in the cloud is expensive so what we
have<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.820> sort<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.119> layers<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
have here is sort of layers of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.089 
have here is sort of layers of
protection<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.649> we've<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
protection right so we've got the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.589 
protection right so we've got the
enclosure<00:02:08.520> itself<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> sort

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
enclosure itself and I'm going to sort

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.650 
enclosure itself and I'm going to sort
of<00:02:09.690> keep<00:02:10.190> tilting<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.430> around<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
of keep tilting this around and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.810 
of keep tilting this around and
banging<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.500> water<00:02:13.680> out<00:02:13.800> well<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.700> know

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
banging the water out well you know

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.520 
banging the water out well you know
there's<00:02:15.060> nothing<00:02:15.150> worse<00:02:15.450> than<00:02:15.750> keeping<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
there's nothing worse than keeping the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.180 
there's nothing worse than keeping the
drives<00:02:16.770> alive<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.430> destroying<00:02:17.850> them<00:02:18.120> so

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
drives alive and then destroying them so

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.830 
drives alive and then destroying them so
you<00:02:20.190> get<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.520> perfectly<00:02:21.240> done<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
you get it all perfectly done and a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.330 
you get it all perfectly done and a
little<00:02:22.440> short<00:02:22.650> right<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:22.950> pulls<00:02:23.130> out

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
little short right when it pulls out

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.890 
little short right when it pulls out
that<00:02:23.700> would<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.880> really<00:02:24.030> embarrassing<00:02:24.210> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that would be really embarrassing and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.840 
that would be really embarrassing and
personally<00:02:25.290> hurtful<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.160> idea<00:02:26.250> right<00:02:26.640> is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
personally hurtful so the idea right is

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.150 
personally hurtful so the idea right is
that<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.300> store<00:02:27.740> terabytes<00:02:28.740> who<00:02:28.920> have

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that you can store terabytes who have

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.940 
that you can store terabytes who have
access<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> over<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.090> local<00:02:30.480> network

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
access to over your local network

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.440 
access to over your local network
analogy<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.040> great<00:02:32.220> software<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.000> let<00:02:33.270> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
analogy is great software to let you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
analogy is great software to let you
access<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> dual<00:02:34.860> drive<00:02:35.190> over

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
access it then it's a dual drive over

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.640 
access it then it's a dual drive over
your<00:02:35.640> internet<00:02:36.030> yeah<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.410> nice

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
your internet yeah it's a really nice

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.990 
your internet yeah it's a really nice
system<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.160> ontology<00:02:38.520> makes<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.790> really

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
system it's ontology makes a really

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.180 
system it's ontology makes a really
solid<00:02:39.240> Nass<00:02:39.680> anytime<00:02:40.680> I'm<00:02:40.800> dealing<00:02:41.100> with

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
solid Nass anytime I'm dealing with

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.920 
solid Nass anytime I'm dealing with
drive<00:02:41.580> storage<00:02:41.910> portable<00:02:42.360> devices<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.780> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
drive storage portable devices like that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.450 
drive storage portable devices like that
always<00:02:43.080> wants<00:02:43.290> something<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.220> least

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
always wants something that has at least

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.040 
always wants something that has at least
two<00:02:44.760> drives<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.330> can<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.540> some<00:02:45.780> sort<00:02:46.020> of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
two drives so it can do some sort of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.150 
two drives so it can do some sort of
redundancy<00:02:46.530> built<00:02:46.650> into<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> device<00:02:47.250> itself

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
redundancy built into the device itself

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.370 
redundancy built into the device itself
redundancy<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.370> insane<00:02:51.090> yeah<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.900> hey<00:02:52.140> if<00:02:52.230> its

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
redundancy is insane yeah and hey if its

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
redundancy is insane yeah and hey if its
water<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> fireproof<00:02:53.040> too<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:54.090> all<00:02:54.270> over

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
water and fireproof too I'm all over

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420 
water and fireproof too I'm all over
there<00:02:55.020> we<00:02:55.110> go<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.680> part<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.130> fire

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
there we go so this is part of the fire

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.600 
there we go so this is part of the fire
brick<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.030> creates<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.420> enclosure

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
brick it creates this enclosure

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.210 
brick it creates this enclosure
basically<00:02:59.610> it<00:03:00.620> that's<00:03:01.620> gonna<00:03:01.800> be<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> seal

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
basically it that's gonna be the seal

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.200 
basically it that's gonna be the seal
well<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.520> funny<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:02.940> somebody's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
well it's funny it's like somebody's

like well why would you want you know
waterproof<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.730> fireproof<00:03:05.940> well<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.420> your

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
being underwater so we've got the drives

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.260 
being underwater so we've got the drives
in<00:04:29.919> our<00:04:30.039> new<00:04:30.130> enclosure<00:04:30.580> which<00:04:30.970> has<00:04:31.090> been

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
in our new enclosure which has been

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.210 
in our new enclosure which has been
running<00:04:31.720> for<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.900> whopping<00:04:32.139> seven<00:04:32.710> minutes<00:04:33.039> now

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
after we've recovered our drives our

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.379 
after we've recovered our drives our
formerly<00:04:36.340> flooded<00:04:36.849> drives<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.300> were

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
formerly flooded drives that were

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.029 
formerly flooded drives that were
obviously<00:04:37.750> kept<00:04:38.050> safe<00:04:38.349> because<00:04:38.590> look<00:04:38.830> at<00:04:38.919> that

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
obviously kept safe because look at that

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.379 
obviously kept safe because look at that
kids<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:40.210> photos<00:04:40.720> are<00:04:41.020> still<00:04:41.889> there<00:04:42.160> I<00:04:42.400> think

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
kids the photos are still there I think

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.969 
kids the photos are still there I think
if<00:04:43.569> we're<00:04:43.720> really<00:04:43.870> lucky<00:04:43.990> we'll<00:04:44.470> see<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> bunch

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
if we're really lucky we'll see a bunch

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.760 
if we're really lucky we'll see a bunch
of<00:04:45.250> lemons<00:04:45.840> photos<00:04:46.840> inside<00:04:47.229> of<00:04:47.410> here<00:04:47.590> or

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
of lemons photos inside of here or

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.469 
of lemons photos inside of here or
pictures<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> engine<00:04:48.699> of<00:04:48.789> my<00:04:48.940> truck<00:04:49.240> which

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
pictures of the engine of my truck which

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.450 
pictures of the engine of my truck which
is<00:04:49.599> pretty<00:04:49.720> damn<00:04:49.960> done<00:04:50.229> for<00:04:50.500> me<00:04:50.650> but<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.220> idea

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
is pretty damn done for me but the idea

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.629 
is pretty damn done for me but the idea
is<00:04:51.789> that<00:04:52.020> despite<00:04:53.020> their<00:04:53.410> extended<00:04:53.949> soaking

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
is that despite their extended soaking

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.779 
is that despite their extended soaking
the<00:04:55.360> drives<00:04:55.690> are<00:04:56.020> still<00:04:56.500> working<00:04:57.370> which<00:04:57.610> is

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
the drives are still working which is

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.999 
the drives are still working which is
really<00:04:58.090> really<00:04:58.330> like<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.780> or<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.680> system

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
really really like that or is the system

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.129 
really really like that or is the system

working well and of course we mapped it

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.499 
working well and of course we mapped it
out<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.599> fresh<00:05:04.810> drive<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.699> I'm<00:05:06.699> excited<00:05:07.180> I

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
out to the fresh drive and I'm excited I

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.210 
out to the fresh drive and I'm excited I
like<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:08.020> idea<00:05:08.139> that<00:05:08.380> your<00:05:08.680> data<00:05:08.889> can<00:05:09.190> be

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
like the idea that your data can be

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.469 
like the idea that your data can be
protected<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:09.940> there's<00:05:10.120> layers<00:05:10.270> of

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
protected and there's layers of

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.390 
protected and there's layers of
protection<00:05:10.780> look<00:05:11.169> drives<00:05:11.770> are<00:05:11.949> protected

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
protection look drives are protected

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.040 
protection look drives are protected
inside<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:13.000> closures<00:05:13.509> essentially<00:05:13.930> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
inside the closures essentially the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.159 
inside the closures essentially the
enclosure<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.680> is<00:05:15.039> sacrificed<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.750> protect

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
enclosure is is sacrificed to protect

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.990 
enclosure is is sacrificed to protect
the<00:05:17.320> drives<00:05:17.620> it's<00:05:17.949> still<00:05:18.220> dripping<00:05:18.610> out<00:05:18.729> water

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
the drives it's still dripping out water

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.870 
the drives it's still dripping out water
actually<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:20.620> you'd<00:05:21.220> had<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.400> normal<00:05:21.580> hard

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
actually if you'd had a normal hard

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.100 
actually if you'd had a normal hard
drive<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.300> would<00:05:22.419> have<00:05:22.509> gotten<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.810> really<00:05:22.990> good

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
drive it would have gotten a really good

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.399 
drive it would have gotten a really good
bath<00:05:23.289> at<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.590> point<00:05:23.830> heck<00:05:24.190> yeah<00:05:24.370> but<00:05:25.409> iosafe

really need to think about the three two
one<00:06:08.110> plan<00:06:08.320> and<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.949> could<00:06:09.099> end<00:06:09.460> up<00:06:09.580> with<00:06:09.639> like

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
one plan and you could end up with like

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.310 
one plan and you could end up with like
we<00:06:10.150> know<00:06:10.210> one<00:06:10.449> of<00:06:10.479> these<00:06:10.630> enclosures<00:06:10.990> and

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
we know one of these enclosures and

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.899 
we know one of these enclosures and
location<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.889> one<00:06:12.130> of<00:06:12.219> these<00:06:12.310> will<00:06:12.460> enclosures

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
location a one of these will enclosures

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.879 
location a one of these will enclosures
in<00:06:13.060> location<00:06:13.570> B<00:06:13.690> but<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:13.990> idea<00:06:14.349> is<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.620> you

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
in location B but the idea is that you

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.760 
in location B but the idea is that you
have<00:06:15.310> your<00:06:15.729> data<00:06:16.240> spread<00:06:16.690> across<00:06:16.930> at<00:06:17.289> least<00:06:17.469> a

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
have your data spread across at least a

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.820 
have your data spread across at least a
second<00:06:18.580> location<00:06:18.719> where<00:06:19.719> it<00:06:19.870> is<00:06:19.990> secure<00:06:20.409> you

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
second location where it is secure you

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.520 
second location where it is secure you
know<00:06:20.949> and<00:06:21.400> I<00:06:21.729> got<00:06:22.449> to<00:06:22.570> say<00:06:22.599> so<00:06:23.110> knowledge<00:06:23.349> is<00:06:23.440> a

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
know and I got to say so knowledge is a

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.290 
know and I got to say so knowledge is a
nice<00:06:23.710> nass<00:06:24.009> iously<00:06:24.580> it<00:06:24.669> does<00:06:24.820> a<00:06:24.849> nice<00:06:25.090> and
