down<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.480> human<00:02:31.720> voice<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.650> fact<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
down to the human voice in fact with the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.660 
down to the human voice in fact with the
human<00:02:33.670> voice<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.209> slur<00:02:34.769> actually<00:02:35.769> contains<00:02:36.220> all

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
human voice a slur actually contains all

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.720 
human voice a slur actually contains all
the<00:02:36.880> notes<00:02:37.090> between<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.870> slur<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.470> is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the notes between the slur it is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.699 
the notes between the slur it is
essentially<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> very<00:02:40.269> very<00:02:40.600> quick<00:02:40.900> glide

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
essentially a very very quick glide

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.580 
essentially a very very quick glide
between<00:02:42.610> notes<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.690> inevitable<00:02:44.319> when<00:02:44.440> you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
between notes it's inevitable when you

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.350 
between notes it's inevitable when you
sing<00:02:44.920> if<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.489> sing<00:02:45.700> from<00:02:45.850> one<00:02:46.030> note<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
sing if you sing from one note to the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080 
sing if you sing from one note to the
next<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.890> will<00:02:48.070> get<00:02:48.280> all<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.940> notes

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
next and you will get all the notes

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.539 
next and you will get all the notes
between<00:02:49.299> very<00:02:49.840> quickly<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.500> also<00:02:51.340> play<00:02:51.519> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
between very quickly I also play the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.340 
between very quickly I also play the
French<00:02:51.880> horn<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> French<00:02:52.720> horn<00:02:52.989> has<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
French horn and the French horn has that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.319 
French horn and the French horn has that
same<00:02:53.709> quality<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.519> getting<00:02:54.790> all<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.120> notes

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
same quality of getting all the notes

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.440 
same quality of getting all the notes
between<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.260> slur<00:02:57.000> stringed<00:02:58.000> instruments

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
between the slur stringed instruments

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
between the slur stringed instruments
can<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.019> also<00:02:59.320> sliding<00:03:00.100> on<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.250> string

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
can do that also sliding on the string

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.819 
can do that also sliding on the string
and<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.390> bowing<00:03:01.810> techniques<00:03:02.230> enable

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
and the bowing techniques enable

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.160 
and the bowing techniques enable
different<00:03:03.040> types<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.640> phrasing<00:03:04.090> as<00:03:04.209> well<00:03:04.480> now

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
different types of phrasing as well now

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.690 
different types of phrasing as well now
on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.380> piano<00:03:05.680> if<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.100> were<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.340> play<00:03:06.489> those

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
on the piano if I were to play those

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.479 
on the piano if I were to play those
same<00:03:06.970> series<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.570> notes<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.079> try<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.040> get<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
same series of notes and try to get the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.479 
same series of notes and try to get the
sound<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.150> slur<00:03:10.650> what<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.680> would<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
sound of a slur what I would do is

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.940 
sound of a slur what I would do is
overlap<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.630> notes<00:03:13.840> slightly<00:03:14.410> which

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
overlap the notes slightly which

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.759 
overlap the notes slightly which
technically<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.730> not<00:03:15.790> what<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> slur<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:17.049> but

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
technically is not what a slur is but

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.069 
technically is not what a slur is but
it's<00:03:17.890> actually<00:03:18.459> physically<00:03:19.329> impossible<00:03:19.660> to

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
it's actually physically impossible to

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.590 
it's actually physically impossible to
get<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> true<00:03:20.620> slur<00:03:21.010> out<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> piano<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.209> like

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
get a true slur out of the piano so like

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.720 
get a true slur out of the piano so like
many<00:03:22.840> aspects<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.440> piano<00:03:23.739> it's<00:03:24.100> an<00:03:24.220> illusion

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
many aspects of piano it's an illusion

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.670 
many aspects of piano it's an illusion
so<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.480> how<00:03:25.570> I<00:03:25.600> would<00:03:25.989> play<00:03:26.200> those<00:03:26.410> notes

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so this is how I would play those notes

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:38.030 
so this is how I would play those notes
if<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:26.950> was<00:03:27.070> playing<00:03:27.280> them<00:03:27.459> slurred

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.400 

so<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.190> a<00:03:39.250> very<00:03:39.460> smooth<00:03:39.910> sound<00:03:40.390> by<00:03:40.720> slightly

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
so it's a very smooth sound by slightly

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.700 
so it's a very smooth sound by slightly
overlapping<00:03:42.310> each<00:03:42.790> note<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.420> if<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.380> was<00:03:44.500> not

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
overlapping each note and if it was not

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.340 
overlapping each note and if it was not
written<00:03:44.920> slurred<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.670> put<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> slight<00:03:46.960> bit<00:03:47.260> of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
written slurred I put a slight bit of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.500 
written slurred I put a slight bit of
space<00:03:47.620> between<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.130> notes<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.150> doesn't

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
space between the notes so it doesn't

00:03:49.510 --> 00:04:01.020 
space between the notes so it doesn't
sound<00:03:49.990> slurred<00:03:59.520> so<00:04:00.520> these<00:04:00.700> are<00:04:00.820> subtle

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
sound slurred so these are subtle

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.330 
sound slurred so these are subtle
differences<00:04:01.300> and<00:04:02.050> there<00:04:02.440> are<00:04:02.590> many<00:04:02.950> different

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
differences and there are many different

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.640 
differences and there are many different
shadings<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.000> phrasings<00:04:04.600> within<00:04:04.900> slurs<00:04:05.260> and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
shadings of phrasings within slurs and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.710 
shadings of phrasings within slurs and
notes<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:05.950> are<00:04:06.130> not<00:04:06.370> slurred<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:07.060> well<00:04:07.600> as

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
notes that are not slurred as well as

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.230 
notes that are not slurred as well as
the<00:04:07.840> myriad<00:04:08.290> other<00:04:08.520> phrasing<00:04:09.520> possibilities

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
the myriad other phrasing possibilities

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.700 
the myriad other phrasing possibilities
that<00:04:10.360> composers<00:04:10.780> write<00:04:10.960> in<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.170> music

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
that composers write in the music

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.590 
that composers write in the music
