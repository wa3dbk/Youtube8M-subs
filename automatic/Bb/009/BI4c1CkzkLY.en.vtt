know<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.790> scoreboard<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
know this we have a scoreboard it's a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
know this we have a scoreboard it's a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.210 
similar what's identical to listen the
corset<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.050> keeps<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.350> score<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.830> for<00:02:47.130> this

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
corset so it keeps a score for for this

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.260 
corset so it keeps a score for for this
particular<00:02:47.430> game<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.270> forth<00:02:56.030> we'll<00:02:57.030> go<00:02:57.210> to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
particular game and so forth we'll go to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.230 
particular game and so forth we'll go to
settings<00:02:58.080> down<00:02:58.400> there's<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> few<00:02:59.670> settings<00:03:00.000> so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
settings down there's a few settings so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
now the lessons that we've been using so

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
now the lessons that we've been using so

within the range that we we selected in

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.880 
within the range that we we selected in
it's<00:04:54.850> also<00:04:55.270> it's<00:04:55.600> completely<00:04:56.290> random<00:04:56.620> because

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
it's also it's completely random because

it's also it's completely random because
we<00:04:57.460> certainly<00:04:57.730> never<00:04:57.910> encountered<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.630> number

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
to have that so I decided put a toggle

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.630 
to have that so I decided put a toggle
in<00:06:16.630> here<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.440> can<00:06:17.920> look<00:06:18.070> not<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.460> have<00:06:18.610> it

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
in here so you can look not to have it

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.330 
in here so you can look not to have it
so<00:06:18.970> go<00:06:19.150> back<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.360> the<00:06:19.780> same<00:06:19.930> number<00:06:21.540> 888<00:06:23.340> simply

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
so go back to the same number 888 simply

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.210 
so go back to the same number 888 simply
that

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
that

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.450
