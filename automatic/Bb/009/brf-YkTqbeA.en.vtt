gonna have your typical workouts for
that<00:00:39.300> muscle<00:00:39.600> right<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> shouldn't

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that muscle right so if you shouldn't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400 
that muscle right so if you shouldn't
pick<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.730> your<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:42.360> triceps<00:00:43.350> for

pick up your your your triceps for

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
pick up your your your triceps for
instance<00:00:43.860> you're<00:00:44.010> gonna<00:00:44.129> hit<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.370> triceps

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
instance you're gonna hit your triceps

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.920 
instance you're gonna hit your triceps
on<00:00:44.850> arm<00:00:45.090> day<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.420> you're<00:00:45.510> gonna<00:00:45.600> hit<00:00:45.719> them<00:00:45.899> on

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
on arm day and you're gonna hit them on

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.479 
on arm day and you're gonna hit them on
when<00:00:46.440> you're<00:00:46.559> doing<00:00:46.770> chest<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> don't

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
when you're doing chest when you don't

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.020 
when you're doing chest when you don't
shoulders

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
shoulders

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.130 
shoulders
so<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:50.460> frequency<00:00:51.210> part<00:00:51.449> training<00:00:51.840> everyday

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so the frequency part training everyday

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
so the frequency part training everyday
does<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.620> mean<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> full-blown<00:00:53.489> workout

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
does not mean have a full-blown workout

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.220 
does not mean have a full-blown workout
I<00:00:54.180> made<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> video<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.899> doesn't<00:00:55.020> mean

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
I made a video about it doesn't mean

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
I made a video about it doesn't mean
have<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> full-blown<00:00:55.710> workout<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
have a full-blown workout for that

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
have a full-blown workout for that
muscle<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:57.870> day<00:00:58.020> simply<00:00:58.440> means<00:00:58.620> stimulate

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

do<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> by<00:01:09.299> stimulating<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> muscle

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
do that by stimulating the muscle

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
do that by stimulating the muscle
putting<00:01:11.100> someone<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.939> some<00:01:12.150> damage<00:01:12.540> on

have your you know a day to train a

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.830 
have your you know a day to train a
muscle<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> other

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
muscle and you do use it in other

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.410 
muscle and you do use it in other
movement<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.490> exercise<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
movement or it is one exercise and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.460 
movement or it is one exercise and
that's<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:24.630> people<00:01:24.720> always<00:01:24.990> pick<00:01:25.290> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that's how people always pick an

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.200 
that's how people always pick an
isolation<00:01:26.100> movement<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.700> three<00:01:27.090> reasons

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
isolation movement for three reasons

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.800 
isolation movement for three reasons
number<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:28.820> it's<00:01:29.820> safer<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.270> your<00:01:30.450> joints

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
number one it's safer on your joints

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.910 
number one it's safer on your joints
right<00:01:31.020> cuz<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.590> hitting<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
right cuz you're gonna be hitting that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649

delts your bicycles are gonna come into
play<00:02:20.580> isolation<00:02:21.580> movements<00:02:22.030> unless<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
play isolation movements unless you

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.780 
play isolation movements unless you
focus<00:02:23.020> on<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.230> move<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:24.220> muscle<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
focus on a move on that muscle that

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.480 
focus on a move on that muscle that
right<00:02:25.480> angle<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.100> improve<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.220> where<00:02:27.370> it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
right angle and improve it where it's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.430 
right angle and improve it where it's
lagging<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.120> use<00:02:28.360> an<00:02:28.480> isolation<00:02:28.930> movement<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
lagging so use an isolation movement and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.900 
lagging so use an isolation movement and
if<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.950> reason<00:02:30.130> obviously<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:33.700> not

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
if the reason obviously is on it's not

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.850 
if the reason obviously is on it's not
taxing<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.660> not<00:02:34.810> taxing<00:02:35.350> on<00:02:35.470> your<00:02:35.620> central

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
taxing it's not taxing on your central

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.680 
taxing it's not taxing on your central
nervous<00:02:35.950> system<00:02:36.160> right<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.820> for<00:02:37.420> example

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
nervous system right so for example

why<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.640> works<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.570> was<00:04:22.690> able<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.930> figure

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
why this works so I was able to figure

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.290 
why this works so I was able to figure
out<00:04:23.290> exactly<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:24.610> know<00:04:24.730> cuz<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.090> said<00:04:25.210> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
out exactly you know cuz like I said the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.520 
out exactly you know cuz like I said the
study<00:04:25.510> hasn't<00:04:25.810> been<00:04:25.930> done<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.290> yet<00:04:26.500> so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
study hasn't been done on it yet so

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.080 
study hasn't been done on it yet so
right<00:04:26.620> that's<00:04:26.830> pure<00:04:27.130> bro<00:04:27.310> science<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:27.910> based

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
right that's pure bro science but based

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.030 
right that's pure bro science but based
on<00:04:28.210> feedback<00:04:28.450> we<00:04:28.660> could<00:04:28.900> really<00:04:29.050> tell<00:04:29.290> why<00:04:29.980> it

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
on feedback we could really tell why it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.860 
on feedback we could really tell why it
works<00:04:30.400> how<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.790> works<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.300> this<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.600> so

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
works how it works and this and that so

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.360 
works how it works and this and that so
leave<00:04:32.320> enough<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.530> us<00:04:32.710> with<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.950> guys<00:04:33.250> I'm
