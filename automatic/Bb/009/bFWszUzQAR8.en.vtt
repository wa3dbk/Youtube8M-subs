00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700
 1 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 hi to all and of course the chain 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.060
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 to make nolly 3.6 bac we left 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.720
 then the prerequisites for the liter too 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.120
 down there will be three trick will be the no 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.530
 read the name the bins and the hk I you 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.530
 explain why we need the lkp 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 good I explained you the nolly 3,6 bac 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 so his intrigues lady in front there is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 you do not need to do big tricks 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.290
 for not being that money so I you 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.200
 explained to have the placement of 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.820
 feet so you have to know that already the nolly 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.380
 3.6 joke it's a type that is done in 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 aulide have seen that I am handsome son and 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.420
 my right foot that will serve you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.799
 My client is going to be used to scrape 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.970
 the placement of peas had known to your 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.140
 back foot you're going to put a little 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 cool like this so that means 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.750
 by the way, at the back, the toes 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 that come out slightly and the front dish 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.810
 we will put it rather like that so 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 like for an all in so that means 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.360
 a little teased like that diagonally 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.640
 with the greatest distance on the terminal and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.020
 level of cable tale the country must be 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.970
 pretty much like this and this particular because 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.010
 comes out slightly sees the first step 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.900
 we place ourselves as his second step is going 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.600
 have to pop and so it's like for a 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.720
 pretty 3 6 as for an all i bac on va 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.549
 pop and like that we will scratch and finally 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.570
 shoulders your shoulders before turning 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 like that we make them cold in the back 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.180
 the hx1 bench with its water tank will be there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.869
 paid the canton in 220 so we are 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.150
 like that hop we swing our stuff 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.479
 we turn our shoulders and there we go 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.780
 happen like that we did half the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.570
 path 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 it's good to finish the trick I got you 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.629
 said you had to know how to do the half 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.189
 cab is actually separately the tap it 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.049
 must know how to do it is especially the f 4 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.170
 batteries or for that matter learned like that one 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:20.129
 pop like that I explain why 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 we make our beds we turn we will turn 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.709
 and here we come 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.769
 and after that it's like for a f4 says 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.090
 that we will arrive like that will have to do 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.800
 the the pivot to the bearer so what they 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 take sign up to montredon strict 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.060
 that's when the whole fire is one 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.799
 unconvincing pivot it goes but good 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.599
 so we put ourselves like that so there actually 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.489
 who will be able to give as a sacred 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.420
 force in your shoulders what it takes 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.980
 turn in 3 6 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.410
 so in fact it's already fucked but the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.319
 force to turn 280 and after having 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 given the other force to make the pivot 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.920
 so we're like that so already the what 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.110
 is also what is practical is 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.760
 to go a little diagonally like that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.410
 you will already have a few degrees less 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.940
 and it will make your job easier in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.379
 start so we're like that hop on z pop 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.780
 and a maximum like that his side that that 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:17.530
 go off with the back foot 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.299
 so we scratch and in fact the thing is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.769
 we're going to scratch and your fears happened 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.150
 as it happens like that with the foot there 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:31.239
 at the conclave to watch a 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.370
 mobility with this mobility to make 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.319
 the pivot and you will have another one so this 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.030
 bac is that at the beginning the falls that 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.700
 risk of you happening it's going to be kind 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.040
 that's it you 're not going to have the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:48.549
 reflex to turn to nantes there you 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:53.260
 go do that nolita classic other 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.730
 worry it's you to epic up and you 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.109
 will not have the reflex to just stay on 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.930
 your rear wheels to see turn and 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.419
 so how are you doing on your 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.819
 telly that to black tool block black and 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.370
 you have beautiful if not what 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.780
 who is still so yes this one this is 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.510
 the hardest thing is if you take the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.169
 time you tried your thing 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.450
 hop yes I'm on the board hello and there 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.609
 we are going to arrive like this and we will not see 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.109
 Tournai reflex and sylvana a lot 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.979
 speed we're going like a big faith 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.050
 take it like that 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.940
 laborde will stop net and you have 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.420
 found for the front and we will be done 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.580
 very very badly 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.410
 so it's patrick yes but it's a 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.680
 thing that's easy so continue 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.910
 like that we turn the shoulder pop on 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:42.850
 skyscrapers in Pandaria for this tour 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:46.550
 we keep our mobility is there the pivot 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.230
 and if returned so here is the name liters 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.530
 stores his intrigues this easy and 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.420
 it was mostly a tutorial to wait in 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.880
 make the arrival because it's a sad 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.110
 that I master almost normally 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.070
 so that means that there is a little bit of fun 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.150
 but his pass is I finally understood 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.340
 how so I'll start 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.480
 do something too but that's what happens 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.950
 were there it was mostly for 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.100
 wait already it's a tricks that passes 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.290
 well in the line on pira for full 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.060
 of holes that I know nothing you have that 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.500
 to find 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.410
 so here's yeah I wanted to tell you 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.770
 also before leaving there this week 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.480
 I am enriched his tray and yeah that's 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.450
 hard life and so to his problem I 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.340
 pass the beak even more you arrive and 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.780
 so I can not offered our earlier 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.310
 beaches actually already there one during my 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.300
 week because I got enough 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.460
 long time I did not do it earlier 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.250

 pretty much under my feet I'm plating it 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.140
 often it is beautiful in itself depends on 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.060
