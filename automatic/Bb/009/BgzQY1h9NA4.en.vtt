00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here in the states at least this a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 
here in the states at least this a
little<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.490> higher<00:01:53.670> than<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:54.149> premium<00:01:54.509> guys

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little bit higher than have premium guys

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.929 
little bit higher than have premium guys
in<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.049> places<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.369> think<00:01:56.610> that's<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
in some places and you think that's the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
in some places and you think that's the
main<00:01:57.119> factor<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.689> people<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.259> got<00:01:58.439> out

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
main factor that people have not got out

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.609 
main factor that people have not got out
to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.490> drive<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.880> very<00:02:00.180> technology<00:02:00.619> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
to get to drive this very technology it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.010 
to get to drive this very technology it
has<00:02:02.100> been<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.579> diesel<00:02:02.969> prices<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.990> been

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
has been one diesel prices have been

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.539 
has been one diesel prices have been
slightly<00:02:04.380> higher<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> states<00:02:05.250> through

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
slightly higher in the states through

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.940 
slightly higher in the states through
the<00:02:05.670> years<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:06.960> as<00:02:07.140> customers

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the years but we think as customers

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
the years but we think as customers
research<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.700> look<00:02:09.330> at<00:02:09.420> cost<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
research it and look at cost of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.390 
research it and look at cost of
ownership<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> car<00:02:10.739> especially

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
ownership for the car especially

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.370 
ownership for the car especially
considering<00:02:12.000> longer<00:02:12.959> maintenance

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
considering longer maintenance

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.240 
considering longer maintenance
intervals<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.160> residual<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> car<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
intervals and residual of the car in the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.280 
intervals and residual of the car in the
use<00:02:17.520> market<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.810> diesel<00:02:19.110> option

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
use market the the diesel option

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.720 
use market the the diesel option
certainly<00:02:19.740> becomes<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.430> competitive

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
certainly becomes much more competitive

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.270 
certainly becomes much more competitive
yeah<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.650> words<00:02:22.890> like<00:02:23.010> in

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
yeah so you know you know words like in

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280 
yeah so you know you know words like in
the<00:02:23.400> long<00:02:23.580> term<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.080> short

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the long term is actually in the short

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.810 
the long term is actually in the short
term<00:02:25.440> too<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.520> driving

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
term too because like that the driving

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.850 
term too because like that the driving
experience<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.270> really<00:02:27.420> what<00:02:27.720> good<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.740> in

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
experience is really what good but in

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
experience is really what good but in
the<00:02:28.980> long<00:02:29.130> term<00:02:29.160> like<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.970> money<00:02:30.210> that<00:02:30.420> you

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the long term like the money that you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.690 
the long term like the money that you
will<00:02:30.660> probably<00:02:31.080> spend<00:02:31.200> upfront<00:02:32.130> paying<00:02:32.490> for

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
will probably spend upfront paying for

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
will probably spend upfront paying for
that<00:02:32.850> extra<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.450> engine<00:02:33.870> because

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
that extra for that engine because

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480 
that extra for that engine because
they're<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.650> bit<00:02:34.800> more<00:02:34.920> expensive<00:02:35.160> right

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
they're little bit more expensive right

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.610 
they're little bit more expensive right
oh<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.330> are<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.540> detail<00:02:36.840> yeah<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.350> then

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
oh that they are in detail yeah and then

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.560 
oh that they are in detail yeah and then
I'd<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.310> paying<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.360> diesel

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
I'd like that paying for that diesel

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'd like that paying for that diesel
every<00:02:39.870> time<00:02:40.050> but<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.500> long<00:02:40.710> term<00:02:40.950> it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
every time but on the long term it's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.910 
every time but on the long term it's
that<00:02:42.150> everything<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.690> subset<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.650> saying

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
that everything that subset I'm saying

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920 
that everything that subset I'm saying
right<00:02:44.010> oh<00:02:44.280> yeah<00:02:44.700> again<00:02:45.210> looking<00:02:45.510> at<00:02:45.630> long-term

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
right oh yeah again looking at long-term

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.920 
right oh yeah again looking at long-term
total<00:02:46.560> cost<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:47.040> ownership<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.970> feel<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
total cost of ownership we feel that the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020 
total cost of ownership we feel that the
premium<00:02:49.320> for<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> engine<00:02:49.710> is<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.730> greatly

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
premium for the engine is is greatly

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.810 
premium for the engine is is greatly
offset<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.710> addition<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.490> offers

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
offset and in addition that it offers

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.330 
offset and in addition that it offers
great<00:02:54.060> driving<00:02:54.660> fun<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> owner<00:02:55.500> yes<00:02:56.040> poor
