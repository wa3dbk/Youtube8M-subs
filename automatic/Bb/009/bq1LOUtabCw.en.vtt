00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
moves by you know obviously pretty quick

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.120 
moves by you know obviously pretty quick
it's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> repetitive<00:00:57.360> lick<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.860> it's

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
it's a repetitive lick but is how it's

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.620 
it's a repetitive lick but is how it's
played<00:00:59.520> how<00:00:59.760> many<00:00:59.910> times<00:01:00.120> played<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.540> that

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
played how many times played in that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.180 
played how many times played in that
intro<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.110> how<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.320> time<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.830> be<00:01:01.950> a<00:01:01.980> bit

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
intro and how it's time can be a bit

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.400 
intro and how it's time can be a bit
confusing<00:01:02.580> so<00:01:02.820> let's<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.900> learn<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> lick

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
confusing so let's just learn the lick

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.990 
confusing so let's just learn the lick
first<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> kind<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.220> show<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
first and I kind of show you a way of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.130 
first and I kind of show you a way of
thinking<00:01:06.120> about<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
thinking about it so you can time it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.469 
thinking about it so you can time it
right<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.520> we're<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> start

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.960 
alright so six times all the way through
and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:40.030> once<00:02:41.430> he<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:42.640> does<00:02:42.790> that

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
and then just once he just does that

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.000 
and then just once he just does that
much<00:02:43.210> of<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.510> then<00:02:44.230> he<00:02:44.260> starts<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.860> whole

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
much of it then he starts the whole

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.900 
much of it then he starts the whole
thing<00:02:45.220> over<00:02:45.400> again

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
thing over again

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.080 
thing over again
the<00:02:46.750> real<00:02:47.020> lick<00:02:47.290> played<00:02:47.680> two<00:02:48.250> times<00:02:48.280> all<00:02:48.820> the

the real lick played two times all the
way<00:02:49.180> through<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.140> had<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.590> half<00:02:51.490> way

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
way through so we had this half way

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.160 
way through so we had this half way
through<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:53.250> name<00:02:54.250> start<00:02:54.610> over

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
oh that's our fret and then do five to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.130 
oh that's our fret and then do five to
zero<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.980> then<00:03:24.790> you're<00:03:25.239> gonna<00:03:25.329> start<00:03:25.989> making

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
zero and then you're gonna start making

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440 
zero and then you're gonna start making
your<00:03:26.290> way<00:03:26.409> to<00:03:26.469> that<00:03:26.650> main<00:03:26.890> riff<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:28.239> can<00:03:28.359> hit

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
your way to that main riff you can hit

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
all right so that's a cool one pretty

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.120 
all right so that's a cool one pretty
easy<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.170> play<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.380> soon<00:04:01.800> as<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
easy to play to soon as you get the

easy to play to soon as you get the
timing<00:04:02.430> down<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.000> it's<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.300> open<00:04:04.200> low<00:04:04.320> E

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
timing down so it's just open low E

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.890 
timing down so it's just open low E
string<00:04:04.530> then<00:04:05.100> two<00:04:05.370> three<00:04:05.610> four

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900

all right so just practice those a

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.410 
all right so just practice those a
timing<00:04:41.370> can<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.610> little<00:04:41.850> bit<00:04:41.940> weird<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.270> both

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
timing can be a little bit weird of both

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.320 
timing can be a little bit weird of both
of<00:04:42.630> them<00:04:42.810> and<00:04:43.560> then<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:44.910> kind<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.090> gets<00:04:45.270> you

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
of them and then that kind of gets you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.060 
of them and then that kind of gets you
ready<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.690> learn<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.500> rest<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.860> song
