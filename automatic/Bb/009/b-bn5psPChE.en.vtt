00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 Marriages go tomorrow 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 that was all prepared 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.680
 but the big surprise 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.400
 confusing 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.440

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.260

 on 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.060

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.800
 let house 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.040
