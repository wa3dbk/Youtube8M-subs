hi I'm Yossi and today I want to go over

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.929 
hi I'm Yossi and today I want to go over
with<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.560> main<00:01:09.920> riff<00:01:10.189> from<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.549> song

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
with you on the main riff from a song

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.109 
with you on the main riff from a song
titled<00:01:11.720> numbers<00:01:12.380> world<00:01:12.680> from<00:01:13.430> my<00:01:13.549> solo<00:01:13.790> album

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
titled numbers world from my solo album

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.680 
titled numbers world from my solo album
melting<00:01:14.450> clocks<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:16.100> reef<00:01:16.369> is<00:01:16.690> it's

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
melting clocks and this reef is it's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.600 
melting clocks and this reef is it's
kind<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:17.990> interesting<00:01:18.530> because<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.040> mixes<00:01:19.580> a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
kind of interesting because it mixes a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.710 
kind of interesting because it mixes a
couple<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.540> scales<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.200> let's<00:01:22.330> break<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.479> down

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
couple of scales and let's break it down

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620 
couple of scales and let's break it down
to<00:01:24.229> core<00:01:24.830> components<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.610> see<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.360> we<00:01:26.479> have

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
to core components and see what we have

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.010 
to core components and see what we have
going<00:01:26.810> there<00:01:27.850> because<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.970> does<00:01:29.149> makes<00:01:29.450> some

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
going there because it does makes some

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.070 
going there because it does makes some
scales<00:01:30.440> some<00:01:30.830> exotic<00:01:31.280> stuff<00:01:31.490> there<00:01:32.080> along

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
scales some exotic stuff there along

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.350 
scales some exotic stuff there along
with<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.350> groove<00:01:33.860> element<00:01:34.700> some<00:01:35.000> sort<00:01:35.270> of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
with a groove element some sort of

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.990 
with a groove element some sort of
rhythmic<00:01:35.600> elements<00:01:36.229> that<00:01:36.979> attaches<00:01:37.580> it<00:01:37.880> all

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
rhythmic elements that attaches it all

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.350 
rhythmic elements that attaches it all
together<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.009> basically<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.159> start<00:01:40.819> off<00:01:40.970> with<00:01:41.330> a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
together so basically I start off with a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.600 
together so basically I start off with a
normal<00:01:42.640> Iman<00:01:43.640> or<00:01:43.670> scale

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.160 

so<00:01:52.300> here<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.630> have<00:01:53.050> just<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:55.300> basic<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.870> minor

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
so here I have just a the basic a minor

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.680 
so here I have just a the basic a minor
and<00:01:56.530> once<00:01:57.490> I<00:01:57.700> get<00:01:57.880> up<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.810> B<00:01:59.110> note<00:01:59.590> I<00:02:00.690> change

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and once I get up to the B note I change

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.820 
and once I get up to the B note I change
to<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:03.510> minor<00:02:04.510> harmonic<00:02:04.870> perfect<00:02:05.560> fifth

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
to the minor harmonic perfect fifth

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:13.870 
to the minor harmonic perfect fifth
scale<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:07.090> here<00:02:07.900> goes

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:29.690 

and<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:15.230> scale<00:02:15.470> basically<00:02:15.980> goes<00:02:16.340> like

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.530 

when<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> land<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> anodes<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.370> go<00:02:33.090> straight

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
when I land on the anodes I go straight

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.740 
when I land on the anodes I go straight
to<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> octave<00:02:40.099> just<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> vet<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.480> give<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
to the octave just to the vet to give it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500 
to the octave just to the vet to give it
some<00:02:42.900> sort<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.170> cool<00:02:43.980> rhythmic<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
some sort of cool rhythmic thing and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.120 
some sort of cool rhythmic thing and
then<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.720> go<00:02:46.050> back<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.660> minor<00:02:48.660> harmonic

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
then I go back to the minor harmonic

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.880 
then I go back to the minor harmonic
perfect<00:02:50.130> fifth<00:02:50.340> scale<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.989> time<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
perfect fifth scale but this time on the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.490 
perfect fifth scale but this time on the
E

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.640 

it's<00:02:59.500> like<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> CH

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.530 

I<00:03:04.849> decided<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.030> bit<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.299> interest<00:03:06.689> like

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.020 

and<00:03:09.750> basically<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.980> full-scale<00:03:11.549> rolls<00:03:11.819> like

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and basically the full-scale rolls like

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:30.340 
and basically the full-scale rolls like
this

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.140 

so<00:03:31.350> that's<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.740> full<00:03:32.070> scale<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:33.000> like

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
so that's the full scale and I just like

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.030 
so that's the full scale and I just like
this<00:03:34.050> snippet<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.960> I<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
this snippet out of it and I just to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.640 
this snippet out of it and I just to
close<00:03:38.310> off<00:03:38.610> with<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.420> riff<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.900> tail<00:03:40.320> is

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
close off with the riff the tail is

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.940 
close off with the riff the tail is
basically<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:42.350> groovy<00:03:43.350> sort<00:03:43.710> of<00:03:43.800> a

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
basically just a groovy sort of a

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
basically just a groovy sort of a
rhythmic<00:03:44.250> phrase<00:03:45.440> pentatonic<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:46.650> some

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
rhythmic phrase pentatonic with some

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.320 
rhythmic phrase pentatonic with some
chromatic<00:03:47.970> stuff<00:03:48.780> going<00:03:49.140> there<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:51.180> goes

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
chromatic stuff going there so it goes

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:02.290 
chromatic stuff going there so it goes
basically<00:03:51.780> like<00:03:51.960> this

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.380 

yeah<00:04:03.470> pretty<00:04:04.470> simple<00:04:04.860> just<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.520> pentatonic

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
yeah pretty simple just a pentatonic

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.120 
yeah pretty simple just a pentatonic
chromatic<00:04:07.670> combined<00:04:08.670> together<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.890> once<00:04:10.890> we

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
chromatic combined together and once we

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.480 
chromatic combined together and once we
combine<00:04:11.580> everything<00:04:11.610> together<00:04:12.090> we<00:04:12.480> get<00:04:13.200> the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
combine everything together we get the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.720 
combine everything together we get the
full<00:04:14.490> riff<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:16.410> thanks<00:04:16.890> for<00:04:17.010> watching<00:04:17.070> and

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
full riff so thanks for watching and

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.330 
full riff so thanks for watching and
hopefully<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.420> like<00:04:19.170> my<00:04:19.739> riff<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.220> my<00:04:20.280> music

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
hopefully you like my riff and my music

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.750 
hopefully you like my riff and my music
