hey<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.230> it's<00:00:01.260> dbv<00:00:02.040> big<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.490> I've<00:00:03.179> been<00:00:03.360> able

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hey guys it's dbv big and I've been able

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.240 
hey guys it's dbv big and I've been able
to<00:00:03.750> post<00:00:03.959> in<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.200> while<00:00:04.350> but<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:05.100> know<00:00:05.160> I've

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
to post in a while but you know I've

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.430 
to post in a while but you know I've
been<00:00:05.310> kind<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.670> busy<00:00:05.790> but<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.150> got<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> video<00:00:07.170> here

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
been kind of busy but I got a video here

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600 
been kind of busy but I got a video here
for<00:00:07.589> Rita<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.859> it's<00:00:07.980> gonna<00:00:08.069> be<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.250> short<00:00:08.460> one

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
for Rita that it's gonna be a short one

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.610 
for Rita that it's gonna be a short one
but<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.960> quick<00:00:10.139> look<00:00:10.410> at<00:00:10.500> my

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
but it's just a quick look at my

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.530 
but it's just a quick look at my
multiplier<00:00:11.150> it's<00:00:12.150> something<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
multiplier it's something that I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.720 
multiplier it's something that I
finished<00:00:12.870> pretty<00:00:13.860> long<00:00:14.070> ago<00:00:14.309> probably<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
finished pretty long ago probably a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.760 
finished pretty long ago probably a
couple<00:00:14.849> weeks<00:00:15.120> ago<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> just<00:00:16.470> haven't<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
couple weeks ago but I just haven't the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.609 
couple weeks ago but I just haven't the
time<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> post<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
time to post it so this is it it's a

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.640 
time to post it so this is it it's a
four-bit<00:00:20.279> times<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.789> bit<00:00:20.910> multiplier<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.650> if

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
four-bit times for bit multiplier and if

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
four-bit times for bit multiplier and if
you<00:00:22.769> know<00:00:22.890> anything<00:00:23.070> about<00:00:23.420> binary

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you know anything about binary

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.000 
you know anything about binary
multiplication<00:00:24.810> you'll<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.500> an<00:00:25.650> 8-bit

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
multiplication you'll get an 8-bit

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
multiplication you'll get an 8-bit
output<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.699> multiply<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.269> 4-bit

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
output when you multiply two 4-bit

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660 
output when you multiply two 4-bit
numbers<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.260> why<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:29.189> panel<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
numbers so that's why this panel is

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.939 
numbers so that's why this panel is
eight<00:00:29.910> long<00:00:30.289> there's<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.410> empty<00:00:31.679> hole<00:00:31.830> over

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
eight long there's an empty hole over

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.620 
eight long there's an empty hole over
there<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.369> i<00:00:32.550> plan<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.910> expand<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.480> out

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
there because i plan to expand this out

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.060 
there because i plan to expand this out
into<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> full<00:00:34.200> eight<00:00:34.410> bit<00:00:34.620> ALU<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:36.260> well<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
into a full eight bit ALU and well that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.709 
into a full eight bit ALU and well that
really<00:00:38.399> won't<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.700> part<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> ALU<00:00:39.450> because

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
really won't be part of the ALU because

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.770 
really won't be part of the ALU because
its<00:00:39.899> orbits<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.010> nonetheless<00:00:41.820> over<00:00:42.629> here

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
its orbits but nonetheless over here

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.139 
its orbits but nonetheless over here
we'll<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.079> eight<00:00:43.500> bits<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.030> end

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
we'll have eight bits and that can end

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.459 
we'll have eight bits and that can end
up<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> nine<00:00:45.629> bit<00:00:45.809> number<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> have

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
up to be a nine bit number so I have

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
up to be a nine bit number so I have
that<00:00:46.620> extra<00:00:46.860> hole<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.390> kind

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that extra hole down there just is kind

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.119 
that extra hole down there just is kind
of<00:00:48.780> reminder<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.300> account<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.539> later<00:00:51.719> on

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
of reminder to account for that later on

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.229 
of reminder to account for that later on
but<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.370> way<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> about<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
but in a way this is about the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.529 
but in a way this is about the
multiplier<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.320> let's<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.789> we'll

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
multiplier so let's just have look we'll

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.990 
multiplier so let's just have look we'll
do<00:00:57.629> 1<00:00:57.840> times<00:00:58.050> 1<00:00:58.579> which<00:00:59.579> yeah<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.600> obviously<00:01:01.230> one

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
do 1 times 1 which yeah is obviously one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:17.710 
do 1 times 1 which yeah is obviously one
so<00:01:03.080> one<00:01:04.129> yeah<00:01:05.129> 11<00:01:05.850> x<00:01:06.150> 1<00:01:08.119> we<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.920> 1<00:01:13.580> 11<00:01:14.580> 11<00:01:15.000> x<00:01:15.479> 1

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
so one yeah 11 x 1 we get to 1 11 11 x 1

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:26.899 
so one yeah 11 x 1 we get to 1 11 11 x 1
you<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> point<00:01:19.159> out<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.729> 15<00:01:21.450> x<00:01:21.869> 15<00:01:25.909> hello

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you get the point out to 15 x 15 hello

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
you get the point out to 15 x 15 hello
sheep<00:01:28.729> go<00:01:29.729> away<00:01:30.650> I'm<00:01:31.650> solved<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.200> 1

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sheep go away I'm solved so here we go 1

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.210 
sheep go away I'm solved so here we go 1
110<00:01:38.100> 00<00:01:39.030> 01<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.110> 15<00:01:40.470> m<00:01:40.619> 15<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.189> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
110 00 01 so that's 15 m 15 which is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.600 
110 00 01 so that's 15 m 15 which is
equal<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.579> 225<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.020> what<00:01:43.290> 1<00:01:43.500> 1<00:01:43.680> 1<00:01:43.890> 0<00:01:44.280> 0<00:01:44.369> 0

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
equal to 225 and that's what 1 1 1 0 0 0

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
equal to 225 and that's what 1 1 1 0 0 0
0<00:01:44.850> 1<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.509> equal<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.610> quick

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
0 1 is equal to so that's just a quick

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
0 1 is equal to so that's just a quick
look<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.180> multiply<00:01:48.630> era<00:01:49.280> hopefully<00:01:50.280> I'll

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
look at my multiply era hopefully I'll

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.069 
look at my multiply era hopefully I'll
have<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> video<00:01:50.820> coming<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.180> soon<00:01:51.479> we're<00:01:51.750> get

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
have a video coming up soon we're get

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.710 
have a video coming up soon we're get
in-depth<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.030> thing<00:01:54.270> works<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
in-depth with how this thing works and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.929 
in-depth with how this thing works and
if<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> whole

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
if you can see out there there's a whole

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.789 
if you can see out there there's a whole
mess<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> redstone

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
mess of redstone

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.989 
mess of redstone
creepy<00:01:59.799> music<00:01:59.829> okay<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:02.710> if<00:02:02.859> I<00:02:03.100> spawn

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
creepy music okay actually if I spawn

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.090 
creepy music okay actually if I spawn
here<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.450> don't<00:02:04.659> walk<00:02:04.840> over<00:02:05.170> there<00:02:05.319> half<00:02:05.979> of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
here and don't walk over there half of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980 
here and don't walk over there half of
it<00:02:06.280> won't<00:02:06.490> actually<00:02:06.729> render<00:02:07.299> that's<00:02:07.630> how<00:02:07.750> big

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
it won't actually render that's how big

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.070 
it won't actually render that's how big
it<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:10.090> huge<00:02:10.769> but<00:02:12.090> nonetheless<00:02:13.090> it's

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it is it's huge but nonetheless it's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.039
