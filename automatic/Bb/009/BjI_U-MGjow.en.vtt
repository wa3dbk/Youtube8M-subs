00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
want to line up your jump make sure you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.440 
want to line up your jump make sure you
jump<00:00:53.770> immediately<00:00:53.950> after<00:00:54.820> you're<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.239> air

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
jump immediately after you're in the air

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.510 
jump immediately after you're in the air
so<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.930> use<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.410> full<00:00:56.739> momentum<00:00:57.309> of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
so that you use that full momentum of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.479 
so that you use that full momentum of
the<00:00:57.880> balance<00:00:58.210> glide<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.890> now<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.460> have

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
the balance glide and now that you have

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.540 
the balance glide and now that you have
skipped<00:01:01.149> about<00:01:01.710> 3/4<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.860> entire<00:01:03.219> phase

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
skipped about 3/4 of the entire phase

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.700 
skipped about 3/4 of the entire phase
you<00:01:04.089> only<00:01:04.239> have<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.479> few<00:01:04.780> more<00:01:04.989> lamps<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.530> go

absolutely<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.709> safest<00:01:54.189> place<00:01:54.819> you<00:01:54.849> can<00:01:55.060> be

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
absolutely the safest place you can be

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.639 
absolutely the safest place you can be
because<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.630> gives<00:01:55.779> you<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.899> perfect<00:01:56.259> line<00:01:56.439> to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
because it gives you a perfect line to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.289 
because it gives you a perfect line to
turn<00:01:56.829> around<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.399> kill<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.819> yogurt<00:01:58.119> where

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
turn around and kill the yogurt where

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.139 
turn around and kill the yogurt where
I'm<00:01:58.419> pointing<00:01:58.569> right<00:01:59.200> now<00:01:59.729> when<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.849> ogre

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
I'm pointing right now when that ogre

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.529 
I'm pointing right now when that ogre
does<00:02:01.359> come<00:02:01.599> out<00:02:01.630> he<00:02:02.079> sometimes<00:02:02.560> does<00:02:02.799> glitch

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
does come out he sometimes does glitch

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.909 
does come out he sometimes does glitch
which<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.749> real<00:02:05.169> pain<00:02:05.349> in<00:02:05.499> the<00:02:05.529> butt<00:02:05.619> because

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919 
which is a real pain in the butt because

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.589 
which is a real pain in the butt because
then<00:02:06.369> all<00:02:06.520> sudden<00:02:06.909> he<00:02:06.999> can<00:02:07.119> appear<00:02:07.389> right

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
then all sudden he can appear right

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.589 
then all sudden he can appear right
where<00:02:07.749> that<00:02:07.869> heavy<00:02:08.050> ammo<00:02:08.349> is<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.789> level<00:02:10.149> 32

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
where that heavy ammo is as a level 32

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.080 
where that heavy ammo is as a level 32
he<00:02:10.869> only<00:02:11.290> takes<00:02:11.530> four<00:02:12.010> shots<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.550> head<00:02:12.670> and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
he only takes four shots to the head and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.260 
he only takes four shots to the head and
then<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.380> are<00:02:14.620> safe<00:02:14.980> sailing<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.150> way

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
then you are safe sailing all the way

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.130 
then you are safe sailing all the way
until<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.930> bridge<00:02:17.140> then<00:02:17.440> opens<00:02:17.830> up

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
until that bridge then opens up

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900 
until that bridge then opens up
and<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.920> are<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.520> next<00:02:19.730> phase

and then you are on to the next phase

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.600 
and then you are on to the next phase
you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.990> do<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.260> as<00:02:21.440> level<00:02:21.770> 30<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.190> don't<00:02:22.460> know

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
you can do this as level 30 I don't know

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.120 
you can do this as level 30 I don't know
the<00:02:22.730> exact<00:02:23.200> shots<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.410> takes<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.740> kill<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
the exact shots it takes to kill the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.610 
the exact shots it takes to kill the
ogre<00:02:25.820> but<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.750> one<00:02:26.990> ocher<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.440> your

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
ogre but you know that one ocher is your

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.080 
ogre but you know that one ocher is your
only<00:02:27.980> threat<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.580> going<00:02:29.360> across<00:02:29.570> there<00:02:29.900> and

showing<00:03:04.130> more<00:03:04.280> how<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> jump<00:03:04.880> across<00:03:05.030> I'm<00:03:05.360> not

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
showing more how to jump across I'm not

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.199 
showing more how to jump across I'm not
gonna<00:03:05.599> be<00:03:06.349> killing<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.250> ogres<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:07.910> showing

gonna be killing the ogres or showing
any<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.599> since<00:03:08.810> that's<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.230> pretty<00:03:09.560> easy

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
any of that since that's a pretty easy

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.580 
any of that since that's a pretty easy
process<00:03:10.810> you're<00:03:11.810> gonna<00:03:11.900> want<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.170> go<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.319> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
process you're gonna want to go to the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.740 
process you're gonna want to go to the
ledge<00:03:12.830> that's<00:03:13.280> all<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.849> way<00:03:13.970> against<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
ledge that's all the way against the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.930 
ledge that's all the way against the
edge<00:03:14.900> here<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:15.380> then<00:03:16.220> you're<00:03:16.370> going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.760> look

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
edge here and then you're going to look

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.220 
edge here and then you're going to look
at<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> marker<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.840> like<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> little

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
at a marker here it's like a little

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.410 
at a marker here it's like a little
design<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.950> that's<00:03:19.610> your<00:03:19.910> marker<00:03:20.180> where<00:03:20.330> you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
design and that's your marker where you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.180 
design and that's your marker where you
want<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.660> jump<00:03:20.870> go<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.230> your<00:03:21.410> max<00:03:21.620> height<00:03:21.890> here

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
want to jump go to your max height here

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.490 
want to jump go to your max height here
and<00:03:22.640> start<00:03:22.880> swinging<00:03:23.180> away<00:03:23.329> like<00:03:23.630> crazy<00:03:23.750> if

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
and start swinging away like crazy if

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.949 
and start swinging away like crazy if
you<00:03:24.769> cut<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.160> corner<00:03:25.549> too<00:03:25.880> quickly<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.720> will

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
you cut that corner too quickly you will

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.720 
you cut that corner too quickly you will
hit<00:03:27.200> an<00:03:27.319> invisible<00:03:27.709> wall<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.280> will<00:03:28.489> die

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
hit an invisible wall and you will die

come across kill the gatekeepers and
yogurt<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.430> job<00:03:32.120> well<00:03:32.299> done<00:03:32.470> next<00:03:33.470> part<00:03:33.769> is

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
yogurt and job well done next part is

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.770 
yogurt and job well done next part is
the<00:03:33.980> speed<00:03:34.489> chest<00:03:34.819> with<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.090> two<00:03:35.239> Shriekers

the speed chest with the two Shriekers

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.259 
the speed chest with the two Shriekers
there's<00:03:36.410> really<00:03:36.680> no<00:03:36.980> need<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.790> do<00:03:38.120> any

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
there's really no need to do any

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.550 
there's really no need to do any
