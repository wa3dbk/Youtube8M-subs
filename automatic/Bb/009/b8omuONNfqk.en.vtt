00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and everything so I'm not sure but I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.269 
and everything so I'm not sure but I
know<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.500> people<00:00:31.769> refer<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> them

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279

know that a lot of people refer to them
as<00:00:32.399> suede<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.149> video<00:00:33.390> let's<00:00:33.690> just

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
as suede so for this video let's just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
as suede so for this video let's just
say<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.620> ones<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.160> are<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.550> sweaty

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
say the ones on the right are the sweaty

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
say the ones on the right are the sweaty
kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> versions<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.320> classic<00:00:37.680> ones<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
ones on the left are the leather ones so

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.160 
ones on the left are the leather ones so
the<00:00:41.969> reason<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.629> two<00:00:42.809> pairs<00:00:43.079> of

boots<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.620> leather<00:03:05.890> ones<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.400> slightly

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
boots is the leather ones are slightly

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.130 
boots is the leather ones are slightly
taller<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.510> there's<00:03:07.780> not<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.930> lot<00:03:07.990> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
taller and there's not a lot of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.360 
taller and there's not a lot of
information<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.710> had<00:03:08.860> about<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.130> level<00:03:09.310> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
information to be had about the level of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.830 
information to be had about the level of
the<00:03:09.520> line<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.880> not<00:03:09.910> sure<00:03:10.240> if<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:10.450> still<00:03:10.630> sell

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
the line I'm not sure if they still sell

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.570 
the line I'm not sure if they still sell
them<00:03:10.990> they<00:03:11.350> might<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.800> been<00:03:11.980> discontinued

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
them they might have been discontinued

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.030 
them they might have been discontinued
because<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.570> can't<00:03:13.810> find<00:03:13.960> in<00:03:14.170> many<00:03:14.350> places<00:03:14.620> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
because I can't find in many places and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.860 
because I can't find in many places and
I<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.370> hardly<00:03:15.490> find<00:03:15.760> any<00:03:15.940> reviews<00:03:16.540> at<00:03:16.660> all

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
I can hardly find any reviews at all

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.440 
I can hardly find any reviews at all
when<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:17.890> was<00:03:18.070> looking<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.550> them<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:19.330> are

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
when I was looking for them but they are

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.580 
when I was looking for them but they are
slightly<00:03:19.600> taller<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:19.990> don't<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.320> if<00:03:20.410> that's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
slightly taller I don't know if that's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.020 
slightly taller I don't know if that's
just<00:03:20.650> because<00:03:20.830> I've<00:03:21.040> got<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.190> size<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.580> because

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
just because I've got a size up because

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.820 
just because I've got a size up because
I'm<00:03:22.270> sure<00:03:22.510> I'm<00:03:22.720> assuming<00:03:23.080> they<00:03:23.140> can't<00:03:23.380> be<00:03:23.560> kind

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
I'm sure I'm assuming they can't be kind

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.770 
I'm sure I'm assuming they can't be kind
of<00:03:23.920> that's<00:03:24.400> more<00:03:24.610> than<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> centimeter<00:03:25.210> they

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
of that's more than a centimeter they

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.750 
of that's more than a centimeter they
can't<00:03:26.020> be<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.350> centimeter<00:03:26.860> taller<00:03:27.070> per<00:03:27.430> size

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
can't be a centimeter taller per size

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
can't be a centimeter taller per size
because<00:03:28.210> then<00:03:28.360> they're<00:03:28.510> getting<00:03:28.620> quite<00:03:29.620> tall

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
because then they're getting quite tall

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.590 
because then they're getting quite tall
and<00:03:30.280> then<00:03:30.370> they<00:03:30.490> do<00:03:30.550> do<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> tall<00:03:31.180> boots<00:03:31.420> as

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
and then they do do the tall boots as

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
and then they do do the tall boots as
well<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:31.930> I'm<00:03:32.050> kind<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.380> thinking<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.980> might<00:03:33.370> be

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
well so I'm kind of thinking it might be

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.600 
well so I'm kind of thinking it might be
the<00:03:34.000> leather<00:03:34.270> variation<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:36.250> just<00:03:36.550> a

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
the leather variation that is just a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.310 
the leather variation that is just a
little<00:03:36.820> bit<00:03:36.940> taller<00:03:37.210> another<00:03:37.990> difference

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
little bit taller another difference

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.110 
little bit taller another difference
that<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.530> noticed<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.250> immediately<00:03:39.910> when<00:03:40.090> I

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that I noticed and immediately when I

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.030 
that I noticed and immediately when I
put<00:03:40.270> my<00:03:40.300> foot<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.840> leather<00:03:41.020> boot<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.470> that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
put my foot in the leather boot is that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.560 
put my foot in the leather boot is that
the<00:03:42.130> hole<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.580> your<00:03:42.730> foot<00:03:42.880> is<00:03:43.030> much<00:03:43.300> much

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
the hole for your foot is much much

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.210 
the hole for your foot is much much
bigger<00:03:43.780> now<00:03:44.380> they're<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.710> little<00:03:44.920> bit<00:03:45.010> tighter

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
bigger now they're a little bit tighter

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.320 
bigger now they're a little bit tighter
because<00:03:45.400> they<00:03:45.640> are<00:03:45.760> leather<00:03:45.940> there's<00:03:46.120> not<00:03:46.270> as

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
because they are leather there's not as

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.940 
because they are leather there's not as
much<00:03:46.450> give<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.930> would<00:03:47.110> imagine<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.710> will

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
much give I would imagine that they will

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.650 
much give I would imagine that they will
kind<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.730> get<00:03:48.850> softer<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:49.390> they'll<00:03:49.480> have<00:03:49.630> a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
kind of get softer and they'll have a

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.290 
kind of get softer and they'll have a
little<00:03:49.810> bit<00:03:49.990> of<00:03:50.110> give<00:03:50.740> over<00:03:51.190> time<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.210> was

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
little bit of give over time but it was

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.840 
little bit of give over time but it was
a<00:03:52.360> little<00:03:52.480> bit<00:03:52.600> difficult<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.870> get<00:03:52.960> my<00:03:53.080> foot<00:03:53.290> in

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
a little bit difficult to get my foot in

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.520 
a little bit difficult to get my foot in
but<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.030> hole<00:03:55.210> that<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.870> actually<00:03:56.170> put<00:03:56.350> your

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
but the hole that you actually put your

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.740 
but the hole that you actually put your
foot<00:03:56.740> in<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.160> hole<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.700> will<00:03:57.850> kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.150> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
foot in the hole that will kind of the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.440 
foot in the hole that will kind of the
the<00:03:59.290> top<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.980> boot<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.850> surrounds<00:04:01.270> your

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
the top of the boot that surrounds your

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.620 
the top of the boot that surrounds your
cut<00:04:02.260> off<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.950> lot<00:04:03.340> larger<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.240> I<00:04:04.330> don't<00:04:04.390> know

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
cut off is a lot larger and I don't know

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.850 
cut off is a lot larger and I don't know
again<00:04:04.870> if<00:04:05.020> this<00:04:05.140> is<00:04:05.290> something<00:04:05.590> that's<00:04:05.680> the

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
again if this is something that's the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.830 
again if this is something that's the
difference<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.490> style<00:04:06.790> or<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.150> difference<00:04:07.720> in

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
difference in style or a difference in

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.199 
difference in style or a difference in
size<00:04:08.050> but<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.860> difference<00:04:09.340> seems<00:04:09.580> too<00:04:09.970> large

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
size but the difference seems too large

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.720 
size but the difference seems too large
for<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.660> just<00:04:10.870> be<00:04:11.050> one<00:04:11.830> size<00:04:12.130> up<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:12.580> is

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
for it to just be one size up this is

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.770 
for it to just be one size up this is
how<00:04:12.760> much<00:04:12.970> bigger<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.330> is<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:13.630> thought

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
how much bigger it is I just thought

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.420 
how much bigger it is I just thought
that<00:04:13.959> was<00:04:14.050> worth<00:04:14.170> mentioning<00:04:14.650> because<00:04:14.770> when<00:04:15.400> I

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
that was worth mentioning because when I

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.830 
that was worth mentioning because when I
initially<00:04:15.700> put<00:04:15.970> my<00:04:16.120> foot<00:04:16.299> into<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.600> boot<00:04:16.720> I

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
initially put my foot into the boot I

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.720 
initially put my foot into the boot I
thought<00:04:17.049> ooh<00:04:17.230> I<00:04:17.530> probably<00:04:18.070> need<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.430> go<00:04:18.520> a<00:04:18.549> size

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
thought ooh I probably need to go a size

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.879 
thought ooh I probably need to go a size
down<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.239> these<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.690> I've<00:04:20.590> just

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
down in these and I've just

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.589 
down in these and I've just
to<00:04:21.069> keep<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.459> ones<00:04:21.609> in<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.819> size<00:04:21.969> 5<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.539> are

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
to keep the ones in the size 5 that are

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.779 
to keep the ones in the size 5 that are
leather<00:04:22.870> because<00:04:23.409> generally<00:04:24.219> I<00:04:24.400> buy<00:04:24.639> them

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
leather because generally I buy them

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.760 
leather because generally I buy them
with<00:04:24.969> kind<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.240> thick<00:04:25.419> socks<00:04:25.719> and<00:04:26.259> in<00:04:26.349> fact<00:04:26.560> I

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
with kind of thick socks and in fact I

that they collapse in the heel where
it's<00:04:48.490> Oaks<00:04:48.669> take<00:04:48.879> a<00:04:48.909> lot<00:04:49.150> longer<00:04:49.300> they<00:04:49.539> do

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
it's Oaks take a lot longer they do

suppose depending on how you wear them
but<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.740> know<00:04:53.800> minded<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.580> but<00:04:55.330> they<00:04:55.389> take<00:04:55.539> a

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
but I know minded and but they take a

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.240 
but I know minded and but they take a
lot<00:04:55.840> longer<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.229> do<00:04:56.469> that<00:04:56.650> much<00:04:56.860> because<00:04:57.009> they

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
lot longer to do that much because they

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.670 
lot longer to do that much because they
are<00:04:57.279> much<00:04:58.090> much<00:04:58.300> firmer<00:04:58.689> I<00:04:59.020> mean<00:04:59.289> if<00:04:59.379> you<00:04:59.469> see

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
are much much firmer I mean if you see

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.629 
are much much firmer I mean if you see
with<00:04:59.860> this<00:04:59.979> one<00:05:00.479> if<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.629> tap<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:03.340> can<00:05:03.490> hear

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
with this one if I tap this you can hear

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.119 
with this one if I tap this you can hear
something<00:05:03.819> for<00:05:04.060> they<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.180> tap<00:05:04.389> this<00:05:05.129> it's

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
something for they to tap this it's

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:13.350 
something for they to tap this it's
obviously<00:05:08.610> firmer<00:05:10.680> where<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.770> this<00:05:12.180> this<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.330> a

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
obviously firmer where is this this is a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700 
obviously firmer where is this this is a
very<00:05:13.599> very<00:05:13.779> strange<00:05:14.110> thing<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.349> be<00:05:14.469> doing<00:05:14.650> in

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
very very strange thing to be doing in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.610 
very very strange thing to be doing in
the<00:05:14.770> video<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.039> understand<00:05:16.199> its<00:05:17.199> kind<00:05:17.529> of

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
the video I understand its kind of

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.559 
the video I understand its kind of
firmer<00:05:17.889> all<00:05:18.159> over<00:05:18.580> it's<00:05:18.969> definitely<00:05:19.419> more

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
firmer all over it's definitely more

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.540 
firmer all over it's definitely more
reinforced<00:05:20.139> here<00:05:20.409> but<00:05:20.770> generally<00:05:21.009> the<00:05:21.310> boots

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
reinforced here but generally the boots

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.629 
reinforced here but generally the boots
all<00:05:21.819> over<00:05:22.449> is<00:05:22.659> a<00:05:22.689> lot<00:05:23.020> firmer<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.129> I<00:05:24.189> feel<00:05:24.430> like

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
all over is a lot firmer and I feel like

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.950 
all over is a lot firmer and I feel like
they<00:05:24.849> kind<00:05:24.939> of<00:05:25.029> hold<00:05:25.300> up<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:25.629> much<00:05:25.689> better

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
they kind of hold up so much better

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.510 
they kind of hold up so much better
because<00:05:26.229> of<00:05:26.259> that<00:05:26.379> I<00:05:26.529> mean<00:05:26.650> even<00:05:27.250> as<00:05:27.370> they

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
because of that I mean even as they

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.619 
because of that I mean even as they
stand<00:05:27.789> right<00:05:28.029> hip<00:05:28.270> right<00:05:28.509> here<00:05:28.779> I<00:05:28.839> can<00:05:29.110> kind<00:05:29.289> of

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
stand right hip right here I can kind of

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.579 
stand right hip right here I can kind of
see<00:05:31.629> I<00:05:31.659> don't<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.960> if<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.080> can<00:05:32.229> tell<00:05:32.409> from

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
that but the one on the left is kind of

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.659

slouchy<00:05:35.229> a<00:05:35.500> little<00:05:35.710> bit<00:05:35.800> already<00:05:36.009> or<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.610> the

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.670 
straight and I feel like they're going
to<00:05:40.449> be<00:05:40.509> smoother<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.050> they're<00:05:41.319> not<00:05:41.409> going<00:05:41.620> to

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.860 
feels a little bit more like a boot it's
a<00:06:11.889> little<00:06:12.099> bit<00:06:12.189> tighter<00:06:12.490> around<00:06:12.969> the<00:06:13.569> top<00:06:13.750> of

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
a little bit tighter around the top of

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.350 
a little bit tighter around the top of
my<00:06:13.990> foot<00:06:14.259> and<00:06:14.560> but<00:06:15.310> at<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.669> same<00:06:15.849> time<00:06:16.089> it's

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
my foot and but at the same time it's

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.179 
my foot and but at the same time it's
not<00:06:16.539> really<00:06:16.839> it's<00:06:17.319> not<00:06:17.409> uncomfortable<00:06:17.889> it's

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
not really it's not uncomfortable it's

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.850 
not really it's not uncomfortable it's
still<00:06:18.339> very<00:06:18.490> comfortable<00:06:18.699> for<00:06:19.509> a<00:06:19.569> boot<00:06:19.779> and<00:06:20.169> I

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
still very comfortable for a boot and I

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.309 
still very comfortable for a boot and I
feel<00:06:21.189> like<00:06:21.370> they<00:06:21.490> look<00:06:21.779> just<00:06:22.779> as<00:06:22.930> good<00:06:23.080> as<00:06:23.199> each

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
feel like they look just as good as each

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.200 
feel like they look just as good as each
other<00:06:23.439> whereas<00:06:23.770> this<00:06:23.889> one<00:06:24.069> obviously

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
other whereas this one obviously

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.969 
other whereas this one obviously
obviously<00:06:25.210> I<00:06:25.689> have<00:06:26.110> in<00:06:26.289> mind<00:06:26.500> that<00:06:26.710> this<00:06:26.830> one

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
obviously I have in mind that this one

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.159 
obviously I have in mind that this one
is<00:06:27.069> costing<00:06:27.430> me<00:06:27.460> half<00:06:27.669> the<00:06:27.699> price<00:06:28.029> and<00:06:28.360> so

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
is costing me half the price and so

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.060 
is costing me half the price and so
that's<00:06:29.349> definitely<00:06:29.409> some

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
that's definitely some

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.010 
that's definitely some
I'm<00:06:30.250> taking<00:06:30.640> into<00:06:30.820> consideration<00:06:30.990> but<00:06:31.990> I

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
I'm taking into consideration but I

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.480 
I'm taking into consideration but I
still<00:06:32.260> think<00:06:32.530> that<00:06:32.590> when<00:06:32.920> they<00:06:33.010> vote<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.340> same

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
still think that when they vote the same

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.460 
still think that when they vote the same
price<00:06:33.790> I<00:06:34.180> would<00:06:34.570> go<00:06:34.660> to<00:06:34.720> the<00:06:34.900> leathery<00:06:35.140> looking

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
price I would go to the leathery looking

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.550 
price I would go to the leathery looking
one<00:06:35.820> as<00:06:36.820> opposed<00:06:37.540> to<00:06:37.630> this<00:06:37.810> weighty<00:06:38.020> one<00:06:38.290> so

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
one as opposed to this weighty one so
