 mainly clearly for being a 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 vehicle zero emission is to be a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.860
 fully green vehicle committed

 with the environment but that's not 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.430
 everything in terms of driving is a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 absolute driving 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.110
 simple and fun is a vehicle that 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.250
 Due to its dimensions, it is ideal for 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 big cities with a lot 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.790
 congestion is a vehicle that does not 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.980
 has peak and plate for example in the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 cities of bogotá and medellín in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.760
 where conventional car park to a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.920
 three crises come in and it's a vehicle 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 finally ideal for these cities of 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.530
 great congestion the third great 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.020
 advantage of its cost of use if 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.120
 one does a financial analysis of 20 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.890
 thousand kilometers of use that is the use 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.540
 Approximately two years of a client 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.030
 medium in colombia the client will be 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.370
 saving between maintenance and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.530
 cost of energy 4 million pesos 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.620
 that is 10 percent of the value of the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.620
 vehicle 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.320

 inside the twist and with some controls 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.020
 simple 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.870
 we have on this side the option of 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.030
 selection of speeds is not to say 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.340
 we have gear lever but 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.920
 simply with a button we can 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.260
 select drive to forward the network 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.730
 for reverse and neutral for neutral in the 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.710
 parking case we have an address 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.860
 normal is not assisted 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.400
 We have airbag equipped with airbag for 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.080
 the protection of the driver in the box 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.840
 instruments we can observe that it is 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.910
 simple digital basically the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.460
 normal functions of a vehicle 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.600
 electric the state of charge the 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.140
 speed and battery autonomy 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.390
 some witnesses that are the neutral one of 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.390
 gaulle stop 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.640
 service and brake to turn on the 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.610
 vehicle only we have to insert 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.979
 the key 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.979
 and give it to press the brake pedal 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.039
 and we are not told in the go witness 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.039
 in the table instruments that the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:42.860
 vehicle is already active for the start 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:46.740
 we select drive and with this we count 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.830
 we uncouple the handbrake and it's 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.020
 ready to start the march the question 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.860
 is how it charges itself because basically it 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.990
 charge with 220 volts with a steve with 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.990
 an estimated hours of three hours and 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.250
 average for the total charge of the battery 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.710
 we just lift the shutter and the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.860
 vehicle contains the cable and the socket 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.409
 to have a direct shot and you can 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.120
 charge at home in your office and in 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.699
 any part where you have available 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.530
 a 220 volt outlet the structure of 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.919
 the suspension because basically it 's kind 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.009
 mcpherson coil springs and 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.280
 we have additional to that four brakes 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.159
 discs the handle of the door is very 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.600
 easy to operate simply it 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.900
 we act 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.370
 for the top and the door 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.890
 just get up to be able 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.670
 access from inside the vehicle 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:49.260
 twizy vehicle equips an electric motor 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:51.990
 of 17 horses and with a torque of 57 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.800
 newton-meter the electric motor is 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.910
 located in the back of the vehicle 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.920
 vehicle your bike has a 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.860
 maximum speed of 80 kilometers per 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.840
 hour and a range between 50 and 80 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.620
 kilometers depending on the form of 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.610
 use with this friends I say goodbye 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.670
 soon you will be able to see it in the streets 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.830
 of colombia and this is the future of the 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.940
 sustainable mobility that reindeer proposes 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.940
