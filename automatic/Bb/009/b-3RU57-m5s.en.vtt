00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.750
 I finish another week on hot land 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.999
 in Michoacán under the supervision of 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.650
 federal forces few incidents of 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.570
 severity were recorded in this week 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.219
 the inhabitants of the region try 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.740
 completely resume your daily life 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.199
 however there are some who still see 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.720
 far that possibility come with us to see 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.609
 these testimonies 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.590
 during the last four weeks 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.939
 Erandi and Pamela sixth year students 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.949
 of primary originating from parácuaro 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.809
 michoacán study and perform tasks 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.730
 from home because they have not 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.050
 returned to the classrooms, considering that 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.570
 there are no safety conditions 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.730
 that there have been many meetings that 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.760
 moms say they do not agree though 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.680
 there are classes only go pick 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.350
 tasks and Mondays going to that 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.860
 qualify and give more homework assignments or 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.480
 I wear them out and they leave me more 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.309
 teenagers already want to return to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.080
 classes are concerned that topics remain 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.030
 pending and delay your instruction 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.040
 academic mainly because they are 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.659
 coming back as primary 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.540
 it's not the same because I do not understand 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.950
 already a lot to things because when there was 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 that the tasks already made me more 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.520
 easy because they did not explain themselves anymore and 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.229
 as nothing else is an hour no no 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560
 can also explain and it's not the same 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.630
 how to be going daily to classes and 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.360
 I'm not comfortable without jr without going to the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.460
 school is very complicated the teacher 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.670
 before we do one thing 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.799
 it explains does not explain everything then 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 we are not explaining mothers of 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.670
 family like pearl from home help 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 your children to perform the tasks but 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.650
 recognizes that it has been complicated 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.350
 supporting them makes it harder for me because 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.159
 this I do not have 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.560
 the ability to teach it in preschool 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.450
