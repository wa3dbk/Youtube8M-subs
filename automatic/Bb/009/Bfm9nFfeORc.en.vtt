00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.710

 this season is the orange very very 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.820
 important this color is much much 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.730
 energy a lot of joy frees you from everything 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.340
 negative cares or is it also youth 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.020
 As it looks, the dress is in lace that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.300
 It is also in trend but the most 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.740
 important have caused you to die 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.200
 free of all the negative that does not 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.330
 we want not a touch of that our 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.670
 of that nothing and also look before you 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 forget me personal success if you're 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.640
 looking for that in your life is basically or 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.620
 be indispensable, I like that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.080
 now we are seeing a color that is 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 as brown does not look see we always think 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.209
 that the brown anna is opaque that does not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.239
 gives happiness and we are wrong is the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.180
 color of mother earth is fertility or 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.940
 be all that you have to reflect if you do not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.340
 like the color brown in all wardrobe 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.480
 fire opt for the pattern as we see 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.190
 that is also very good I have a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.170
 money here with white as we are 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 seeing and is that really as one is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.310
 you saw is how the morning feels like and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.720
 the brown is also very important to the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.760
 Stability time of your decisions 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.819
 you know we got up and what do I do today 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.470
 who I go out with and what work I want that 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.239
 it is very important to obtain this color if 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.069
 they are a bit unstable in their decision 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.630
 today etb but as there are colors that 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.340
 we must choose when 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.710
 to dress to feel good there 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.770
 ones that we should we should avoid and say 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.290
 not this not what are the grays good 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.540
 you have to avoid it the black ones the blue ones 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.640
 celestial would be surprised that the violet 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.470
 is one of the least that energy is 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.570
 versatile and we are always wrong with 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.520
 that's because they have to cover in the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.770
 black I feel good and the end that are 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.750
 sad is like you use them too 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.670
 to disguise sometimes but it does not give you that 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.710
 energy that we need it seems that the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.500
 violet is like the negative side of 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.570
 the palette and just passivity us 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.520
 it does not give us like the energy we seek 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.060
 more recollection what we want is that 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.010
 energy joy clear I really like you 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.780
 you come in green because you want to attract the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.730
 money renew all that part I do not know 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.560
 They wear the green is like the year we are going to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.200
 be here of simple reds for love 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.930
 and then green for money, because I 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
 this day I want to change colors 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.750
 blouse because I want to be adjusted that 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.920

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.250
 especially on this Friday we added 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.940
 Pink color 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.940
 please neither the violet 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.100
 Orange yellow 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.870
 so that green lasts me yes because what 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.700
 you have to pay someone or reins 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.280
