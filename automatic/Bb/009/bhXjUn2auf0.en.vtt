00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
back to the boat blesser is put some

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
back to the boat blesser is put some
thicker-gauge<00:00:18.660> wiring<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.520> for<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> battery

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
thicker-gauge wiring in for the battery

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.689 
thicker-gauge wiring in for the battery
and<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.350> rated<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.949> don't<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.550> can

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and this is rated I don't know you can

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
and this is rated I don't know you can
see<00:00:24.380> now<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.439> were<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.539> 600

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
see now you were going to see that 600

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
see now you were going to see that 600
volts<00:00:28.760> 105<00:00:29.760> degree<00:00:30.179> Celsius<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> mean<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
volts 105 degree Celsius so I mean this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
volts 105 degree Celsius so I mean this
is<00:00:32.040> more<00:00:32.399> than<00:00:32.550> sufficient<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.540> capable

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is more than sufficient this capable

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.990 
is more than sufficient this capable
wormy<00:00:34.230> looks<00:00:34.500> more<00:00:34.770> than<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.880> I've

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
wormy looks more than it is because I've

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
wormy looks more than it is because I've
got<00:00:36.210> huge<00:00:36.450> hands<00:00:38.809> one<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.140> noticed<00:00:40.350> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
got huge hands one thing I've noticed is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
got huge hands one thing I've noticed is
the<00:00:40.739> battery<00:00:41.070> hasn't<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.340> three<00:00:41.550> lights<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the battery hasn't got three lights on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.330 
the battery hasn't got three lights on
it<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.809> very<00:00:42.899> sunny<00:00:43.350> earlier<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.829> said<00:00:44.160> about

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it was very sunny earlier on said about

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
it was very sunny earlier on said about
and<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.700> checked<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.450> twelve

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and I checked it something like twelve

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
and I checked it something like twelve
point<00:00:46.050> nine<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.530> something<00:00:46.800> or<00:00:46.950> twelve<00:00:47.190> point

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
point nine or something or twelve point

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
point nine or something or twelve point
seven<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.329> for<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> charge<00:00:49.050> ever<00:00:49.620> with

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
seven which is for the charge ever with

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
seven which is for the charge ever with
the<00:00:49.980> solar<00:00:50.219> panel<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> should<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.149> at

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the solar panel it should be more at

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.139 
the solar panel it should be more at
thirteen<00:00:51.710> point<00:00:52.710> five<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.430> fourteen<00:00:53.879> because

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
thirteen point five to fourteen because

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
thirteen point five to fourteen because
I<00:00:54.360> haven't<00:00:54.629> been<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.260> three<00:00:55.500> days<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.039> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I haven't been on it for three days so I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
I haven't been on it for three days so I
mean<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.399> should<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.640> put<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.420> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
mean it should have put it back in I do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
mean it should have put it back in I do
and<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> 5<00:00:58.530> watt<00:00:58.710> panel<00:00:59.100> though<00:00:59.250> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and you have a 5 watt panel though so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
and you have a 5 watt panel though so
I'm<00:00:59.640> wondering<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.289> anything<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.710> do

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I'm wondering if that has anything to do

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.039 
I'm wondering if that has anything to do
that<00:01:02.219> now<00:01:02.579> I've<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> bigger<00:01:03.059> battery<00:01:06.020> yeah

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that now I've got a bigger battery yeah

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
that now I've got a bigger battery yeah
still<00:01:08.040> waiting<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.729> transportation<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
still waiting on transportation to the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.170 
still waiting on transportation to the
marina<00:01:10.250> can't<00:01:11.250> wait<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.689> shall<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
marina can't wait and then I shall be

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
marina can't wait and then I shall be
living<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.770> as<00:01:16.770> she<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> why<00:01:17.460> ID<00:01:17.790> row<00:01:19.189> so

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
living on that as she is why ID row so

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.050 
living on that as she is why ID row so
it<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.640> primitive<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.390> begin<00:01:21.630> with

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
it will be very primitive to begin with

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
it will be very primitive to begin with
I've<00:01:24.060> been<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.689> I've<00:01:24.840> said<00:01:25.020> before<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.409> will

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I've been like I've said before I will

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
I've been like I've said before I will
make<00:01:25.770> me<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.100> rounded<00:01:26.520> character<00:01:30.229> camera

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
make me more rounded character camera

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
make me more rounded character camera
let<00:01:31.409> me<00:01:31.530> record<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> battery's<00:01:32.610> dead

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
let me record because the battery's dead

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.520 
let me record because the battery's dead
why<00:01:33.659> I've<00:01:33.720> done<00:01:33.960> today

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
why I've done today

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
like I said his change of wiring I

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.039 
like I said his change of wiring I
pumped<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> water<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:41.720> I'll<00:01:42.720> show<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
pumped out the water and I'll show you

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.720 
pumped out the water and I'll show you
now

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730

don't<00:01:50.730> we<00:01:52.520> put<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:53.690> battery<00:01:54.690> terminals<00:01:55.110> some

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
don't we put some battery terminals some

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.500 
don't we put some battery terminals some
proper<00:01:56.310> ones<00:01:56.490> rather<00:01:56.670> than<00:01:56.910> these<00:01:57.000> profitable

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
proper ones rather than these profitable

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.840 
proper ones rather than these profitable
crocodile<00:01:58.110> clips<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:59.250> I've<00:01:59.430> done<00:01:59.670> some

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
crocodile clips and I've done some

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.110 
crocodile clips and I've done some
proper<00:02:00.180> keep<00:02:00.360> our<00:02:00.540> wiring<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:03.060> the

proper keep our wiring for the for the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.430 
proper keep our wiring for the for the
connectors<00:02:03.540> anyway<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:03.870> done<00:02:04.080> some<00:02:04.260> high

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
connectors anyway I've done some high

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.100 
connectors anyway I've done some high
connectors<00:02:05.030> spider<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.210> I'm<00:02:06.330> back<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.780> say

connectors spider if I'm back at we say

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.280 
connectors spider if I'm back at we say
that<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.380> short<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:11.690> we<00:02:12.690> are<00:02:12.840> getting<00:02:12.990> there

you<00:02:47.360> got<00:02:48.360> my<00:02:48.450> charge<00:02:48.660> controller<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.380> is

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
you got my charge controller which is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.330 
you got my charge controller which is
very<00:02:49.770> basic<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:51.180> will<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.630> now

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
very basic which will do for now

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
all that talk about is green energy

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.629 
all that talk about is green energy
there's<00:04:15.440> I'm<00:04:15.560> quite<00:04:15.769> passionate<00:04:15.950> about<00:04:16.190> solar

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
there's I'm quite passionate about solar

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.949 
there's I'm quite passionate about solar
and<00:04:17.239> wind<00:04:17.979> wind<00:04:18.979> so<00:04:19.250> much<00:04:19.430> around<00:04:20.359> here<00:04:20.750> we've

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
and wind wind so much around here we've

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.810 
and wind wind so much around here we've
either<00:04:21.139> got<00:04:21.320> loads<00:04:21.709> or<00:04:22.070> none<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.880> today<00:04:24.820> it's

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
either got loads or none and today it's

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.340 
either got loads or none and today it's
the<00:04:25.970> sunniest<00:04:26.419> part<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.960> UK<00:04:27.320> I

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the sunniest part of the UK I

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.020 
the sunniest part of the UK I
devastating<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.310> that's<00:04:28.520> probably<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.880> way

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
devastating so that's probably the way

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.620 
devastating so that's probably the way
to<00:04:29.060> go<00:04:29.210> for<00:04:29.570> me<00:04:30.190> but<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.220> will<00:04:31.310> be<00:04:31.520> getting<00:04:31.700> sort

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
to go for me but I will be getting sort

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.170 
to go for me but I will be getting sort
of<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:33.370> 453<00:04:34.370> 3<00:04:35.060> about<00:04:35.870> 350<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.500> 450<00:04:37.180> somewhere

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
of a 453 3 about 350 to 450 somewhere

will<00:05:34.340> be<00:05:34.460> moved<00:05:34.729> I'm<00:05:35.030> not<00:05:35.180> sure<00:05:35.330> where<00:05:35.539> yet<00:05:35.750> the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
will be moved I'm not sure where yet the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.960 
will be moved I'm not sure where yet the
amorphous<00:05:36.710> panel<00:05:37.130> will<00:05:37.220> definitely<00:05:37.610> be<00:05:37.760> moved

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
amorphous panel will definitely be moved

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.090 
amorphous panel will definitely be moved
because<00:05:38.270> where<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.750> amorphous<00:05:39.050> panel<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.650> on

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
because where the amorphous panel is on

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.090 
because where the amorphous panel is on
top<00:05:40.280> of<00:05:40.400> that<00:05:40.460> hatch<00:05:41.350> I'm<00:05:42.350> going<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.590> have<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.740> 50
