00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
up here and I found this uh this little

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.760 
up here and I found this uh this little
cave<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:39.170> take<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> peek

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
cave right up here take a peek

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.949 
cave right up here take a peek
doesn't<00:01:41.670> look<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.940> he<00:01:42.060> goes<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.450> far<00:01:42.720> back

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:44.630 
doesn't look like he goes very far back
it's<00:01:43.619> probably<00:01:43.709> not<00:01:43.920> gonna<00:01:44.039> be<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.429> a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's probably not gonna be much of a

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.949 
it's probably not gonna be much of a
cave<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:47.420> well<00:01:48.420> I'll<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.630> check<00:01:48.840> it
