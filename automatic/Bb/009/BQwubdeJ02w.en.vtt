00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 there 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 my task is the famous fried bread from Emilia Romagna 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.139
 let's start immediately with the yeast 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.429
 pignatelli rido 2 torrent download bulla 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.599
 we emit activity water 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.059
 which way is meant that it should not exceed 40 degrees 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.119
 because if we are warmer water we run the risk of an accident 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.499
 therefore our post does not grow anymore 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:29.810
 gently 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.810
 melt beautiful and wine 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.480
 once the yeast has dissolved 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.680
 we think the flour 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 the sieve 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.550
 it's a little bit the time we sift the flour 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 thus we avoid having lumps in our dough 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.690
 let's add some salt 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 this time he gave a fine salt 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.000
 a teaspoon or hours something renoir that responds well 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.780
 I would recommend 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.790
 to do it with your hands to feel the dough with your hands a little 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 and first of all the whole I share it loose 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.580
 I add a little bit of warm water again 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 there are no exact amounts of water to put into this mixture in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.870
 all the dough pieces are always roughly 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.670
 quantities 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.659
 because because already said other times that the flour can be more oh - 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.350
 freshly ground 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.859
 therefore it can be more or less dry and therefore poppo 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:02.740
 to have 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.400
 need more or less water 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.769
 this dough version resembles that of slightly softer bread 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.079
 because we have to give 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.389
 the possibility for the mixture to grow 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.530
 you can always use a stain a dough says if you want 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:26.259
 my advice is to feel the consistency of the pasta also finished by 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:30.239
 working with the machine you have to work a little with your hands 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 internapoli film on the hands 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.569
 what you see is true 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.589
 the soft button 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:52.069
 it is beautiful because the tub goes things that 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.960
 sololive 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.439
 there are bacteria there are gods 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.470
 the small ones 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.400
 particles that allow military flour always 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.889
 bellano bella with sisters 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.759

 have passed 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.129
 2 hours 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.799
 we take the flour 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.799
 I'll see you 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.389
 and even softer 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.409

 I do this job 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.569
 lower brick

 you noticed momesso grass inside the dough 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.099
 lard had to be put 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.529
 we will come out very destroyed that will be used to fry here 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.659
 just like dedication 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.120
 we put a workout into the show 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.800
 abundant lard 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 peugeot put forlino berkoff noticed melt 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.340
 now it is like a normal effect because it does not know this method of 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.129
 frying film with lard 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.439
 if I have to be with the same system that is used with other fats 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.939

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:16.870
 let it melt we bring you temperature for this for this type 

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:19.869
 of preparation art 170 degrees 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.629
 we cut 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.199
 our pasta 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.199
 first real health 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.150
 you should feel the dough is very soft very delicate 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.879
 the mind is a nice touch 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.259
 so 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 but I adore nothing even the area of ​​the forms 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.310
 I can use a glass 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.569
 a pastry cutter to give it a circular shape 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.909
 own the shapes we want 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.909
