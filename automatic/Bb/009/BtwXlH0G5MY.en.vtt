challenges of trying to make the world a
better<00:02:19.120> place

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
better place

a<00:02:19.959> degree<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.530> quite<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> lot<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.190> research

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
a degree is quite a lot of research

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.340 
a degree is quite a lot of research
focus<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.299> even<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.660> first<00:02:22.900> year<00:02:23.079> we<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.260> not

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
focus so even for first year we do not

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.650 
focus so even for first year we do not
have<00:02:23.470> research<00:02:23.859> interviewing<00:02:24.519> academics<00:02:25.269> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
have research interviewing academics and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.030 
have research interviewing academics and
I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:25.989> really<00:02:26.140> carried<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
I think that's really carried on and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.770 
I think that's really carried on and
then<00:02:27.160> females<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.489> better<00:02:27.670> part<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.150> saying
