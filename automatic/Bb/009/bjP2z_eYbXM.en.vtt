00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
tried Pravana green it just bled way too

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.160

much<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.110> over<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> place<00:00:50.239> weeks<00:00:51.239> after

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
much like all over the place weeks after

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
much like all over the place weeks after
I<00:00:52.199> dyed<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:53.510> special<00:00:54.510> effects<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.260> found

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I dyed it with special effects I found

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
I dyed it with special effects I found
that<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> rinse<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> out

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that you can rinse it out

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
that you can rinse it out
I'd<00:00:58.469> say<00:00:58.680> bleeds<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> most<00:00:59.460> in<00:01:00.359> between<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
I'd say bleeds the most in between the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
I'd say bleeds the most in between the
first<00:01:02.129> time<00:01:02.309> you're<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.489> stood<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
first time you're in stood out and the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
first time you're in stood out and the
first<00:01:03.899> time<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> wash<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.589> after<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
first time you wash it after that it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.870 
first time you wash it after that it
really<00:01:05.960> really<00:01:06.960> doesn't<00:01:07.140> bleed<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.670> all

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
really really doesn't bleed out at all

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.160 
really really doesn't bleed out at all
as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> wearing<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.780> white<00:01:09.930> shirt

for 15 minutes I chose to leave mine in
overnight<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.520> found<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.240> better

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
overnight I found that it's just better

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
overnight I found that it's just better
it<00:01:46.259> helps<00:01:46.770> saturate<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> color<00:01:47.430> into<00:01:47.790> each

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it helps saturate the color into each

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.510 
it helps saturate the color into each
hair<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.100> comes<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:51.920> balanced<00:01:52.920> I'd<00:01:53.340> say

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
hair and comes out more balanced I'd say

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
hair and comes out more balanced I'd say
that<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.600> lighter<00:01:54.930> spots

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that way you don't have lighter spots

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
that way you don't have lighter spots
darker<00:01:55.649> spots<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.009> kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> deal<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.630> um

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
