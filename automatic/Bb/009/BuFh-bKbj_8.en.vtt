00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 I still don't want to be detained 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 then let's talk from there I'll leave you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.340
 thank you friend charly oil production 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.560
 here it is 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.180
 I'm curious and it's still the whole morning that is making this noise 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.310
 look look look look look look here the location is text 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.670
 sant angelo amalfi resort 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.120
 we know that the so-called cold pressing is what we are 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 doing 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.500
 let's be what we are doing this is of course a small machine 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.710
 corporate 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.420
 which was presented just recently launched livariz yahoo to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.799
 demonstration study but because the weather said of arezzo 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.410
 but only representation 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.180
 elvis i love paul factiva augusta activates all the hatreds of excellence of the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 Mediterranean but it is also a great time 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 by focusing commercial interests 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.220
 id all induced by hatred machines ideas impose me as they say from the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 words auditorium the whole chain I drive olive kidneys how much 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.240
 this is one of the models most this model ovarian problem 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 lets i was impressed 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.220
 small size of death so this naked 150 machine 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.930
 it really allows me and let's say in small companies to reproduce 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.080
 an oil of great quality of the foot quality is made to welcome it live 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.820
 working immediately 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.010
 and then being attentive to the cleanliness of our machines the movida has 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.900
 perfectly right because you need to know 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.780
 that the civilization of an oil 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.780
 inversely proportional 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:22.329
 how to say at the time of harvest I explain myself better when the olive is detached and with the 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.359
 his petiole from the tree 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.810
 yes, yes 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.250
 sisi laura you work is more the acidity becomes emo hate that you b + and the scents 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.200
 but one day it exalts them. at most then we are often 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 fascinated when we enter Puglia 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.139
 in umbria however in italy but also throughout europe 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.879
 if we remain fascinated by these large stones zeus thought we use one 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.420
 time when turning it or with human force or corniglia checks or 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.249
 anyway with one 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:59.949
 a year ago a rotary movement we say natural paolo avorio frangevano 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:04.249
 praise olives and so on think that all these great environments necessary for 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.290
 this today is reduced instead 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 to this morning 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.829
 wonderful powerful 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.069
 the so-called extra virgin olive oil 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.830
 unlocks the spice 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.689
 for tomorrow morning we will put on the market 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.910
 then do it yourself damn I'm kidding but instead 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.619
 a very serious question 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.069
 how much hate can be done in 1 hour 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.179
 this is the machine that on average can make a production of about 6 7 of 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.889
 oil figure because this is a small company machine 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.860
 but let's say record 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.960
 I would like to break a spice just spice the spice companies because 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.099
 companies undertake production 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.909
 let's say I really want from the plant to the ball to the machines 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.019
 implant 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.629
 if in the manner 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.009
 own plus + + 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.439
 many possibilities for commitment 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.280
 I can't then honestly get a commercial result 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:02.370
 Berat curiosity 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.290
 to show size how many inhabitants have flesh some sapling of 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 olives with 50 kilos of olives 14 I do 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.639
 cica 50d live video we can do from seven to ten o 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.159
 the million euros 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.669
 then finally we actually made a little less certain of olives at present 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.669
 let's say now very mature because we are in June. 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.319
 then I go I want to taste history 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.319
 we feel 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.469
 the guys 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.469
 do 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:00.999
 adessolei
