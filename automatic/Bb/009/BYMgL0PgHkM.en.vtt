00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
in a lot of time trying to figure out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.400 
in a lot of time trying to figure out
what's<00:02:22.890> going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.070> happen<00:02:23.370> next<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.570> as<00:02:24.780> we

what's going to happen next but as we

what's going to happen next but as we
all<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.860> writing<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.990> can<00:02:28.170> get<00:02:28.440> you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
all know with writing you can get you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.470 
all know with writing you can get you
can<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:28.980> off<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.160> tangents<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.030> figure<00:02:30.300> out

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
can go off on tangents and figure out

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.930 
can go off on tangents and figure out
where<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.930> go<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.500> story<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.250> always<00:02:32.580> keep

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
where to go in the story but always keep

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.730 
where to go in the story but always keep

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
that ending in sight

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.950 
that ending in sight
and<00:02:34.830> that's<00:02:35.490> my<00:02:35.640> best<00:02:35.850> advice<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.180> plotting<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
and that's my best advice for plotting a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.680 
and that's my best advice for plotting a
romance<00:02:37.320> novel
