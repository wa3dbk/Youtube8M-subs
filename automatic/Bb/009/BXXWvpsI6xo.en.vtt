00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
you've had a good one as well so today

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.999 
you've had a good one as well so today
we're<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> be<00:00:12.690> born<00:00:12.900> sang<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.290> little<00:00:13.530> bit

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
we're going to be born sang a little bit

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
we're going to be born sang a little bit
different<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:15.000> literally<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:15.750> back

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
different I have literally just got back

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
different I have literally just got back
and<00:00:16.230> i'm<00:00:16.350> still<00:00:16.560> rather<00:00:16.890> tired<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> thought

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and i'm still rather tired so I thought

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
and i'm still rather tired so I thought
we'd<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> quick<00:00:18.480> episode<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> get

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
we'd do a quick episode just to get

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.740 
we'd do a quick episode just to get
psych<00:00:19.529> out<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.060> wanted<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> make

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
psych out and but I wanted to make

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
psych out and but I wanted to make
something<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.470> bit<00:00:22.680> fun<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.279> us<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
something a little bit fun for us so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
something a little bit fun for us so
today<00:00:24.330> we're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.990> jet<00:00:25.529> pack

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
today we're going to make a jet pack

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.839 
today we're going to make a jet pack
which<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> be<00:00:26.369> damned<00:00:26.640> awesome

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
which going to be damned awesome

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
which going to be damned awesome
somebody<00:00:27.269> electronic<00:00:27.720> jet<00:00:27.869> back<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.289> that's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
somebody electronic jet back and that's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.960 
somebody electronic jet back and that's
just<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> make<00:00:29.220> our<00:00:29.400> lives<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> hell<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
just going to make our lives a hell of a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.330 
just going to make our lives a hell of a
lot<00:00:30.029> easier<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> make<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:31.980> we're

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
lot easier so to make one of these we're

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
lot easier so to make one of these we're
going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> need<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.969> advanced<00:00:33.480> circuit<00:00:33.989> now<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
going to need a advanced circuit now I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
going to need a advanced circuit now I
want<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.920> show<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.370> an<00:00:35.670> advanced

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
want to show you how to make an advanced

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
want to show you how to make an advanced
circuit<00:00:36.390> first<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.170> case<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.469> don't

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
circuit first just in case you don't

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.229 
circuit first just in case you don't
know<00:00:37.739> how<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
know how to do it because this is a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.760 
know how to do it because this is a
recipe<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> you're<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> basically

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
recipe that you're going to basically

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
recipe that you're going to basically
use<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.100> million<00:00:41.760> times<00:00:41.940> over<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.390> again

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
use a million times over and over again

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
use a million times over and over again
so<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.980> make<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.280> advanced<00:00:44.579> circuit<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so to make an advanced circuit you get a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170 
so to make an advanced circuit you get a
electronic<00:00:46.050> circuit<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.100> put<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.670> redstone

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
electronic circuit you put some redstone

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.010 
electronic circuit you put some redstone
like<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> little<00:00:51.750> bit<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like these then you put a little bit of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
like these then you put a little bit of
lapis<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> side<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:54.090> glowstone

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lapis on the side and some glowstone

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.779 
lapis on the side and some glowstone
round<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> gives<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.250> advanced

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
round here and that gives you a advanced

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.160 
round here and that gives you a advanced
circuit<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.480> about<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> circuits<00:00:58.140> you're

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
circuit now about the circuits you're

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630 
circuit now about the circuits you're
going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> million<00:00:59.070> times<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
going to use like a million times so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
going to use like a million times so
definitely<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.539> used<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> using<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
definitely get used to using that and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.920 
definitely get used to using that and
remember<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.670> recipe<00:01:03.120> even<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.780> than

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
remember that recipe even more than

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
remember that recipe even more than
using<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.379> regular<00:01:05.189> circuit<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
using the regular circuit because all of

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.550 
using the regular circuit because all of
your<00:01:06.540> main<00:01:06.689> stuff's<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.290> used<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
your main stuff's going to be used of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.359 
your main stuff's going to be used of
advanced<00:01:07.830> circuits<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.750> yeah<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:10.229> good<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
advanced circuits so yeah that's good so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.640 
advanced circuits so yeah that's good so
that's<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> advanced<00:01:11.909> Circuit<00:01:12.330> made<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
that's the advanced Circuit made now to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
that's the advanced Circuit made now to
actually<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.369> we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> need<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
actually make it we're going to need a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
actually make it we're going to need a
bat<00:01:15.509> box<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.220> some

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
bat box and we're going to need some

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
bat box and we're going to need some
refined<00:01:17.909> iron<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.869> let's<00:01:19.020> grab<00:01:19.229> some<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
refined iron so let's grab some of this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.240 
refined iron so let's grab some of this
stuff<00:01:20.000> here<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.619> now<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> recipe<00:01:23.070> goes<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
stuff here we do now the recipe goes a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.090 
stuff here we do now the recipe goes a
little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> back

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
little bit like this so you put a back

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.609 
little bit like this so you put a back
box<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.970> put<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.240> Van<00:01:27.509> Slyke<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> here

cool isn't it and this is going to make
up<00:01:40.560> two<00:01:40.770> million<00:01:41.009> times<00:01:41.189> easier<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.640> let's<00:01:41.820> run

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
up two million times easier so let's run

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
up two million times easier so let's run
jetpacks<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.570> charge<00:01:42.780> by<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.229> clunking

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
jetpacks you can charge by just clunking

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
jetpacks you can charge by just clunking
it<00:01:43.950> inside<00:01:44.460> these<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.659> go<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.560> can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
it inside these there we go and you can

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.929 
it inside these there we go and you can
see<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> slowly<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:47.850> that's

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
see that slowly going up so that's

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.330 
see that slowly going up so that's
charging<00:01:48.450> quite<00:01:48.600> nicely<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.950> does<00:01:50.100> kind

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
charging quite nicely and it does kind

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
our power and get something like an MFE

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
our power and get something like an MFE
which<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.640> hold<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.060> hell<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.780> hell
