What does BC Forest mean to British Columbians?
It means roads, it means hospitals. it means

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.839
an economy for the past 100 plus years. Commercial
fishing, commercial hunting, timber harvesting,

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.020
milling the logs that come from timber harvesting.
We play in it, we recreate in

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.100
it, we work in it. It's whats sustained our
rivers, our food source, our way of life.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.740
Forest Practices Board. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.780
The Forest Practices
Board is an important part of the Forest Management

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.019
Framework in British Columbia. First off,
they're in independent third party, arms length

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.280
from government and industry. And in that
capacity they have the ability to do independent

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.119
audits. They have the ability to act as an
ombudsman in the event that people have concerns

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:53.360
or complaints. Forest Practices Board provides
the oversight and independent auditing that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.939
ensures that how we're conducting our operations
on the land base are consistent with the act.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:04.000
Forest Practices Board, I think, has played
an important role for the First Nations as

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.080
a third party, reliable source. For the Forest
Practices Board audit process, we start with

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.040
randomly picking a district and then identifying
a licensee. We let them know that they will

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.600
be audited and its about a four week notification
and then we'll have an audit team come in,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.490
they'll identify all the populations of harvesting,
roads, the various activities that the licensee

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.700
has done in the past year or two. We'll assess
those activities on the ground and then ultimately

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.159
we'll complete a report that's publicly released.
I think people need to know that BC's forests

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.620
are very well managed. We have a good system
for ensuring that people's needs and aspirations

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.330
around the forest get met. We have an adaptive
system to make sure that things can change

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.330
when they need to. The transparency and inclusiveness
of forest management as it exists today will

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.430
stand us in good stead as we make decisions
for the next decades to come. Forest Practices

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.479
and Management is much more inclusive for
First Nations, local communities, industry

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.080
and government now. I think it has created
a great opportunity for us to work in a more

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.200
positive manner together. I'd say the most
important role of the Forest Practices Board

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.200
is just being there, just being an entity,
a body that somebody if they have some concerns,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.510
they can come and speak to the Board, we'll
look at complaints, but it also, it just lets

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.200
people in BC know that somebody's out there
and assessing the practices. I mean, this

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.530
is our forest. 95% is Crown land. We own it
and I think it's gonna be a key economic driver

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.440
for BC for years to come.
