00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all of you so we get 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.450
 found in this video for a fashion 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.160
 zombies 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.310
 ok ok that's because it's very simple 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.630
 to say we are 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:16.270
 it is closed on a map and the purpose of 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.610
 put them 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.620
 I survive 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.470
 gold continues today at these centers 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.520
 you have to avoid as i tell 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.740
 bankruptcy and that touches me 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.290
 in fact 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.510
 on their screen it appears earlier and 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160
 in fact 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.289
 sign that every hour earlier we get 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.829
 turns into a zombie greeting 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.829
 picchu who 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.240
 so the after in our video I am 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.670
 find the mode 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.280
 except escape so there you can 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.989
 notice the balls are unlimited 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.780
 that is, I can draw as much 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.140
 that I do not need to recharge often 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.530
 the houses that are with slabs is 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 limit 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.040
 the worst I have maybe go to me 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.570
 tap to show what it gives 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.440
 because it's more interesting for 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.440
 see what it's like 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.230
 clearly 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.100
 make touch 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.100
 then a little home 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.480
 are only three in place 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.480
 I 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.520
 we want 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.520
 some games 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.480
 only at home 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.380
 so here I can show so see her 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.610
 I have a knife I nothing else and my 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 goal it's going to be to touch the players 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.030
 celine 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.940
 I answered and it's obviously a failure 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.550
 know it 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.550
 hot 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.569
 plus it would be good 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.200
 I can do 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.200
 through obstacles 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.879
 you see there a little class and I 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.879
 would like to do a job 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.930
 and thus transforms into win tomorrow 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.060
 so here I hope you have planned 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.130
 what was the zombie mode it was before 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.090
 a quick video to make you 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.690
 discover so I would say more for a 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.690
 next video
