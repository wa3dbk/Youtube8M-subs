00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the information is out there I mean it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.359 
the information is out there I mean it
has<00:01:17.939> been<00:01:18.119> released<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.869> has<00:01:19.080> been<00:01:19.259> shown

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
has been released it has been shown

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.560 
has been released it has been shown
there<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.790> people<00:01:20.939> who<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.330> believe

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
there are some people who don't believe

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.940 
there are some people who don't believe
it<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.530> people<00:01:22.590> who

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it but there are also some people who

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.020 
it but there are also some people who
believe<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.460> moon<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.640> made<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
believe that the moon is made out of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
believe that the moon is made out of
cheese<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.080> say<00:01:25.290> you've<00:01:25.799> never

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
cheese and you can say you've never

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
cheese and you can say you've never
investigated<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.450> would

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
investigated it but I think you would

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.819 
investigated it but I think you would
probably<00:01:27.840> say<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> moon<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.500> made<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
probably say the moon is not made out of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.050 
probably say the moon is not made out of
cheese<00:01:29.130> well<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> certainly<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:32.060> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
cheese well I certainly would but the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749 
cheese well I certainly would but the
reason<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.420> spoke<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> bill<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.400> simply

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
reason I spoke up on this bill is simply

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.550 
reason I spoke up on this bill is simply
because<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> lot<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> division<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
because there is a lot of division in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050 
because there is a lot of division in
the<00:01:37.650> country<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.250> believe<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.880> put

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the country and I believe this would put

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.840 
the country and I believe this would put
an<00:01:39.210> end<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.630> any<00:01:39.930> future<00:01:40.650> controversy<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
an end to any future controversy about a
