00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
into containers because the snow just

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
into containers because the snow just
won't<00:00:18.029> melt<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.480> I'd<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.260> cold<00:00:19.590> weather

eight degree nights and it's causing a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.779 
eight degree nights and it's causing a
problem<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> show<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.460> how

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
I've been taking care of all these

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.529 
I've been taking care of all these
plants<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.130> essentially<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.240> light

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
plants that essentially don't have light

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.240 
plants that essentially don't have light
I've<00:00:27.720> been<00:00:27.900> rotating<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:29.070> these

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I've been rotating them through these

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
I've been rotating them through these
stations<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.170> last<00:00:31.439> two<00:00:31.710> days<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
stations in the last two days this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.610 
stations in the last two days this
station<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.850> these<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.239> t8<00:00:33.570> bulbs<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
station here these are t8 bulbs in a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.220 
station here these are t8 bulbs in a
nice<00:00:35.130> fixture<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.510> stopped<00:00:36.750> working<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
nice fixture it just stopped working I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
nice fixture it just stopped working I
don't<00:00:37.320> know<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.680> wrong<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.129> had<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.460> go

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
don't know it was wrong so I had to go

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
don't know it was wrong so I had to go
out<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> pick<00:00:39.540> up<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.960> more<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> thought<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
out and pick up some more so I thought I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
out and pick up some more so I thought I
would<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.860> show<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.190> these<00:00:41.790> are<00:00:42.000> t8<00:00:42.300> bulb

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
would just show you these are t8 bulb

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.330 
would just show you these are t8 bulb
fixtures<00:00:43.110> four-foot<00:00:43.649> fluorescent<00:00:44.160> lights

fixtures four-foot fluorescent lights
the<00:00:44.579> smaller<00:00:44.879> bulbs<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:47.510> $14.97<00:00:48.510> at

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the smaller bulbs this was a $14.97 at

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.779 
the smaller bulbs this was a $14.97 at
Lowe's<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:49.950> fixtures<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
Lowe's and the other fixtures for the

t12 the fatter fluorescent bulbs and
that<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> think<00:00:53.489> about<00:00:53.760> 12<00:00:54.149> bucks<00:00:54.329> they're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that was I think about 12 bucks they're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
that was I think about 12 bucks they're
not<00:00:55.079> too<00:00:55.230> expensive<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> didn't<00:00:56.190> really

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
not too expensive but I didn't really

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.810 
not too expensive but I didn't really
want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> spend<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> money<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.520> get

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
want to spend the money so they will get

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
want to spend the money so they will get
hooked<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.660> help<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.020> with

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hooked up and they will help out with

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
hooked up and they will help out with
some<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> emergency<00:01:01.920> lighting<00:01:02.129> those<00:01:02.670> are

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
some of the emergency lighting those are

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
some of the emergency lighting those are
cucumbers<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> zucchinis<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.140> another

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
cucumbers and zucchinis from another

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820 
cucumbers and zucchinis from another
video<00:01:04.559> they're<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.519> gonna<00:01:05.670> die<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
video they're just gonna die out and you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
video they're just gonna die out and you
come<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> only

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
come over here you can see that I only

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
come over here you can see that I only
have<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.750> light<00:01:09.960> setup<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.950> set

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have one light setup this was really set

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.359 
have one light setup this was really set
up<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.700> two<00:01:11.939> flats<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.369> emergency

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
up for just two flats so emergency

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
up for just two flats so emergency
lighting<00:01:14.610> means<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> enough<00:01:15.990> light

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
lighting means I don't have enough light

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.590 
lighting means I don't have enough light
so<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.860> plants<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.520> been

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
so some of these plants have been

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
so some of these plants have been
sitting<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> dark<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.229> 24<00:01:19.710> hours<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.850> bulb

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
sitting in a dark for 24 hours that bulb

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
sitting in a dark for 24 hours that bulb
or<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.930> fixture<00:01:22.320> isn't<00:01:22.860> enough<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> cover

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
or this fixture isn't enough to cover

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.929 
or this fixture isn't enough to cover
all<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:25.170> rotate<00:01:25.650> plants<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
all of this so I just rotate plants you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330 
all of this so I just rotate plants you
know<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.840> leave<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> lights<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.470> 24<00:01:29.070> hours

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
know and I leave the lights on 24 hours

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940 
know and I leave the lights on 24 hours
so<00:01:29.460> 24<00:01:29.880> hours<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.500> I'll<00:01:31.680> switch

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so 24 hours like that so now I'll switch

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
so 24 hours like that so now I'll switch
them<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:35.570> leave<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> lights<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.110> 24

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
them to here leave the lights on 24

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
them to here leave the lights on 24
hours<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.880> perfect<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:40.200> plants<00:01:40.560> are

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hours and it's not perfect my plants are

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.050 
hours and it's not perfect my plants are
starting<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.159> yellow<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:42.030> areas

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
starting to yellow out in some areas

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
starting to yellow out in some areas
from<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> lack<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> Sun<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.310> pretty

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
should be outside a couple bamboo poles

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.320 
should be outside a couple bamboo poles
and<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.239> wood<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and some wood I

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.650 
and some wood I
some<00:02:14.370> string<00:02:15.370> some<00:02:15.610> jute<00:02:15.850> sets<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
some string some jute sets up the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.820 
some string some jute sets up the
trellis<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.040> rotate<00:02:18.490> them<00:02:18.760> around

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
trellis but I just rotate them around

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.380 
trellis but I just rotate them around
 it<00:02:21.040> in<00:02:21.190> front<00:02:21.400> of<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.580> light<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.300> other

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
 it in front of the light the other

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.240 
 it in front of the light the other
bucket<00:02:22.630> goes<00:02:22.990> out<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.350> light<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.710> then<00:02:24.130> I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
bucket goes out of the light and then I

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
bucket goes out of the light and then I
spin<00:02:24.550> these<00:02:24.670> around<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.480> every<00:02:25.750> half<00:02:25.960> a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
spin these around you know every half a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.620 
spin these around you know every half a
day<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.800> something<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:28.060> working

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
day or something like that it's working

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.140 
day or something like that it's working
but<00:02:29.050> again<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.130> should<00:02:30.430> really<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.700> outside

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
but again you should really be outside

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.240 
but again you should really be outside
but<00:02:31.690> 8<00:02:31.840> degrees<00:02:32.200> 10<00:02:32.590> degrees<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.890> night<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.220> just

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.270 
but 8 degrees 10 degrees a night is just
too<00:02:33.610> cold<00:02:33.850> for<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.300> peas<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.860> as<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.100> come

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
too cold for the peas so as you come

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.150 
too cold for the peas so as you come
around<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:38.260> see<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.740> guy's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
they were just closed out so I basically

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.009

got $100 there and you know maybe 60

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.300 
got $100 there and you know maybe 60
dollars<00:03:50.350> here<00:03:51.420> really<00:03:52.420> cheaply<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.350> was<00:03:53.560> not

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
dollars here really cheaply this was not

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.820 
dollars here really cheaply this was not
even<00:03:54.489> ten<00:03:54.760> bucks<00:03:54.940> for<00:03:55.150> five<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:56.230> was<00:03:56.380> 15

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
even ten bucks for five and this was 15

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.110 
even ten bucks for five and this was 15
dollars<00:03:57.160> for<00:03:57.190> something<00:03:57.430> would<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.700> cost<00:03:57.850> me<00:03:58.090> a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
dollars for something would it cost me a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
dollars for something would it cost me a
hundred<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.959> guess<00:03:59.500> in<00:03:59.620> weird<00:03:59.830> ways<00:03:59.890> things

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
hundred so I guess in weird ways things

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.040 
hundred so I guess in weird ways things
work<00:04:00.640> out<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.060> as<00:04:01.120> long<00:04:01.269> as<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.420> get<00:04:01.480> my<00:04:01.690> plants
