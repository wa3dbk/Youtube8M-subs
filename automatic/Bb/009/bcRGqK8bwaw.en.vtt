I'm walking around for like a minute or
two<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.490> don't<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:15.030> anyone<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.780> yet

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
two and I don't see anyone and yet

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.230

sometimes<00:02:16.800> I'll<00:02:17.190> spawn<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.880> I'll<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.150> an

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
sometimes I'll spawn and I'll see an

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.920 
sometimes I'll spawn and I'll see an

think that they should have done them
this<00:02:24.060> game<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.540> way<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:24.810> did<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.500> hoping

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
happens but ideally I'd like to see

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.310 
happens but ideally I'd like to see
modern<00:03:38.880> warfare<00:03:39.030> two<00:03:39.360> without<00:03:39.570> like<00:03:39.900> new<00:03:40.110> to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
modern warfare two without like new to

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160 
modern warfare two without like new to
danger<00:03:40.890> close<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.580> sort<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.269> thing<00:03:42.330> you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
danger close and that sort of thing you

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.479 
danger close and that sort of thing you
can<00:03:43.290> maybe<00:03:43.410> tune<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.980> weapons<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.370> it

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
can maybe tune down the weapons of it

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.220 
can maybe tune down the weapons of it
but<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.700> want<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> see<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.209> same<00:03:45.720> sort<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.080> hit

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
but I want to see that same sort of hit

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.740 
but I want to see that same sort of hit
detection<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.920> liked<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.760> lot<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.060> those<00:03:48.180> maps<00:03:48.450> I

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
detection I liked a lot of those maps I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.140 
detection I liked a lot of those maps I
like<00:03:49.050> to<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.350> spawn<00:03:49.620> system<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.820> could<00:03:50.940> use<00:03:51.120> a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
like to the spawn system it could use a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.230 
like to the spawn system it could use a
bit<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.450> tune

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
bit of tune

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.030 
bit of tune
but<00:03:52.530> honestly<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:54.040> game<00:03:54.280> was<00:03:54.580> pretty<00:03:55.150> good

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
but honestly that game was pretty good

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.260 
but honestly that game was pretty good
I'd<00:03:57.040> say<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.400> when<00:03:57.640> was<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.060> most

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
I'd say that when was the most

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.140 
I'd say that when was the most
entertaining<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.190> if<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:00.880> could<00:04:01.060> go

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
entertaining and that if they could go

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.510 
entertaining and that if they could go
back<00:04:01.360> towards<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.080> black<00:04:02.290> ops<00:04:02.500> 2<00:04:02.740> that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
back towards that with black ops 2 that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.460 
back towards that with black ops 2 that
would<00:04:03.700> be<00:04:03.820> great<00:04:04.110> anyways<00:04:05.110> I'm<00:04:05.320> probably

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
would be great anyways I'm probably

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.680 
would be great anyways I'm probably
gonna<00:04:05.650> be<00:04:05.800> playing<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.190> bit<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.400> mw2<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.540> bit

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
which might actually be cool maybe I

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.340 
which might actually be cool maybe I
should<00:04:30.490> try<00:04:30.610> that<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:31.720> like<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.200> like

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
should try that it's like this I like

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.590 
should try that it's like this I like
count<00:04:33.100> as<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> mod<00:04:33.670> is<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.120> consider<00:04:34.450> like<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
count as a mod is that consider like a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.920 
count as a mod is that consider like a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
mod or a hacked or something or I don't

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.810 
mod or a hacked or something or I don't
know<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.320> just<00:04:38.560> like<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> passive<00:04:39.430> device

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
know is it just like a passive device

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.420 
know is it just like a passive device
that<00:04:40.180> converts<00:04:40.570> things<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.890> interest<00:04:42.220> to

that converts things I the interest to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.600 
that converts things I the interest to
see<00:04:42.640> how<00:04:42.790> that<00:04:42.970> works<00:04:43.950> because<00:04:44.950> apparently

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
see how that works because apparently

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
lot easier to aim with and then if you

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.110
