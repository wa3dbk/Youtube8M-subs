00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.790
 alfredo tell us how you found 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.379
 on the ball point set, I'll go 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.060
 to tell the truth excited excited 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.269
 because I've had a feeling like that 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.920
 little mix of who really is 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.389
 because once that's the case because I 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.070
 for the first time he was with computation 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.420
 ball and yet the feeling that 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.610
 been all my life in the end I 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.970
 it all came from a familiarity 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.290
 of a closeness that does not stop being 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.660
 curious comfortable and then really with 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.670
 I wish that this will not end this 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.830
 pedrerol this has to last longer 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.350
 it's very short to me it has been 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.810
 very short fact this has to be talked about 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.610
 hear and see you sure you had 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.650
 also the program tell us what is it 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.700
 that you think you need to contribute what 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.170
 is what comes to contribute to point ball 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.970
 that is the touch of yours that you are going to 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.980
 contribute that it can be different and it's going to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.650
 improve the program let's see it's about 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.450
 that in the end everyone is a little a 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.400
 little what is really not I think that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.190
 there are people who have very well defined what 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.989
 that what you want to be point ball there 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.480
 and people that we all have in our heads 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.100
 that they are not characters that have 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.820
 a very very well-acquired personality 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 and that represents very well the kind of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.850
 public that is there behind 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.869
 Seeing me what I come to contribute is 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.869
 a kind of heritage of journalism 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.340
 that that motive of journalism is that 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.890
 it's excessive as I think it has to 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.509
 be many times the journalism that has 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.759
 to be aggressive but also a little 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.149
 hereditary of that journalism that never 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.930
 can die that is journalism more than 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.200
 research to know that it is very much 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.820
 beyond good and with that the tertuliano 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.890
 believe this that you will have more 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.210
 discussions and how many you're going to 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.720
 give better 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.720
 I 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.770
 I would not leave anybody calm I would say 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.820
 to all who are attentive 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.610
 I see that with 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.540
 people like quim hogarnech with people like 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.850
 carme barcelÃ³ the coexistence will have 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.490
 a lot of merry-go-round 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.869
 and I think at the most unexpected moment 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.790
 may appear alliances that seem very 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.100
 strong and that break immediately or 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.680
 I really do not know in the end how 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.510
 finish this is an interesting cocktail 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.220
 let's go see good no no no no 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.569
 I would dare to say it good many times 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.900
 alfredo and welcome many others 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.900
 Thank you
