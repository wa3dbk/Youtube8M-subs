00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hey people in this video I'll show you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 like her the plug-in wireless redstone 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 At first, what can it do? 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
 plug in prius batstone can be like the name 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.139
 already says wireless redstone signals 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.820
 transfer 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 We used signs that we 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.540
 Assign different functions 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 in the simplest sense, we have one 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 transmitter and a receiver with it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 and receiver to act there is channel 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 Assignments comparable to frequencies 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.630
 so the sender can use the channel id 1 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 2 3 only receivers reach the same 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.520
 channel id 1 23 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.989
 one transmitter will suffice for several 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.690
 receiver 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.280
 who own the same channel as soon as the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 transmitter by a switch or button 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 This activates all receivers 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 signs like channel lady in red 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 already signals resp 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.039
 redstone torches transformed into this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 plugin we use the words 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 transmitter for transmitter and receiver for 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.120
 receiver where the transmitter only one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.230
 kind of states we have allowed 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.539
 receiver a few more options 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 once the default as it was just like 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.469
 then explains the inverter receiver because 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 only the other way round works when 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.280
 the transmitter then sends out a signal 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.200
 the receiver has no redstone signal 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.000
 the transmitter signal disappears 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.070
 receiver should be a redstone again 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.979
 signal the player receiver 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.869
 so we could hire that one 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 Delay gives if transmit 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.860
 is activated it needs the specified 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.729
 for a second , so that the receiver 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.710
 is activated 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 if the transmitter then activates 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
 is so synonymous goes only the specify 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 seconds to number the receiver as well 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.460
 is deactivated 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 then we have the button receiver 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 comparable to a redstone klopp 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 if the transmit is activated then the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.439
 receiver specified milliseconds 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.450
 this amount as long as the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.520
 transmit the signal is always activated 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.320
 again do to off and back on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 And finally, there is still one 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 screen where we specify a channel 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 can to see if this channel 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.490
 is activated or not 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.690
 possibly for more complex redstone 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.280
 projects 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.170
 inside we have a few more 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 commons work with the signs 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.900
 to relieve something 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.150
 with / who holds you get one 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.160
 Overview of all commands with special 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.200
 who transmitters to the shell name 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.550
 can we have a transmitter so one 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.870
 place transmitter for us 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.300
 We can do the same with the same 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.760
 make receiver the command is / 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.100
 the receiver and the channel name 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.140
 with session who in Poland to low 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.360
 We also get channel names like 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.040
 on the screen indicated whether the screen 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.840
 channel is activated or not 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.310
 with flash verl you can all 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.020
 See used challandes 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.960
 maybe if there are a few more later 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.730
 will / who list to us 23 next 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.210
 the other pages to the channels 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 call mitchell whether we can channels 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.480
 close completely 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.430
 no transmitter will be this channels 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.960
 then send out a signal to the more 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 channel to open again we give a lot 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.350
 hard unlock and its associated 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.270
 name one 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.710
 the good thing is if a player has one 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.240
 to can be claimed for channel 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.980
 no other user with this shell 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.960
 use that prevents several 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.890
 user independently of each other the same 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.480
 use channel 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.250
 what happens then everyone should 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.050
 then we can have one more 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.760
 a few breathing errors with me but 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.000
 unfortunately not work why too 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.620
 always 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
 so we would have the opportunity others 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.950
 user still to an existing ring 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.320
 try it with you 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.000
 and write it in the kombis if the 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.980
 Atmosphere working for you 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 by the way , the new orders are here 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 so then we still have the per missions 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.800
 best installed her walter led 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.840
 with all via mission plugins mittweida 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.550
 svensson compatible are basically 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.660
 reach the wave of pensions stepstone 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.310
 create and remove stars come 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.870
 sap.info list and so lures for the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.910
 user group so that the player the plugin 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.430
 use but do not mist with it 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.080
 you can see the panicky here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.730
 the you can offer your according to your kipper 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.110
 then add as you like if you like 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.450
 the murder group or so still breathing 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.340
 I wanted to distribute passions 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 to have said everything with others 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.459
 ask comments penner me and if 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.080
 it really has been that time, please 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.470
 let's say see and then next 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.470
 Video 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.090
 there
