00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.260
 ah 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello how welcome are you to this video 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.259
 tutorial on how to change the size of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.660
 an image in photoshop the first thing 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.740
 we have to do is definitely go to the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 image I will go to this image 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.980
 to which the information of the image 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.849
 put the name of the file tells me the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.080
 type of image 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:40.340
 the size 14.4 megabytes and tells me the 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.059
 dimensions 4000 selection of 52 x 3.168 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.570
 to change it then let's go open 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.110
 with another mouse right open with me 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.750
 I go directly to photoshop and now the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 photo will not send it directly 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 to photoshop 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.690
 so once the photoshop opens 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.930
 we do not have here 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.280
 we will see a message which we have 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 what to give to ok 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.140
 and we have our image worth 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 here I have 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 the image of the old woman 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.520
 what I have to do is change the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.560
 size for it because I have to enter 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 in image 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 here I look for image size 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.000
 and here I have the size it has 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.079
 we remember that we have seen that the size 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.320
 it was four thousand 752 for three thousand 168 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.990
 now I want to reduce it in another size 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.899
 what I have to do is if I want 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 be reduced in a proportional way 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.110
 I give it to restrict proportions so 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.569
 we see how this appears here as 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 is in unity and now I'm going to put 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.330
 for example so that it has a width 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.400
 of two thousand floors directly I'm going to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.250
 put here the height 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.090
 it is proportional 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.090
 I see that he has done me that way 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.610
 proportional 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.129
 in the case that what you want to do 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 be disproportionately 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:32.490
 any reason then he will have to get me 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 back to the image image size 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.200
 take away the restrict proportions and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.190
 here for example because I put that I want 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.870
 1000 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.420
 x 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.340
 for example 250 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.130
 and the image will remain as that of a poet who 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.080
 I do not want to continue with this step and 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.980
 I want to go back remember that always 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.980
 we have in step back edition 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 I return to give the edition and step back and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.530
 here is how the original image looks 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.890
 let's do it again image size 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.930
 of image 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.290
 in a way to provide life for him 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:18.040
 I will put for example 1500 thanks for 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.000
 1000 will be the proportion but I here and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.110
 now to save it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.110
 I'm going to file 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.320
 in the file I give 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.320
 save as 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.030
 the son where I want to put it for 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.030
 save 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.180
 for example here in download itself and already 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:47.160
 put the name and now I put another 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.680
 name that would be 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.140
 the one that will reduce them from current 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.680
 I always realized that in one format 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.409
 jpg to have it as a photo and if 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.990
 I want to edit it directly to the 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.980
 png or photoshop format 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.110
 from save 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.780
 here I choose the quality I always choose 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.720
 the maximum and the ok 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.070
 has already been saved now I say to the finer 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:23.260
 and I see 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:26.040
 that I have the image file 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.040
 reduced 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.450
 it would 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.990
 download I bet you old lady london 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.530
 reduced it takes me 903 k 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.870
 and we already know what exactly 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.570
 we have we can open here in sight 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.910
 previous we see the image of this 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.940
 old woman already reduced to the size 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.210
 we wanted so far this video 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.180
 tutorial 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.690
 and many thanks for lending 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.690
 attention to
