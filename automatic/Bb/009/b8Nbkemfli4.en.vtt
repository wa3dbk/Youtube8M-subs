00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pave low and osprey gunner set up and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.660 
pave low and osprey gunner set up and
basically<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.189> basically<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> spawn

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
basically this is a basically a spawn

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
basically this is a basically a spawn
trap<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.780> there's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> difference<00:01:13.470> between

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
trap I know there's a difference between

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.429 
trap I know there's a difference between
a<00:01:13.950> spawn<00:01:14.220> trap<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.790> spawn<00:01:15.150> containment<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
a spawn trap and spawn containment this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
a spawn trap and spawn containment this
is<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> spawn<00:01:17.430> containment<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
is kind of spawn containment but this is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
is kind of spawn containment but this is
the<00:01:19.560> least<00:01:19.830> amount<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> rushing<00:01:20.640> I've<00:01:20.790> ever

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the least amount of rushing I've ever

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
the least amount of rushing I've ever
done<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.570> game<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
done in one game on you you know a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.340 
done in one game on you you know a
rusher<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> different<00:01:25.200> play

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
rusher this is kind of a different play

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.190 
rusher this is kind of a different play
style<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:27.119> isn't<00:01:27.330> something<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
style and this isn't something that you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
style and this isn't something that you
know<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.799> course<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.400> been<00:01:29.579> done<00:01:29.790> on

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
know of course this has been done on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.620 
know of course this has been done on
YouTube<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.840> exact<00:01:31.530> same<00:01:31.799> setup<00:01:32.189> before<00:01:32.630> but

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
noobish mistakes but I think anybody can

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.780 
noobish mistakes but I think anybody can
do<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.320> they<00:02:36.470> have<00:02:36.680> some<00:02:36.920> decent<00:02:37.580> gun

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
do this if they have some decent gun

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.310 
do this if they have some decent gun
skill<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.270> really<00:02:38.480> good<00:02:38.660> decision-making

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
skill and really good decision-making

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.240 
skill and really good decision-making
and<00:02:39.650> obviously<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.310> full<00:02:40.700> party<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.890> think

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and obviously a full party so I do think

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250 
and obviously a full party so I do think
this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> pretty<00:02:44.000> pretty<00:02:44.690> common<00:02:45.230> pretty

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260
