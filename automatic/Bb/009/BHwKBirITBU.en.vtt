00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.870
 you are looking for a smartphone that does not bring 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.170
 android windows on or ios in that case you 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.570
 you could dare with the aquarium bq 4.5 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.309
 point edition that as read in the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.440
 product name brings system 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.270
 ubuntu operative in the sale package 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.009
 we will only find the terminal in 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.050
 yes a charger with data cable 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.300
 Removable and timely documentation 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.429
 to immerse yourself in the unknown 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.199
 characteristics and ways of operating of 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.589
 ubuntu from the point of view of 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.839
 design 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.390
 this smartphone brings dragontrail crystal 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.580
 to protect the front face which 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.770
 contrasts with the plastic used to 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.840
 cover and form the rest of the body of the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.510
 terminal with totally smooth surface 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.300
 I have been able to verify that the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.670
 frame looks harder and seemingly more 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.980
 resistant on the front face will highlight 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.120
 the 4.5 inch screen with 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.700
 resolution of 960 x 540 pixels and a led 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.250
 front for notifications you 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.990
 miss if you do not see touch buttons in the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.670
 lower margin or in the interface 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.320
 user because that is not the way to 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.909
 operate the operating system of ubuntu 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.060
 of the cell phone 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.219
 the aquarium of 4.5 point edition no 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.409
 has removable back cover what 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.679
 which makes it impossible to access the battery 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.079
 integrated 2 thousand 150 milliamps but 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.149
 from the top side if you can 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.670
 access card compartment 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.069
 of microsd memory on the left side 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.920
 you will find the access to insert and 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.569
 use two microsim cards the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.369
 ubuntu user interface not us 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.679
 remember no operating system 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.450
 known with a menu on the side 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.000
 left access to applications 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.250
 open by sliding the right finger to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.739
 left window to access the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.689
 main settings and notifications and 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:49.209
 with the startup desktops called 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.099
 scopes that will provide information 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.020
 related to services that we 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.689
 interesting or with installed applications 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.049
 in the terminal plays with the base of 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.170
