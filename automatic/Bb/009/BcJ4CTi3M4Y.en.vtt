00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.289 
good performance against Houston off but
I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:47.010> adamek<00:03:47.579> has<00:03:47.819> shown<00:03:48.030> with<00:03:48.180> his

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
I think adamek has shown with his

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.259 
I think adamek has shown with his
experience<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.959> he'll<00:03:49.230> probably<00:03:49.530> win<00:03:50.269> those

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
experience that he'll probably win those

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.940 
experience that he'll probably win those
fights<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.230> become<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.560> mandatory

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
fights and become the mandatory

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.729 
fights and become the mandatory
challenger<00:03:53.190> for<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.819> IPF<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:55.560> know<00:03:55.650> he

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
challenger for the IPF and you know he

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.520 
challenger for the IPF and you know he
put<00:03:55.889> on<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> great<00:03:56.220> performance<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:57.530> Warsaw

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
put on a great performance in Warsaw

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.620 
put on a great performance in Warsaw
against<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.370> vitally<00:03:59.609> but<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.299> think<00:04:00.480> he's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
against a vitally but I think he's

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.180 
against a vitally but I think he's
learned<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.019> lot<00:04:01.170> since<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.680> fight<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
learned a lot since that fight and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.160 
learned a lot since that fight and
I<00:04:04.190> would<00:04:05.180> expect<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:05.660> nothing<00:04:05.959> against

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
I would expect it's nothing against

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.540 
I would expect it's nothing against
pulav<00:04:06.470> because<00:04:06.709> he's<00:04:06.890> a<00:04:06.920> great<00:04:07.160> fighter<00:04:07.310> as

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
pulav because he's a great fighter as

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.550 
pulav because he's a great fighter as
well<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.910> would<00:04:08.150> just<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.959> Adamek<00:04:09.410> has

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
well I would just think that Adamek has

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.589 
well I would just think that Adamek has
a<00:04:09.590> little<00:04:09.830> bit<00:04:09.920> more<00:04:10.040> experience<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.540> you

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
a little bit more experience and can you

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.290 
a little bit more experience and can you
say<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:12.110> there<00:04:12.319> anything<00:04:12.620> said<00:04:13.040> about<00:04:13.760> second
