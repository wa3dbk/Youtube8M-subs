00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.180
 hello I hope everyone is very 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.279
 very well in this video we are going to do 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.710
 something quick a detail that I hope will 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.200
 like 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.960
 and to give to anyone who 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.110
 we are going to use liquid silicone a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.610
 pencil a black cardboard rules if you 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.970
 they will do exactly as I am going to 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.970
 do I 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.169
 let's use I'm going to use a 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.899
 eighth but can use is not some 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.470
 smaller piece but need two of the 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.470
 same size 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.949
 and of course we are going to use 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.680
 fluorescent cards or 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.829
 phosphorescent what contrasting what 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.880
 combine but contrast here are 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.570
 these are flourishing 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.210
 and I think it's no more let's start what 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.470
 first is to divide the eighth into two 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.020
 it remains that way and then another part that is 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.380
 exactly like this what are we going to 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.380
 do now 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.120
 with colored cards 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.570
 florescentes will mark as we have 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.820
 marked lately to the figurines that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 we want, I'm going to mark this heart and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.460
 he is quoted 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.040
 on strong color cardboards 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.040
 different colors and this is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.310
 something like that I did the little heart here 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.830
 already with this we have half of our 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.650
 work done 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.100
 now with cardboard he left over us 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.680
 half and I put a glass stick 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.090
 delgadito and we paint it with a marker 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.730
 black here so you can not see the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.820
 shores lady huequito with the perforadora 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.360
 here so that there is a little bit more 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.370
 volume now what we are going to do is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 paste the figurines like us 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.640
 we want on the cardboard I think that I 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.050
 I will do so 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 if you are going to be exactly the same 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.060
 Well, the idea is obviously that the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.810
 signs look very good 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.690
 that is like that but if you do not want to do it 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.730
 with phosphorescent colors or as 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.640
 call because they definitely do not 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.890
 like what can they do in black and white 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.769
 that looks very nice, either 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 the cardboard at the bottom is white and the 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.739
 figurines are black or backwards 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.290
 I made a false stitching here and now 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.360
 I'm going to paste the figurines also what 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 can do is leave space for a 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.270
 black and white photography or in 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.230
 strong colors so that contrast well 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.080
 then decorate it as you want with 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.200
 the colors that you like most this is the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.960
 result now we're just going to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.750
 paste 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.470
 here on this date to give you some 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.020
 volume I chose 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.480
 some waltz sticks or that there were out there 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.820
 that I had left over from another project that are 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.010
 of half a centimeter but if you 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 they want it to look a little thicker 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.769
 they do it with thicker wood 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.769
 we are going to hit it 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.280
 and this is the end result is already 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.470
 put on the wall you can use it to 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.880
 decorate or to give as I will do 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.980
 I 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.470
 remember that these are simply 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.810
 ideas that you can take some 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.970
 things that I have done to make 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.340
 your projects much more beautiful and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.200
 decorative I hope you like it and that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.200
 all be very good bye
