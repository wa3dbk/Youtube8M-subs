so<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.710> quite<00:02:50.920> intriguing<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:52.120> objects<00:02:52.480> as

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
so it is quite intriguing the objects as

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.810 
so it is quite intriguing the objects as
we<00:02:52.690> can<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.020> all<00:02:53.260> stay<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.740> same<00:02:53.950> formation

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
we can see all stay the same formation

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.460 
we can see all stay the same formation
they<00:02:55.270> don't<00:02:55.450> kind<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.720> swirl<00:02:56.020> around<00:02:56.170> each

other<00:02:56.680> one<00:02:57.160> problem<00:02:57.700> according<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.180> Kate's<00:02:58.630> is

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
other one problem according to Kate's is

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.870 
other one problem according to Kate's is
that<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.410> Grimsley<00:02:59.890> recordings<00:03:00.520> do<00:03:00.700> not

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
that the Grimsley recordings do not

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.900 
that the Grimsley recordings do not
include<00:03:01.240> exact<00:03:01.630> location<00:03:02.320> some<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.400> include

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
include exact location some do include

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.790 
include exact location some do include
time<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.450> date<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:05.260> he<00:03:05.380> needs<00:03:05.590> more

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
time and date but he needs more

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440 
time and date but he needs more
information<00:03:06.460> in<00:03:06.610> order<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.970> eliminate<00:03:07.240> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
information in order to eliminate the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.720 
information in order to eliminate the
possibilities<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.470> these<00:03:08.980> are<00:03:09.190> satellites

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
possibilities that these are satellites

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.210 
possibilities that these are satellites
this<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.330> looks<00:03:10.570> again<00:03:10.960> like<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> spacecraft

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
this one looks again like a spacecraft

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.880 
this one looks again like a spacecraft
in<00:03:12.370> orbit<00:03:12.490> but<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.390> would<00:03:13.510> help<00:03:13.690> us<00:03:13.900> if<00:03:14.320> we

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
in orbit but what would help us if we

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.670 
in orbit but what would help us if we
knew<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> exact<00:03:15.760> location<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:16.990> on<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> screen

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
knew the exact location if on the screen

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.400 
knew the exact location if on the screen
we<00:03:17.890> had<00:03:18.510> azmuth<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.690> know<00:03:19.780> direction<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
we had azmuth you know direction on the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.710 
we had azmuth you know direction on the
compass<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.980> elevation<00:03:21.490> over<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:22.060> well

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
compass and elevation over here well

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.480 
compass and elevation over here well
maybe<00:03:22.930> we're<00:03:23.110> asking<00:03:23.230> for<00:03:23.500> too<00:03:23.650> much<00:03:23.680> well

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
maybe we're asking for too much well

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.860 
maybe we're asking for too much well
then<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.850> could<00:03:25.000> interpolate<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> star

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
then you could interpolate the star

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.840 
then you could interpolate the star
pattern<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.470> night<00:03:26.680> go<00:03:27.280> back<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
pattern for the night go back to the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.850 
pattern for the night go back to the
known<00:03:28.060> spacecraft<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.930> are<00:03:29.080> in<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.320> sky<00:03:29.560> and

known spacecraft that are in the sky and

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.770 
known spacecraft that are in the sky and

I<00:03:48.370> just<00:03:48.610> went<00:03:48.850> down<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.180> list<00:03:49.330> check<00:03:49.870> them<00:03:50.080> all

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
I just went down the list check them all

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.770 
I just went down the list check them all
off<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.800> I<00:03:50.920> say<00:03:51.190> wow<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.910> still<00:03:52.210> there<00:03:52.450> but

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
off and I say wow it's still there but

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.910 
off and I say wow it's still there but
it's<00:03:52.930> not<00:03:53.110> on<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:53.440> list

it's not on my list

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.310 
it's not on my list
I<00:03:54.040> would<00:03:54.700> then<00:03:54.880> again<00:03:55.180> put<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:55.990> higher

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
I would then again put it to a higher

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.720 
I would then again put it to a higher
level<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:57.540> sincerity<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.720> being<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.620> UFO<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.580> is

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
level of sincerity of being a UFO it is

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.640 
level of sincerity of being a UFO it is
