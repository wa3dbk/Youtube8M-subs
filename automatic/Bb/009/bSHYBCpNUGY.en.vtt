00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
a temporary type basis here so once we

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.729 
a temporary type basis here so once we
actually<00:04:19.310> settle<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.910> track<00:04:20.239> plan<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:21.470> will

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
actually settle on a track plan we will

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.129 
actually settle on a track plan we will
be<00:04:22.180> starting<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.360> construction<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.990> our

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
be starting the construction of our

be starting the construction of our
actual<00:04:24.350> layout<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.270> will<00:04:26.389> actually

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
actual layout so and that will actually

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.240 
actual layout so and that will actually
show<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.900> some<00:04:27.169> pictures<00:04:27.200> on<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.770> wall<00:04:27.919> here

real different and attract plan as far
as<00:04:59.699> the<00:04:59.849> main<00:05:00.379> footprint<00:05:01.379> of<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.560> layout<00:05:01.919> it's

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
as the main footprint of the layout it's

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.689 
as the main footprint of the layout it's
going<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.520> be<00:05:02.669> kind<00:05:02.939> of<00:05:03.150> similar<00:05:03.449> just<00:05:03.960> like
