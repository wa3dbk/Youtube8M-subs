make up a camera with pure new

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
make up a camera with pure new
technology<00:00:06.109> why<00:00:07.109> are<00:00:07.319> there<00:00:08.309> means<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.540> take

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
technology why are there means you take

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.470 
technology why are there means you take
the<00:00:09.870> corrigan<00:00:10.260> megapixel<00:00:10.889> sensor<00:00:11.309> we<00:00:12.300> take

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the corrigan megapixel sensor we take

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.079 
the corrigan megapixel sensor we take
out<00:00:12.690> five<00:00:13.349> megapixel<00:00:13.950> images<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
out five megapixel images with all the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.200 
out five megapixel images with all the
details

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:43.830 

that<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.929> to<00:00:22.019> hear<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.380> too

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:04.220 

if<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.070> get<00:00:55.310> the<00:00:56.060> new<00:00:56.240> version<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.690> serious

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.910 

so<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> symbian<00:01:05.430> pero<00:01:06.140> we<00:01:07.140> own<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.620> pelt

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so this is symbian pero we own the pelt

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.850 
so this is symbian pero we own the pelt
each<00:01:08.700> epoch<00:01:09.000> won<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.420> yeah<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.230> I<00:01:10.380> read<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
each epoch won but yeah but I read that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:55.310 
each epoch won but yeah but I read that
maybe<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.910> will

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.290 

use<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.190> world

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
use the world

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:23.460 
use the world
it's<00:01:58.780> very<00:01:58.960> first<00:01:59.310> truly<00:02:00.310> going

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.750 

they<00:02:24.470> give<00:02:24.650> me<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.800> stroke<00:02:24.950> them<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.430> camera

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
they give me a stroke them of the camera

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.400 
they give me a stroke them of the camera
interface<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> camera<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:32.990> starts

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410

up<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.920> automatic<00:02:34.730> mode<00:02:34.940> where<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.510> use

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
up in the automatic mode where you use

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.510 
up in the automatic mode where you use
the<00:02:35.960> PureView<00:02:36.380> technology<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.280> take<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
the PureView technology so you take the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.910 
the PureView technology so you take the
