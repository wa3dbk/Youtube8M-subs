 despite the rise in computers intensity with which it has reached our 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.710
 days 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.300

 a television studio as equipment nonetheless 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.860
 my profession 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.930
 we are talking about this magnitude jbc from 550 telepronter for adoption of 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.560
 tic i for computer program productions 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.720
 the character generator an ecolab switch compenetre and 4 0 a study of 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.090
 race production 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.170
 - production equipment and technical control that will allow the student 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.600
 practice as close to reality as possible production equipment 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 institutions that allow recording in different locations 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.540
 but its importance to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.450
 uv students on all the proposals 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
 to be able to learn to learn to manage 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.810
 equipment of this equipment 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.080
 why 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.800
 make television pÃ©rez 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.870
 have a little imagination playing a little magic 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.230
 and can also practice with all the content that is learned 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.270
 subjects have more 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.410
 Today's digital technology will help us to be able to transmit 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.750
 they do not have different means 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750
 Another advantage of being able to have these technologies in the EU 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 help for students to practice with those that exist in the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.640
 working market 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.790
 with what television channels have 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 what helps them and carries them out is to be a better professional 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.850
 we want to collaborate with the insertion of new diseased minds imaginations 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.789
 they belong equitably 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.639

 the uex has state-of-the-art technology 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.959
 these new facilities are going to help the students to be able to deepen 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.209
 much more knowledge 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.089
 grow with professionals more quickly peaceful 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.289
 it is more effective more efficient 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.399
 our student will go out with another totally prepared to be able

 street in the video control session 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.579
 in different types of iz and china they do is the magic of the tv 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.079
 play with this quinary climate

 welcome and thank you very much 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.059
 now sound and graphic design more insufficient 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.229
 to this technology 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.339
 with them now the youngest 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.449
 Fernando Torres 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.449
 welcome to the lab more than the faculty of computer science 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.739
 We are very happy to be able to inaugurate this lab today 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.809
 I would like to share with you because we are so happy 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.559
 We are with this work 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.759
 the world a technological platform 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.879
 will allow our students to express all their ideas 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.549

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.739
 turkey available 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.739
 why it is so important to have technology at the time of the shock 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.389
 in this way our students 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.779
 they are being able are having experiences inside their university 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.469
