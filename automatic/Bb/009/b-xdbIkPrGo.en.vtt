00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.360 
let's say if i'm building a BBVA team I
could<00:04:17.169> grab<00:04:17.289> a<00:04:17.349> player<00:04:17.650> from<00:04:17.769> Germany<00:04:18.250> and

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
probably saying really Robin because i

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.239

ultimate<00:06:21.620> team<00:06:22.159> and<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.550> really<00:06:22.819> didn't<00:06:23.000> like<00:06:23.089> I

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:23.149 
ultimate team and I really didn't like I

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.670

FIFA<00:06:25.669> it<00:06:26.240> might<00:06:26.419> be<00:06:26.539> good<00:06:26.719> in<00:06:26.839> NHL<00:06:27.259> but<00:06:27.409> it<00:06:27.500> just

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
FIFA it might be good in NHL but it just
