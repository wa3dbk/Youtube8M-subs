 the 27 of October of 1782 was born in genoa 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.870
 one of the most legal figures 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.150
 have been the origin of at least 30 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.670
 biographical studies the legend begins 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.860
 at 5 years it seems that in one of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.900
 the daydreams of his mother appears on 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.350
 demon and tells him that his only son 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.350
 I know 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.240
 despite the great fortune he got 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.520
 knead in a few years continued to wear 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.950
 with black pants and long coats and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.680
 frayed which gave rise to a 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.480
 unmistakable profile was so 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.250
 extraordinary his ability with the 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.470
 violin that ran the legend that the 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.050
 had reached by unnatural means 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.780
 it was rumored that on one occasion 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 killed a rival being condemned by 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.680
 it to prison and that there had sold 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.310
 his soul to the devil in exchange for getting 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.990
 these gifts so portentous this legend 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 keeps a great parallelism with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.600
 mephistopheles one of the characters of 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.130
 fausto creation of the great rocket another 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.709
 legend claimed that being 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.990
 imprisoned for killing his lover 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.970
 He interpreted beautiful compositions in his 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.100
 cell with just a string of his 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.410
 warner and for having broken the three 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 remaining complex fragments 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.959
 violinist despite being ugly 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.850
 neglected and after his die as what 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.250
 describes one of the critics of the time 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.560
 his strong personality attracted 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.170
 Many ladies among their lovers 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 Paulina and Elisabeth are the sisters of the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.650
 emperor 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.459
 Leon Bonaparte and dancers like Antonia 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.260
 bianchi who was the mother of her son Achilles 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.599
 his musical dedication always led 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 couple their quarrelsome and crazy life and 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.739
 a liking for the game that touched the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 pathological gambling is told that in several 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.500
 occasions he came to bet his precious 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.599
 violin few musicians have caused so much 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.459
 furor in their life and they have carried out a 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.349
 mastery of the technique as he did 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.530
 paganini to it contributed enormously 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.599
 his great flexibility to articulate the doctor 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.519
 of nati attended him for years and 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.890
 reported some great details 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.260
 interest his hand has a great 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.170
 elasticity just like your shoulder and your 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.540
 Elbow noticed that when he touched his elbow 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.730
 crossed over the other elbow the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.470
 paganini's flexibility was so great 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.360
 that the one of the thumb reached 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.459
 touch the back of his hand this 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 hyperlaxity allowed him to touch three 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.930
 octaves with little effort it is known that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.420
 I could voluntarily flex 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.150
 laterally the articulation of their 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.220
 distal phalanges repeatedly 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.590
 was asked about his magical 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.900
 secret to which 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.930
 great composer always answered that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.190
 he would reveal it when he retired 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.709
 unfortunately he got so coveted 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.930
 secret with him no doubt his prodigious 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.060
 interpretive skills were due to a 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.670
 connective tissue disorder as 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.130
 now we will see 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.980
 his contemporaries describe him as a 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.080
 be cadaverous with black eyes and the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.020
 white like wax long black hair 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.569
 prominent nose and middle stature the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.880
 skin coloration would adopt some 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.250
 years later a silver gray dye 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.620
 due to the mercurial treatment that 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 received for syphilis said 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.760
 treatment was also responsible 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.470
 of the loss of dental pieces and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.600
 of the stomach discomfort that 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.990
 accompanied the composer throughout 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.030
 his last years the marfan syndrome 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.250
 is the most frequent tissue disorder 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.139
 connective characterized by a 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.540
 alteration of collagen metabolism 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.490
 between its muscle manifestations 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.100
 skeletons are the arak novak 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.760
 lukewarm the skeletal disproportion and a 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.290
 high stature as we have already mentioned 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.930
 paganini was of medium height in 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.790
 As for the Nobac Tilia in the Museum of 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.280
 Conservatory of Paris is saved 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.710
 mold of the hand of pagani which is of 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.160
 normal shape and dimensions your finger 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.470
 index measures 10 1 centimeters and your finger 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.280
 thumb in extension 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.470
 seven centimeters these facts do 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.860
 unlikely that the composer suffered 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.020
 an illness of marfan syndrome 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.880
 ehlers giving is characterized by existing 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.540
 the attitude of hyper joint mobility 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.850
 with greater stretching capacity 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.580
 characteristics that paganini had this 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.070
 syndrome comprises at least 11 types 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.250
 different given what paganini lived 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.920
 for 58 years it is unlikely that 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.900
 presented the fourth type characterized 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.230
 by shortening longevity and by 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.730
 present lower extensibility 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.190
 probably the Italian musician suffered 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.840
 a third type characterized by being 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.030
 benign and because the great laxity 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.330
 joint is not usually accompanied by 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.430
 excessive skeletal deformities of 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.260
 gradually he was losing his voice and 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.300
 he remained hoarse during the two 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.580
 last years of his life among the 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.830
 differential diagnoses are shuffled the 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.630
 tuberculous laryngitis and the lesion of 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.960
 recurrent nerve secondary to a 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.849
 optic aneurysm in any case 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.039
 died in Nice on May 27 , 1840 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.379
 the fame of demoniac persecuted 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.599
 paganini until death as the bishop 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.490
 of Nice denied him ecclesiastical burial 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.589
 having refused to receive the 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.749
 Extreme unction the days before your 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.949
 death for thinking that not yet 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.679
 his time had come 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.080
 his body was embalmed for two 

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:31.689
 long months and later by 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.969
 space of one year was deposited in the 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.979
 basement of his son's house finally 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.319
 was buried in the lazaretto of 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.869
 villafranca but here it would not end the 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.509
 pilgrimage since years later it would be 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:45.699
 moved to other cemeteries until 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.909
 reach the parma where it rests 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.009
 currently the eccentricism of paganini 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:52.959
 and his devilish ability propitiated 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.529
 that he died without founding any school 

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.529
 musical
