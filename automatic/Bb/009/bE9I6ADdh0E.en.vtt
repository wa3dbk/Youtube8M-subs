00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.860 

choke<00:02:10.979> ring<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.670> then<00:02:12.600> there<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.250> basically<00:02:14.250> a

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
choke ring and then there is basically a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.170 
choke ring and then there is basically a
worm<00:02:15.870> gear<00:02:16.260> assembly<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.400> allows<00:02:17.760> you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
worm gear assembly here that allows you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
worm gear assembly here that allows you
to<00:02:18.210> adjust<00:02:18.660> by<00:02:19.290> counter<00:02:20.190> clockwise<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.060> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to adjust by counter clockwise and you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800 
to adjust by counter clockwise and you
open<00:02:21.900> up<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> ring<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.920> by<00:02:23.910> clockwise<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
open up this ring and by clockwise you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.900 
open up this ring and by clockwise you
love<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.500> obviously<00:02:26.040> close<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.580> ring<00:02:26.730> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
love you obviously close the ring and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.670 
love you obviously close the ring and
basically<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> main<00:02:28.380> way<00:02:28.620> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
basically this is the main way you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.830 
basically this is the main way you
control<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.700> flame<00:02:30.030> output<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.660> that's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
control your flame output and that's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
control your flame output and that's
another<00:02:31.080> advantage<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.070> particular

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
another advantage of this particular

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.000 
another advantage of this particular
alcohol<00:02:33.060> stove<00:02:33.330> versus<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> others<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.260> what

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
alcohol stove versus the others and what

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.980 
alcohol stove versus the others and what
they<00:02:35.130> ended<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.400> doing<00:02:35.459> was<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.870> inside

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
they ended up doing was on the inside

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.740 
they ended up doing was on the inside
here<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.070> they<00:02:39.000> actually<00:02:39.209> cut

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
here you can see that they actually cut

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.060 
here you can see that they actually cut
air<00:02:40.560> holes<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:41.190> breed<00:02:42.150> holes<00:02:42.620> into<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.650> can

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
air holes or breed holes into the can

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.720 
air holes or breed holes into the can
and<00:02:44.340> then<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.980> choke<00:02:46.980> ring<00:02:47.010> actually<00:02:47.400> goes

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and then the choke ring actually goes

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.500 
and then the choke ring actually goes
around<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:49.790> anything<00:02:50.790> fire

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
around it and like anything fire

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
around it and like anything fire
obviously<00:02:52.200> need<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.709> components<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
obviously need one of the components is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.640 
obviously need one of the components is
oxygen<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.850> if<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.570> limit<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> oxygen<00:02:55.410> we

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
oxygen so if we can limit the oxygen we

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.770 
oxygen so if we can limit the oxygen we
have<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.800> lower<00:02:56.070> flame<00:02:56.459> if<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.940> increase<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
have a lower flame if we increase the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.110 
have a lower flame if we increase the
oxygen<00:02:58.050> we<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> greater<00:02:58.890> flame<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.610> just

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
oxygen we have a greater flame so just

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.090 
oxygen we have a greater flame so just
allows<00:03:00.390> us<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.690> control<00:03:00.900> our<00:03:01.080> heat<00:03:01.470> output<00:03:01.650> and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
allows us to control our heat output and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.670 
allows us to control our heat output and
allows<00:03:02.850> us<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.209> actually<00:03:03.360> lengthen<00:03:04.080> our<00:03:04.440> burn

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
allows us to actually lengthen our burn

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.330 
allows us to actually lengthen our burn
time<00:03:05.010> or<00:03:06.140> increase<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.410> shorten<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.190> burn

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
time or increase and shorten the burn

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.330 
time or increase and shorten the burn
time<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.300> stove<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.290> very<00:03:10.890> easy<00:03:11.100> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
time of the stove so very easy to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.460 
time of the stove so very easy to
assemble<00:03:11.550> actually<00:03:12.360> there's<00:03:12.989> only<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.290> way

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
assemble actually there's only one way

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.740 
assemble actually there's only one way
to<00:03:13.530> did<00:03:13.950> proof<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:14.940> take<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.420> take<00:03:15.570> your

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
to did proof you can take you take your

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.890 
to did proof you can take you take your
three<00:03:16.170> prongs<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:17.519> look<00:03:17.670> for<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
three prongs and you look for the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.720 
three prongs and you look for the
retaining<00:03:18.900> holes<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.250> basically<00:03:20.430> just

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
retaining holes and you basically just

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.430 
retaining holes and you basically just
line<00:03:21.390> them<00:03:21.480> up<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> retaining<00:03:22.170> walls

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
line them up with the retaining walls

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.630 
line them up with the retaining walls
and<00:03:22.769> slip<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:25.019> fill<00:03:25.350> up<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.530> fuel<00:03:26.400> cap

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
and slip it in you fill up your fuel cap

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.660 
and slip it in you fill up your fuel cap
with<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.530> recommended<00:03:28.530> amount<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.920> fuel<00:03:29.100> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
with the recommended amount of fuel you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.160 
with the recommended amount of fuel you
would<00:03:29.850> put<00:03:30.150> your<00:03:30.360> fuel<00:03:31.350> chamber<00:03:31.650> inside<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
would put your fuel chamber inside and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.860 
would put your fuel chamber inside and
light<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.500> away<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.220> now<00:03:35.880> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
light it and away we go now the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.740 
light it and away we go now the
manufacturer<00:03:37.519> has<00:03:38.519> two<00:03:38.790> extra<00:03:38.940> components

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
manufacturer has two extra components

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.840 
manufacturer has two extra components
that<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:39.959> separate<00:03:40.590> from<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.130> unit<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.730> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that are separate from the unit that you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.789 
that are separate from the unit that you
can<00:03:42.030> buy<00:03:42.180> separately<00:03:42.690> obviously<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> one

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
can buy separately obviously in the one

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.470 
can buy separately obviously in the one
is<00:03:43.950> your<00:03:44.070> windscreen<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.180> highly

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
is your windscreen and I highly

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.259 
is your windscreen and I highly
recommend<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.989> windscreen<00:03:46.290> because<00:03:47.269> most

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
recommend the windscreen because most

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.470 
recommend the windscreen because most
alcohol<00:03:48.780> stoves<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.709> I've<00:03:50.250> started<00:03:50.640> using<00:03:51.000> a

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
alcohol stoves that I've started using a

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.300 
alcohol stoves that I've started using a
peer<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.170> definitely<00:03:52.709> need<00:03:52.860> some<00:03:53.070> type<00:03:53.280> of

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
peer to definitely need some type of

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.860 
peer to definitely need some type of
wind<00:03:53.610> protection<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:54.269> allow<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.540> your

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
wind protection to allow for your

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.289 
wind protection to allow for your
greater<00:03:55.560> heat<00:03:55.799> output<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.790> other<00:03:56.940> one<00:03:57.150> is

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
greater heat output and the other one is

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.490 
greater heat output and the other one is
a<00:03:57.530> recovering<00:03:58.530> cap<00:03:59.280> for<00:04:00.000> your<00:04:00.180> fuel<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.780> this

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
a recovering cap for your fuel and this

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.440 
a recovering cap for your fuel and this
allows<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.310> not<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> touch<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.180> fuel

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
allows you to not have to touch the fuel

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.440 
allows you to not have to touch the fuel
in<00:04:03.750> any<00:04:03.900> way<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.890> would<00:04:05.280> stick<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.850> actually

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
in any way you would stick this actually

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.009 
in any way you would stick this actually
in<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:08.030> cup<00:04:09.030> here<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.660> would<00:04:09.780> actually

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
in the cup here and you would actually

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.360 
in the cup here and you would actually
have<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.380> your<00:04:10.530> fuel<00:04:10.709> body<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.160> squeeze

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
have this on your fuel body and squeeze

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.500 
have this on your fuel body and squeeze
the<00:04:11.489> fuel<00:04:11.670> bottle<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.090> obviously<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the fuel bottle and obviously the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.900 
the fuel bottle and obviously the
suction<00:04:12.930> sucks<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.290> fuel<00:04:13.470> back<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:13.910> me

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
suction sucks to fuel back in me

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.479 
suction sucks to fuel back in me
personally<00:04:15.510> once<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.470> cool<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:17.070> seems<00:04:17.400> to

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
personally once this is cool it seems to

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.949 
personally once this is cool it seems to
be<00:04:17.609> easier<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:17.880> pour<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.390> right<00:04:18.539> into<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
be easier just pour this right into the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.340 
be easier just pour this right into the
fuel

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
fuel

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.860 
fuel
so<00:04:20.190> these<00:04:20.730> are<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:20.970> major<00:04:21.150> components<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
so these are the major components of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.610 
so these are the major components of
your<00:04:22.790> pack<00:04:23.790> of<00:04:23.970> feather<00:04:24.150> XL<00:04:24.630> stove<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.380> let's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
your pack of feather XL stove so let's

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.200 
your pack of feather XL stove so let's
do<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> burn<00:04:26.040> test<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.520> let's<00:04:26.670> just<00:04:26.850> see<00:04:27.000> how

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
do a burn test and let's just see how

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.540 
do a burn test and let's just see how
well<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.260> does

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.610
