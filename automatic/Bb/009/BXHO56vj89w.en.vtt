00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.649
 trailer 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.390
 The most important thing in the business is 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.800
 honesty bribery blackmail 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.640

 world and there are two possibilities 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.260
 either one is someone says the man 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.260
 is nobody 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.010
 We understand that America's national enemy 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.420
 Number one is dead 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.830
 my company sells a product of that 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.780
 competition can only dream 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.710
 and at a much lower price 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.260
 He really shakes the world 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.730
 judge attorneys purchase politicians if 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.840
 would stop my drug smuggling 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.840
 like 100,000 people unemployed 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.580
 my investigations point to it 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.670
 that frank lukaszentrum business over 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.620
 the mafia stands for the substance 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.210
 directly across a source in southeast asia 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.170
 he omits the middlemen and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.330
 closes over the US American 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.790
 military and verschnitte of heroin in 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.660
 the united states a 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.100
 Never has a fucking nigger 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.940
 made from the american mafia 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 failed in 100 years 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.460
 we have a problem we can do anywhere 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.460
 hiding fresh and running away is 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.660
 this is my home here i have mine 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.370
 business woman my mother my family

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.710
 order must be gone as any 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.780
 Human life is breathing 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.140
 i swear i pull my creak and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.140
 power 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.220
 they tried my way and too 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.319
 bring 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.540
 harlem is my revier i was for all 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.540
 there and now everything is there for me 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.349
 frank Lukas is the most dangerous human 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.349
 walking through the streets of our city 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.170
 Gangster is also a movie with 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.300
 incredible run length two and a half 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 hours is this film and that is 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.520
 first directly the great gangster 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.250
 you just do not notice the time 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.630
 history is staged so enthralling and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.180
 you just have to say that is god 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.290
 if he does it right , he just has it 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.330
 still a really fine hand 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.099
 for great movies because the two and a half 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.470
 Hours pass by in flight 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.599
 staged great duel you have that too 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.090
 feeling that cut perfectly in the sense 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.220
 namely before you are always felt exactly 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.720
 at the right time in the right place 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.670
 So you know that when I have one 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.989
 movies looks that he realizes ok god that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.150
 is just exciting what would happen now 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.140
 just do the opposite and as 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.790
 if he were to read the next one would read 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.980
 play to another location so that 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.310
 you always somehow at the height and is 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.569
 wow wow that is just extremely exciting 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.330
 the acting performance of 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.970
 denzel washington towering both 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.489
 make your thing extremely strong so that 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.340
 is really the very best and what 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.950
 i especially like that too 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.840
 duel against each other not always am 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.890
 same place is executed together 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.290
 but you also fight 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.540
 different places in the distance 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.040
 against the opponent and these are the things 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.750
 I also have horror movies 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.459
 said one should not always be evil 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.959
 see here they do not always have to 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.000
 be at eye level and always somehow 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.739
 Dead shoot 40 times and how does it work 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.160
 not exactly that's what makes the movie 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.690
 exciting that you know that's okay 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.280
 now different places where 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.930
 just something happens and still 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.380
 they are actually fighting face to face 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.750
 facebook 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.580
 the dialogues are actually more 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.080
 as well as there are such a few 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.940
 that is why it is actually this 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.380
 There are a couple of places you can tell 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.020
 Okay, we have to do it somehow 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.430
 jump into this cliche breach the 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.500
 is already gangster movies is about 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.910
 drugs lancelot must be again 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.680
 typical hard face sometimes 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.570
 but still somehow stays 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.820
 charming there is in this film 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.350
 nevertheless it is quite critical now 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.320
 Make sure that American gangster 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.050
 but timeless masterpiece is but whether 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.780
 the score is the machart cut 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.950
 Overall, the script is really more than 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.419
 solid one or the other 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.620
 conventional place would be one 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.390
 can save 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.979
 and I do not want to go there just because of that 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.460
 she's on a true story 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.949
 he still fictional 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.350
 worked out but really Saustark 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.000
 I can recommend you more than film 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.599
 and he gets 8 out of 10 points from me 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.130
 I really like this movie and it's exciting 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.110
 you ask me the question something like that 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.120
 something like that can happen 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.620
