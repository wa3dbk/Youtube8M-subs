00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.250
 yes there she goes to the door to a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 new adventure from the home whitepaper 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.920
 games peter we both got together 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.850
 watched 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.220
 yes to say we do not have it now 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.020
 tested thoroughly because you know that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 countless people come to steam every day 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
 play out but that looks interesting 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.680
 and we want a little one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 give an overview of what you are doing in the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.710
 based his ego adventure you could do it 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 to this growing genre of the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 So exploration games include one runs 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 rum 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 you look up objects to take for him 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.809
 notes and now and then you can also 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.379
 few puzzles but they are quite simple 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 held 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.320
 you always have only one object the more 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.879
 you can always take it with you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 take another take away 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.149
 want and what the whole interesting 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 just makes the story 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:04.470
 it's about being in the memory 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.630
 a patient invades and there 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 somehow a disease has to heal 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.510
 everything quite mysterious he created that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 reminds me of completely different games 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.479
 the memories of ancestors or of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 someone else than that a script it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.020
 is also so similar you rise in too 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.330
 one in the sense of animus and konstantin 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.689
 into this past world, so to speak 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.240
 in this dream world so to speak so here 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.490
 we see him now with city ​​on 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 You actually sound like that 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.680
 nothing is just about it and solves 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.689
 these few puzzles are going on like this 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.340
 little bit more about the psyche of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.149
 I have patients in any case 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 Roger that 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.850
 All this has that kind of art I say 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 the artistic claim is so much more 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.659
 what did not matter so the game counted 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.909
 not just something okay that's the story 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.460
 that is so and so black and white good 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.790
 and evil but that many themselves 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.690
 open up it is also partly a 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.240
 quite strange atmosphere so allah 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.979
 I'm all alone in this world and 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.570
 it could be the one thing at any moment 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.590
 Corner come so you have the feeling also 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.860
 sometimes more often and well you have to 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.870
 of course, everything search everything 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.180
 there are little hints everywhere 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.250
 and that makes the whole game 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.230
 interesting also the graphics like now 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.050
 Here she looks great on the sea 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.590
 background and yes of indie game looks 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.940
 very beautiful in this way always 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 so a little something has this off 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.050
 washed-out are washed-out textures 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.430
 so and even here the notes 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.430
 Display of the looks like that too 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.420
 little bit like a sun stop 0 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.370
 action so please do not expect that and 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.020
 but for a soundtrack just the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.010
 classic and the atmosphere is whole 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.360
 pretty yes who just times I believe it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.400
 it's not for people right now 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.840
 definitely an action game or something 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.130
 have a point click adventure or something 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 Just want something different 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.290
 yes, so to speak, a sandbox moderate game where 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.510
 you can walk around where you have everything 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.519
 can discover where you partly 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.410
 Take items with you was always sick 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.610
 only one but here is now too 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.450
 example a hidden note on 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.670
 this plate 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.630
 So you really have to do everything exactly 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.790
 look at 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.299
 the thing is synonymous with oculus rift as 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.070
 oculus rift ready and you can also with 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.900
 play gamepad so with gamepad it is 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.819
 also very pleasant to play 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.049
 from the control ago what me 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.939
 it's just that 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.370
 speed of movement of the hero 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.040
 feels very tough and I think so 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.140
 that's easy with while in the game 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.150
 built in that you just the same 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.840
 kind of slow exploration has 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.260
 but it feels a bit strange 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.450
 on 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.280
 However, this is true but 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.859
 Nonetheless , it's actually one 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.340
 Super game also makes you more fun the more you do 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.329
 comes in the game and for 16 euro 99 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.700
