movement would give Floyd drop I've
always<00:01:48.120> thought<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:48.680> South<00:01:49.680> paw<00:01:49.890> stance<00:01:49.920> is

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
always thought that South paw stance is

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.300 
always thought that South paw stance is
a<00:01:51.480> great<00:01:51.750> employee<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:52.710> he<00:01:52.860> does<00:01:53.070> dip

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
a great employee because he does dip

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.450 
a great employee because he does dip
into<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.970> southpaw<00:01:54.240> power<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.250> he's<00:01:56.250> dead

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
into the southpaw power and he's dead

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.430

I<00:01:58.590> counting<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> couple<00:01:59.250> times<00:01:59.400> got<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> couple

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I counting a couple times got a couple

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
I counting a couple times got a couple
tower<00:02:00.120> pots<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.050> mean<00:02:01.470> he<00:02:01.620> you<00:02:02.010> know<00:02:02.100> he

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
tower pots so I mean he you know he

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.950 
tower pots so I mean he you know he
doesn't<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.330> fight<00:02:03.510> shout<00:02:03.750> buzz

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
doesn't really like to fight shout buzz

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.780 
doesn't really like to fight shout buzz
but<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.940> know<00:02:06.030> he's<00:02:06.510> out<00:02:07.790> a

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
but the thing is you know he's out a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.790 
but the thing is you know he's out a
couple<00:02:09.030> height<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.509> forth<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.500> think

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
couple height so forth because I think

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.730 
couple height so forth because I think
he<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.390> knowing<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.570> he<00:02:12.870> needs<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.560> an

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
exact count because you know I think he

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.510 
exact count because you know I think he
got<00:02:16.410> embarrassed<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:17.010> there<00:02:17.130> taking<00:02:17.430> this
