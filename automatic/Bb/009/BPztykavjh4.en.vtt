00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.010

 information is the links here around 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.750
 Beauty screen 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 we started with manga and the show that is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 being reissued by jvc in an edition of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.829
 luxury first point I'm very fan of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 rock show is my favorite anime like this 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 of all time I watched when it was 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 little on tv headline 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.840
 after a while on the band and well after 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.510
 in my early twenties when 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.309
 I was in college, I resisted all 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 hundred episodes of anime and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.059
 I liked the way it was when I was a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 only child who had never read the manga 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.670
 and it was really cool to miss the river 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 sucuriÃº and stir it there beat in all 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 world is winning the galley at school 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
 This unique mandate already there where the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.369
 protagonist dies on the front page 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 best look that unusual thing good that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.290
 first volume it does not show what it is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 and pulled the plot is quite simple the bone 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.070
 who dies on the first page and he goes 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.320
 try to prove to the spiritual world 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.509
 that he is worthy of resurrection but not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.340
 There is nothing fantastic here 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 first volume is so in the zone in my 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.329
 Yes, say yes, follow the same course. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.829
 that it animates there in the next editions that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.630
 that will really be nice when 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.939
 arrive at the tournament of darkness in you 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.320
 You'll see what it is and the show I bought. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.790
 also the same the first two 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.799
 volumes of the historic collection of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 avengers that would be more or less a 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.479
 The panini damage saga would be a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.950
 more dry saga of damage in the when 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.909
 left in April came out with much more 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.590
 editions here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.869
 here they cut a lot I already read 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.240
 the first volume is clear that the magath 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.060
 so hyper from the table is from the beginning of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.399
 70 but I enjoy so is worth operates 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.080
 the dialogs of the urge are not so 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.390
 tiring as well as 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.890
 how normal these vacancies are from that time and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.450
 It was legal right to know 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.710
 a little more tango that finally goes 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420
 appear in the next movies the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.340
 Avengers here would be the first 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.740
 His appearances I bought is also 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.900
 bound to be the end of the phase of 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.430
 df lenir by animal man first 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.350
 Congratulations to pauline 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 so choice of cover in this house is 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.790
 so perfect out there if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.370
 was another cover of rafael albuquerque 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 but this one is part of df's own 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
 and myrna I think this stage here as 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.870
 A whole was great. 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.060
 the leomir guy can not speak emir is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190
 very strange, this word I preferred 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.730
 I know the right is df lenir but already 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.100
 I said mayer sova much better k at last 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 of the writer by the animal I 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.740
 I think it's cool. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.020
 only I expected more if you know final 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.510
 something more unusual something more inventive 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.340
 even because I really like them 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.770
 not to mention that it creates if a tip 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.620
 absurd at the end of the magazine and does not date 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.600
 she knows but it was worth reading the 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.010
 stage as a whole had fun utah was 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.110
 cool I also bought the fifth volume 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.000
 of the village and eternal that playing it cool 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.080
 and also the two volumes that make up the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.610
 war of the rings 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.980
 I have not had time to read these here. 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.290
 but it is one of the very well acclaimed 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.910
 criticism and I have a friend who 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.560
 he 's a freak so here he likes 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.690
 green screen he comments that it is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.459
 too soon as john is up 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380
 level it tastes good then I 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.269
 I believe in his opinion if I have 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.250
 time of law only that in this life I 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.720
 I do a beauty video I also bought the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.470
 second marsh monster volume 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.019
 love 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.910
 I preferred the first volume but this one 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.410
 I still think it's cool so it's not in the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.019
 same level as the first but it's cool 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 like tata creating something really cool so 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.340
 Punk promotion you can not really see that 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.810
 he is gradually giving evidence of 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
 that the monster plant will become something 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.860
 much bigger, actually I already know that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.810
 because inep the most current stories 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 hands of hard bread but it is nice because it 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.440
 slowly sewing this larger plot 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.090
 I do not ask you here, man. 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.650
 Repent so will hate you for not 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.420
 have bought shows how much the number 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.160
 It was to finalize the video I bought the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.660
 simcity the yellow killer who is a 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.790
 reissue of becoming 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.720
 I already had the previous version as a 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.600
 another cover 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.790
 only those incarnated to come with time 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.850
 also the several that I bought them 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 Pick the spine here so I'm done. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.480
 buying for I think so if a 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.580
 series b 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.080
 worth even on the shelf so more 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.670
 a newer edition were if not me 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.920
 deception and three editions of sin city 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.690
 mine that took off the cover and my 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.640
 autuori options also so let's 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.380
 hope that he has run away from this 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.760
 problem in this issue or whatever they have 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.760

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.170
 I speak, I say I'm eating the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.610

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.380

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.250

 about comics bought in amazon but 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.430
 in the part of the national comics I 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.860
 I really enjoyed the second volume of sec 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.560
 and oppress a volume 4 ac of stories 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.270

 good and look that was very good is the two 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.430
