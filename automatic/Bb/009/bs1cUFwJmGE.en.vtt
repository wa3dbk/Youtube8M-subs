00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.840> going<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.050> be<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> quick<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.560> on<00:00:02.010> the

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
this is going to be a quick video on the

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.980 
this is going to be a quick video on the
temperatures<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.170> noise<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.950> radion

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
temperatures and noise of the radion

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.870 
temperatures and noise of the radion
6870<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.470> I've<00:00:07.620> got<00:00:07.859> my<00:00:08.040> handy<00:00:08.460> dandy<00:00:08.610> little

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
6870 so I've got my handy dandy little

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.730 
6870 so I've got my handy dandy little
thermometer<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.870> showing<00:00:10.230> us<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.530> room

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
thermometer here showing us the room

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860 
thermometer here showing us the room
temps<00:00:11.130> because<00:00:11.460> remember<00:00:11.730> if<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.690> room

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
temps because remember if the room

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.930 
temps because remember if the room
temperatures<00:00:13.380> go<00:00:13.590> up<00:00:13.620> by<00:00:14.040> even<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.490> degree

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
temperatures go up by even one degree

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.390 
temperatures go up by even one degree
then<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.929> card<00:00:16.230> temperatures<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.070> up<00:00:17.100> by

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
then the card temperatures will go up by

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
then the card temperatures will go up by
exactly<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.240> degree<00:00:18.600> those<00:00:18.930> are<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> rules

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
exactly one degree those are the rules

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
exactly one degree those are the rules
they<00:00:19.740> must<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.130> obeyed<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.060> whenever<00:00:21.510> you're

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
they must be obeyed so whenever you're

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.480 
they must be obeyed so whenever you're
comparing<00:00:22.170> temperatures<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.070> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
comparing temperatures you have to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910 
comparing temperatures you have to
remember<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.470> ambient

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
remember you have to know the ambient

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560 
remember you have to know the ambient
temperature<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.670> here<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.480> have

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
temperature so here you can see we have

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
temperature so here you can see we have
a<00:00:27.599> 41<00:00:28.140> degree<00:00:28.500> idle<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> 22<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> half<00:00:31.700> 22

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
a 41 degree idle at a 22 and a half 22

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.790 
a 41 degree idle at a 22 and a half 22
to<00:00:33.030> 23<00:00:33.360> degree<00:00:33.930> room<00:00:34.110> temperature<00:00:34.620> we're

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
to 23 degree room temperature we're

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.870 
to 23 degree room temperature we're
going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> treat<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.340> sort<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.670> plus

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
going to treat this as sort of plus

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
going to treat this as sort of plus
minus<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> mean<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.780> how<00:00:36.809> sensitive<00:00:37.260> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
minus one I mean look how sensitive this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.069 
minus one I mean look how sensitive this
thing<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.430> put<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.850> hand<00:00:39.149> next<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
thing is if I put my hand next to the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
thing is if I put my hand next to the
probe<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.829> watch<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.700> temperature

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
probe over here watch the temperature

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.450 
probe over here watch the temperature
skyrocket<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.590> from<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> heat<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> hands

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
skyrocket just from the heat my hands

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.799 
skyrocket just from the heat my hands
giving<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.180> even<00:00:45.390> touching<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
giving off I'm not even touching the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.020 
giving off I'm not even touching the
thing<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.829> crazy<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.430> got<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> sort<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
thing pretty crazy so you got to sort of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
thing pretty crazy so you got to sort of
see<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.719> already<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.079> like

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
see look at that it's already up to like

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
see look at that it's already up to like
25<00:00:49.739> degrees<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> heat<00:00:50.940> from

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
25 degrees just because of the heat from

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.080 
25 degrees just because of the heat from
my<00:00:51.210> hand<00:00:51.420> anyway<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.949> idle

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.910 

it's<00:00:57.090> basically<00:00:57.809> silent<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.649> idle<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it's basically silent at idle it's got a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.850 
it's basically silent at idle it's got a
little<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> fan<00:01:04.199> normal

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little bit of a little bit of fan normal

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit of a little bit of fan normal
fan<00:01:05.129> sort<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> grinding<00:01:06.270> noise<00:01:06.330> within

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
fan sort of a grinding noise within

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
fan sort of a grinding noise within
probably<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:07.920> 12<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.549> 14<00:01:08.939> inches<00:01:09.060> but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
probably about 12 to 14 inches but

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
probably about 12 to 14 inches but
beyond<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.619> especially<00:01:10.890> inside<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
beyond that and especially inside a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
beyond that and especially inside a
closed<00:01:11.670> case<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.630> hear<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.260> thing

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
closed case you will not hear this thing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.700 
closed case you will not hear this thing
so<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> 41<00:01:14.549> degree<00:01:14.820> idle<00:01:15.119> silent<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.259> let's<00:01:16.530> see

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so a 41 degree idle silent now let's see

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
so a 41 degree idle silent now let's see
what<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> looks<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.369> under<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> gaming<00:01:18.150> load

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
what it looks like under a gaming load

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
what it looks like under a gaming load
now<00:01:18.810> we've<00:01:19.020> got<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.500> represent<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
now we've got what would represent a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
now we've got what would represent a
worst<00:01:20.520> case<00:01:20.729> scenario<00:01:20.939> gaming<00:01:21.840> load<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
worst case scenario gaming load so you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
worst case scenario gaming load so you
can<00:01:22.590> see<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> room<00:01:23.009> temperatures<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
can see the room temperatures here and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.240 
can see the room temperatures here and
you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> running<00:01:25.380> fur<00:01:25.710> mark<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you can see that running fur mark in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
you can see that running fur mark in
extreme<00:01:26.700> burn<00:01:27.000> mode<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.049> yield<00:01:28.320> an

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
extreme burn mode is going to yield an

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.969 
extreme burn mode is going to yield an
83<00:01:29.430> degree<00:01:29.729> temperature<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.439> also<00:01:31.590> see

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
83 degree temperature you can also see

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.319 
83 degree temperature you can also see
that<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> whoops<00:01:34.310> fan<00:01:35.310> speed<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.880> ramped<00:01:36.270> up

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that the whoops fan speed has ramped up

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.620 
that the whoops fan speed has ramped up
a<00:01:36.479> fair<00:01:36.689> bit<00:01:36.869> Wow<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.770> much<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.100> all

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
a fair bit Wow not really much at all

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
a fair bit Wow not really much at all
that's<00:01:40.490> incredible<00:01:41.490> oh<00:01:42.200> wait<00:01:43.200> no<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.649> it's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's incredible oh wait no it has it's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's incredible oh wait no it has it's
just<00:01:44.009> not<00:01:44.280> detected<00:01:44.700> by<00:01:44.729> afterburner<00:01:45.240> okay<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just not detected by afterburner okay so

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.880 
just not detected by afterburner okay so
you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.780> listen

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
you can listen

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.040 
you can listen
you<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.640> compare<00:01:48.940> those<00:01:49.090> two<00:01:49.360> clips<00:01:49.570> against

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
you can compare those two clips against

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.380 
you can compare those two clips against
each<00:01:50.170> other<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.430> quite<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> bit<00:01:52.180> louder

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
each other so it is quite a bit louder

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.050 
each other so it is quite a bit louder
but<00:01:52.659> still<00:01:52.900> quite<00:01:53.140> tolerable<00:01:53.890> especially<00:01:54.820> for

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
but still quite tolerable especially for

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.730 
but still quite tolerable especially for
like<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> performance<00:01:56.050> like<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.320> mid-range

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
like a performance like a mid-range

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.800 
like a performance like a mid-range
performance<00:01:57.430> graphics<00:01:57.700> card<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.270> I'm<00:01:58.630> going

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
performance graphics card so I'm going

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.960 
performance graphics card so I'm going
to<00:01:58.869> give<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.229> just<00:02:00.070> some<00:02:00.190> comparisons

to give you just some comparisons

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.710 
to give you just some comparisons
against<00:02:01.510> the<00:02:01.780> GTX<00:02:02.560> 480<00:02:06.150> there's<00:02:07.150> full<00:02:07.450> speed

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
against the GTX 480 there's full speed

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.419 
against the GTX 480 there's full speed
in<00:02:07.900> case<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.229> were<00:02:08.350> wondering<00:02:08.770> but<00:02:09.220> I'm<00:02:09.310> going

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
in case you were wondering but I'm going

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.919 
in case you were wondering but I'm going
to<00:02:09.459> give<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.700> some<00:02:09.880> comparisons<00:02:10.479> against<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
to give you some comparisons against the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.890 
to give you some comparisons against the
GTX<00:02:11.350> 480<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.890> well<00:02:12.100> as<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.400> 5870<00:02:13.240> just<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:13.810> you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
GTX 480 as well as the 5870 just so you

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.979 
GTX 480 as well as the 5870 just so you
got<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> reference<00:02:14.530> point<00:02:14.850> here's<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.060> 58<00:02:16.510> 70

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
got a reference point here's the 58 70

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.280 
got a reference point here's the 58 70
for<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.230> noise<00:02:17.440> comparison<00:02:18.959> get<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.080> nice<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
for my noise comparison get it nice and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.910 
for my noise comparison get it nice and
close<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.920> fat<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.840> 58<00:02:23.320> 70<00:02:23.739> is

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
close to the fat now the 58 70 is

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.340 
close to the fat now the 58 70 is
attached<00:02:24.370> louder<00:02:24.670> than<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> 68<00:02:25.600> 70<00:02:26.050> at<00:02:26.140> least

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
attached louder than the 68 70 at least

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.340 
attached louder than the 68 70 at least
for<00:02:26.650> my<00:02:26.890> particular<00:02:27.340> samples<00:02:27.940> um<00:02:28.720> one<00:02:29.320> thing

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
for my particular samples um one thing

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.970 
for my particular samples um one thing
that<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:30.239> mean<00:02:31.239> those<00:02:31.420> fans<00:02:31.720> look<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.290> similar

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
that I mean those fans look so similar

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.640 
that I mean those fans look so similar
but<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.640> almost<00:02:33.910> looks<00:02:34.480> like<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.989> new<00:02:35.170> fan<00:02:35.470> is

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
but it almost looks like the new fan is

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.810 
but it almost looks like the new fan is
a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.040> bigger<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.580> what<00:02:36.730> I'm

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
a little bit bigger you know what I'm

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.660 
a little bit bigger you know what I'm
going<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.030> compare<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.650> justice<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.800> know<00:02:39.459> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
going to compare that justice I know the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.400 
going to compare that justice I know the
fan<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:39.970> exactly<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.510> same<00:02:40.690> diameter<00:02:41.230> for

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
fan is exactly the same diameter for

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
fan is exactly the same diameter for
some<00:02:41.560> reason<00:02:41.890> there's<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.100> little<00:02:42.280> bit<00:02:42.400> more

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
some reason there's a little bit more

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.949 
some reason there's a little bit more
word<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> could<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.930> that

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
word to this one it could just be that

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.960 
word to this one it could just be that
it's<00:02:44.230> older<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> bit<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.430> an<00:02:45.519> older<00:02:45.730> card

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
it's older it is a bit of an older card

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.790 
it's older it is a bit of an older card
so<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.600> see<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.989> my<00:02:47.080> idle<00:02:47.380> temps<00:02:47.680> on

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
so you can see that my idle temps on

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.920 
so you can see that my idle temps on
this<00:02:47.980> particular<00:02:48.489> card<00:02:48.760> are<00:02:48.970> 38<00:02:49.480> degrees

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
this particular card are 38 degrees

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.900 
this particular card are 38 degrees
place<00:02:50.920> you'd<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.220> able<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.400> see<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.670> if<00:02:51.820> my

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
place you'd be able to see that if my

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.610 
place you'd be able to see that if my
camera<00:02:52.239> could<00:02:52.390> focus<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.930> monitor<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
camera could focus on a monitor for a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.100 
camera could focus on a monitor for a
change<00:02:53.970> maybe<00:02:54.970> that'll<00:02:55.209> help<00:02:55.239> there<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.959> go

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
change maybe that'll help there you go

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.039 
change maybe that'll help there you go
39<00:02:56.709> degrees<00:02:57.040> 38<00:02:57.489> degrees<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:58.660> my<00:02:58.840> room

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
39 degrees 38 degrees and then my room

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.960 
39 degrees 38 degrees and then my room
temps<00:02:59.440> are<00:02:59.670> around<00:03:00.670> 20<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:02.190> 23<00:03:03.190> degrees<00:03:03.370> so

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
temps are around 20 to 23 degrees so

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.900 
temps are around 20 to 23 degrees so
there<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.209> go<00:03:04.470> now<00:03:05.470> we'll<00:03:05.709> ramp<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.160> up<00:03:06.250> now

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
there you go now we'll ramp it up now

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.310 
there you go now we'll ramp it up now
bearing<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.329> mind<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.600> this<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.019> more

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
bearing in mind that this is a more

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.310 
bearing in mind that this is a more
powerful<00:03:08.470> card

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
powerful card

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.770 
powerful card

the<00:03:13.260> noise<00:03:13.470> level<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:13.980> quite<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.490> louder

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the noise level is quite a bit louder

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.520 
the noise level is quite a bit louder
and<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.030> does<00:03:15.210> get<00:03:15.510> hotter<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.170> runs<00:03:16.320> at

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and it does get hotter so it runs at

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.410 
and it does get hotter so it runs at
about<00:03:16.590> 90<00:03:17.040> degrees<00:03:17.070> using<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> default<00:03:18.210> fan

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
about 90 degrees using the default fan

about 90 degrees using the default fan
profile<00:03:18.990> remember<00:03:19.350> with<00:03:19.440> afterburner<00:03:19.860> you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.400 
profile remember with afterburner you

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
can always change profiles around if you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.140 
can always change profiles around if you
want<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> can<00:03:23.580> see<00:03:23.730> we're<00:03:23.850> running<00:03:24.060> at

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
want so you can see we're running at

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.340 
want so you can see we're running at
about<00:03:24.330> 44<00:03:24.810> percent<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.380> fan<00:03:25.650> speed<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:27.350> 87

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
about 44 percent on the fan speed and 87

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.050 
about 44 percent on the fan speed and 87
degrees<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> GPU<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.640> already<00:03:29.730> set

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
degrees on the GPU I think I already set

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.490 
degrees on the GPU I think I already set
that<00:03:30.240> yeah<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.450> already<00:03:30.570> said<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.410> I'm

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that yeah I already said that so I'm

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.930 
that yeah I already said that so I'm
just<00:03:31.530> going<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:31.770> show<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.310> for<00:03:32.430> context

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
just going to show you just for context

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.760 
just going to show you just for context
so<00:03:33.000> remember<00:03:33.330> fur<00:03:33.690> mark<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.050> pretty<00:03:34.410> much<00:03:34.560> a

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
so remember fur mark is pretty much a

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.290 
so remember fur mark is pretty much a
worst<00:03:35.370> case<00:03:35.760> scenario<00:03:36.210> for<00:03:37.020> a<00:03:37.050> game<00:03:37.350> running

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
worst case scenario for a game running

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.210 
worst case scenario for a game running
like<00:03:39.300> absolute<00:03:40.260> worst<00:03:40.440> case<00:03:40.680> scenario<00:03:41.100> it

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
like absolute worst case scenario it

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.470 
like absolute worst case scenario it
won't<00:03:41.400> get<00:03:41.520> this<00:03:41.670> hot<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.030> won't<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.300> this

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
won't get this hot it won't get this

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.050 
won't get this hot it won't get this
loud<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:43.050> any<00:03:43.500> sort<00:03:43.740> of<00:03:43.860> real<00:03:44.040> game<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.520> this

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
loud in any sort of real game and this

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.940 
loud in any sort of real game and this
is<00:03:45.480> only<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.900> set<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.200> manually<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:46.860> I'm

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
is only if you set it manually but I'm

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.140 
is only if you set it manually but I'm
going<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.130> go<00:03:47.220> ahead<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.490> turn<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.700> up<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.790> 100%

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
going to go ahead and turn it up to 100%

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.640 
going to go ahead and turn it up to 100%
to<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.369 

there<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.769> go<00:03:57.920> okay<00:03:58.959> moving<00:03:59.959> on

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
there you go okay moving on

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.559 
there you go okay moving on
and<00:04:00.470> finally<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.459> comparison<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.180> had<00:04:02.390> the

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
and finally for comparison we had the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.789 
and finally for comparison we had the
GTX<00:04:03.140> 480<00:04:03.860> which<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.760> in<00:04:05.329> some<00:04:06.019> ways<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.590> top

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
GTX 480 which is in some ways the top

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.119 
GTX 480 which is in some ways the top
dog<00:04:07.099> in<00:04:07.129> terms<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:08.019> noise<00:04:09.019> generation<00:04:09.799> due<00:04:10.099> to

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
dog in terms of noise generation due to

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.270 
dog in terms of noise generation due to
the<00:04:10.519> power<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.030> size<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.689> the<00:04:12.170> GPU<00:04:12.530> inside<00:04:13.099> it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
the power and size of the GPU inside it

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.339 
the power and size of the GPU inside it
so<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.790> can<00:04:13.940> see<00:04:14.150> our<00:04:14.239> idle<00:04:14.510> temperatures<00:04:15.079> are

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
so you can see our idle temperatures are

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.379 
so you can see our idle temperatures are
a<00:04:15.379> little<00:04:15.709> bit<00:04:15.829> higher<00:04:16.070> than<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.150> other<00:04:17.269> two

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
a little bit higher than the other two

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.060 
a little bit higher than the other two
cards<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.049> we<00:04:18.139> were<00:04:18.169> looking<00:04:18.410> at<00:04:18.709> at<00:04:18.889> about

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
cards that we were looking at at about

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.699 
cards that we were looking at at about
50<00:04:19.579> degrees<00:04:19.910> my<00:04:20.180> room<00:04:20.389> temps<00:04:20.780> just<00:04:20.959> for<00:04:21.590> your

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
50 degrees my room temps just for your

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.400 
50 degrees my room temps just for your
reference<00:04:21.739> are<00:04:22.539> around<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.630> same<00:04:23.840> they're<00:04:24.080> 23

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
reference are around the same they're 23

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.640 
reference are around the same they're 23
and<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.740> half<00:04:24.770> degrees<00:04:25.340> okay<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:26.660> in

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
and a half degrees okay and then in

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.330 
and a half degrees okay and then in
terms<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.070> fan<00:04:28.280> noise<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.770> see<00:04:30.949> that<00:04:31.100> fans

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
terms of fan noise you can see that fans

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.150 
terms of fan noise you can see that fans
barely<00:04:31.789> spinning<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.300> mean<00:04:32.419> look<00:04:32.539> at<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:33.160> it's

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
barely spinning I mean look at this it's

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.610 
barely spinning I mean look at this it's
not<00:04:34.220> going<00:04:34.460> very<00:04:34.669> fast<00:04:34.940> at<00:04:35.180> all<00:04:35.240> this<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.410> quite

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
not going very fast at all this is quite

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.279 
not going very fast at all this is quite
a<00:04:36.740> quiet<00:04:37.160> card<00:04:37.669> at<00:04:37.910> idle<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.050> bit<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.229> a

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
a quiet card at idle but it's a bit of a

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.040 
a quiet card at idle but it's a bit of a
different<00:04:39.590> story<00:04:39.800> under<00:04:40.430> load<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.449> our<00:04:41.600> GTX

different story under load so our GTX

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.920
