00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
and we are going to do a second boot and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.410 
and we are going to do a second boot and
get<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> OS<00:00:37.200> installed<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.280> SSD<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
get the OS installed on the SSD and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
get the OS installed on the SSD and
we're<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> little<00:00:41.010> bit<00:00:41.219> of

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we're going to do a little bit of

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.040 
we're going to do a little bit of
baseline<00:00:41.730> benchmarking<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> stock

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050

baseline benchmarking with the stock
cooler<00:00:43.230> own<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.329> some<00:00:45.780> of

cooler own just to kind of see some of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
cooler own just to kind of see some of
the<00:00:45.930> differences<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.649> temperatures<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the differences in temperatures that we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
the differences in temperatures that we
might<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:48.030> under<00:00:48.570> load<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.379> maybe

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
might get under load with you know maybe

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.310 
might get under load with you know maybe
some<00:00:49.770> white<00:00:49.950> 595<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> white<00:00:51.870> cluster

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
some white 595 with the white cluster

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220 
some white 595 with the white cluster
from<00:00:52.530> inter<00:00:52.890> Mac<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:54.090> anything<00:00:54.510> crazy

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
from inter Mac so not anything crazy

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
from inter Mac so not anything crazy
intense<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:56.910> baselines

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
intense just want to get some baselines

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
intense just want to get some baselines
and<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> inner<00:00:58.800> max<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> see

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and get the inner max on and just see

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.209 
and get the inner max on and just see
what<00:00:59.910> difference<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> makes<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:01.379> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> people

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
what difference it makes a lot of people

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
what difference it makes a lot of people
aren't<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.969> whether<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.719> will

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
aren't sure whether or not they will

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
aren't sure whether or not they will
need<00:01:04.080> an<00:01:04.619> aftermarket<00:01:05.070> cooler

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
need an aftermarket cooler

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
need an aftermarket cooler
most<00:01:05.909> people<00:01:06.180> say<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.659> overclocking

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
most people say for not overclocking

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
most people say for not overclocking
shouldn't<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> difference<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.909> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
shouldn't make the difference so just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:57.540 
shouldn't make the difference so just
going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> test<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.810> theory<00:01:10.110> out

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
all right so got everything hooked up

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.500 
all right so got everything hooked up

up have a thumb drive with Windows 8 for

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.070 
up have a thumb drive with Windows 8 for
a<00:02:09.619> streamline<00:02:10.100> OS<00:02:10.970> installation<00:02:11.420> hopefully

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
a streamline OS installation hopefully

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.300 
a streamline OS installation hopefully
that<00:02:12.230> goes<00:02:12.440> well<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:15.260> got<00:02:15.680> coffee<00:02:15.950> stuff

be putting this on later after I get

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.460 
be putting this on later after I get
some<00:02:25.760> initial<00:02:25.940> benchmarks<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.840> that's

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
some initial benchmarks and that's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.030 
some initial benchmarks and that's
everything<00:02:27.890> lots<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.460> towel<00:02:28.910> off<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.040> let's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
everything lots of towel off and let's

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.530 
everything lots of towel off and let's
uh<00:02:31.930> try<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.990> start<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.350> up<00:02:33.500> again<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.360> those

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
uh try to start this up again so those

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.449 
uh try to start this up again so those
you<00:02:35.690> he's<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.620> those<00:02:36.800> of<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> who<00:02:37.190> aren't

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
you he's so those of you who aren't

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.730 
you he's so those of you who aren't
familiar<00:02:37.610> with<00:02:38.600> turning<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.230> computer

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
familiar with turning one a computer

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.780 
familiar with turning one a computer
without<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:40.370> case<00:02:42.160> basically<00:02:43.160> if<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.520> look<00:02:43.670> at

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
without a case basically if you look at

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.370 
without a case basically if you look at
your<00:02:43.940> power<00:02:44.120> switch<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:44.510> hopefully<00:02:45.260> you

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
your power switch which hopefully you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.940 
your power switch which hopefully you
can<00:02:45.500> see<00:02:47.170> read<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:51.140> right<00:02:51.350> there<00:02:51.590> those

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
can see read that that right there those

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.190 
can see read that that right there those
two<00:02:51.980> pens<00:02:52.400> active<00:02:53.240> your<00:02:53.390> power<00:02:53.570> switch<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.080> if

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
two pens active your power switch so if

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.070 
two pens active your power switch so if
you<00:02:58.120> flipped<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.300> the<00:03:00.260> power<00:03:00.470> supply<00:03:00.680> first

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
you flipped on the power supply first

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.500 
you flipped on the power supply first
now<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.110> see<00:03:03.380> an<00:03:03.620> LED<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.550> you<00:03:04.790> short

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
now you see an LED and if you short

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.400 
now you see an LED and if you short

I'm gonna have to get a keyboard in a
second<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.519> just<00:03:21.550> want<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.849> make<00:03:21.940> sure<00:03:22.120> this

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
second I just want to make sure this

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
hopefully plug and play work so I don't

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
have to turn it back off in a way again

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.610 
have to turn it back off in a way again
but<00:03:33.700> be<00:03:34.390> back<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.690> second<00:03:35.019> perhaps<00:03:35.440> a

degrees with the same parameters going
and<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.810> also<00:04:31.960> use<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.470> CSS<00:04:32.770> real<00:04:33.160> bench<00:04:33.370> stress

and I also use a CSS real bench stress

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.909 
and I also use a CSS real bench stress
test<00:04:33.940> just<00:04:34.300> for<00:04:34.479> some<00:04:34.660> variety<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.410> then<00:04:35.710> ran<00:04:35.860> a

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.800 
test just for some variety I then ran a
few<00:04:36.250> short<00:04:36.550> benchmarks<00:04:37.360> which<00:04:37.510> you<00:04:37.599> guys<00:04:37.750> saw

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
few short benchmarks which you guys saw

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.200 
few short benchmarks which you guys saw
there<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.620> few<00:04:38.830> more<00:04:39.130> even<00:04:39.550> under<00:04:40.030> these

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
there and a few more even under these

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.089 
there and a few more even under these
conditions<00:04:40.750> with<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> stress<00:04:41.349> test<00:04:41.620> going

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.339 
conditions with the stress test going
now<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.430> did<00:04:42.669> this<00:04:42.820> both<00:04:43.180> with<00:04:43.450> a<00:04:43.510> lot<00:04:44.020> clock

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
now I did this both with a lot clock

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.980 
now I did this both with a lot clock
speed<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.650> 4.0<00:04:45.430> gigahertz<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.150> was<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.570> turbo

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
speed of 4.0 gigahertz and was the turbo

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.230 
speed of 4.0 gigahertz and was the turbo
on<00:04:47.229> and<00:04:47.950> as<00:04:48.099> you<00:04:48.220> would<00:04:48.310> expect<00:04:48.460> benchmarks

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
on and as you would expect benchmarks

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.790 
on and as you would expect benchmarks
were<00:04:49.510> very<00:04:49.780> close<00:04:49.990> with<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.289> lock<00:04:50.470> o'clock

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
were very close with the lock o'clock

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.920 
were very close with the lock o'clock
speed<00:04:51.130> but<00:04:51.580> did<00:04:51.789> show<00:04:52.030> some<00:04:52.240> variation<00:04:52.539> with

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
speed but did show some variation with

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.260 
speed but did show some variation with
the<00:04:53.050> turbo<00:04:53.470> turned<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.039> this<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.760> because<00:04:55.120> the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
the turbo turned on this is because the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.600 
the turbo turned on this is because the
aftermarket<00:04:55.690> cooler<00:04:56.020> can<00:04:56.740> help<00:04:57.010> make<00:04:57.190> sure<00:04:57.340> no

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
overclocking this guy and not too long

overclocking this guy and not too long
after<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.520> get<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.880> into<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.330> case<00:05:50.540> so<00:05:50.720> stay

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
after I get it into the case so stay

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.870 
after I get it into the case so stay
tuned<00:05:51.320> for<00:05:51.350> that<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:52.100> maybe<00:05:52.280> we<00:05:52.430> can<00:05:52.580> do<00:05:52.730> some

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
tuned for that and maybe we can do some
