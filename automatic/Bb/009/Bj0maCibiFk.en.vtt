00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 all beaver dear friends with you in india 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.839
 Today we have the 10 most interesting in my 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.420
 a look at the facts about fred perry 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.870
 so at number one we have a teaser 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 It was released on June 26, just the date that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 fnaf1 was listed in the history paper 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.510
 it was then that the first two were found 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
 killed the child may have some 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.279
 connection between fredber om and dead children 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 Do you think fact 2 on the teaser can 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.929
 see two mouths upper mouth obviously 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.600
 belongs to fredber bottom mouth 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
 belongs to the belly which is also 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 Treats like a pumpkin is possible 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 is a reference to the release date of this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 games that come out just for halloween 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 like think think only art 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.360
 add a new him to a friend about so and him 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 the pumpkin is pushed into the stomach with huge teeth 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.789
 That will be fun then the third fact is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.399
 The teaser has 2 hidden labels at once. 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.070
 then carries the left which is hidden in E and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.719
 I also have not yet revealed the phrase bro 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.359
 and what to me 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.280
 Personally, I guess that is to protect me 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.880
 that is , something supposedly a soul 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.159
 child asks for either a player or fredber 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.150
 to protect him, remember what the family is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 the timer and the first victim was killed exactly 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.820
 there was a fredber for him 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.310
 asks for help baby shower well how are we 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.680
 we know from this mini-game Fredber could not 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.960
 help the child because they were near 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.590
 children who screamed and how do we know 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.799
 fnaf 3 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.310
 animatronic can not escape screaming 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.950
 children 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.159
 Here is such a sad story under 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 the fourth fact is most likely 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.790
 fredber was in reflection on the previous 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.369
 teaser where on the floor could see 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.500
 someone's jaw maybe by the way what on 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.189
 the reflection is visible not even the mouth of Fredber 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.350
 and his belly is such a thing 5 fact 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.229
 contrary to the opinion of most fredber not 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.630
 black just for the whole picture 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.840
 besides the butterfly, a black and white filter is applied 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.260
 and also considering this we still haven't 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.390
 know what color Freddie himself 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.730
 maybe he is black as a shadow and motronic 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.800
 maybe he's golden like golden freddy 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.310
 well, maybe from a gray-brown-crimson nobody 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.590
 does not know 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.510
 6 fact if you look at the bow 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.940
 You may notice that the right falls 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.460
 reddish lighting on the left is falling 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 bluish well or bluish nazarik 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.830
 maybe you want it to show that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.970
 Freddy is standing next to a failure who does not have 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.330
 blue glow 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.950
 and also with freddie or foxy who have 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.300
 reddish lighting 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.950
 in other words, he is probably standing on the stage 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.440
 the seventh fact in different places freddie ri 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.480
 You can see the faces of different animatronics 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.190
 I argued that they are not our fruit 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.130
 imagination in this video and go 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.280
 look at the most notable of them 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.460
 puppet 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.590
 cupcake or foxy and also the muzzle on the left 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.020
 which some consider springtrap 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.990
 but i'm not sure yet actually individuals 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.090
 can see more but in those faces i'm not 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.459
 sure while these which i 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.800
 showed easy enough to see and 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.200
 consider such small ones 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.690
 Easter eggs from scott perhaps by the way this 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.390
 hints on the following teasers 8 fact 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.390
 fredber is the bear that 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.400
 was a family deiner maybe that means 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.459
 that in one of the nights we will work 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.280
 family diver and we will see as a maniac 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.780
 I killed a child and if I'm right and in the stomach 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.780
 he says protect me 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.940
 then maybe we will be like in fnaf 3 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.970
 be able to save this baby 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.010
 change the events of the game 9 fact given 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.850
 that Freddie is quite a lot of faces of others 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.500
 animatronics 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.560
 and also given the name of the previous 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.680
 teaser something big is coming 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.200
 suggest that fredber actually 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.330
 huge and he is a huge figure 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.060
 animatronics which stands on the roof 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.220
 pizzerias and invites visitors to both 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.489
 for example in the simpsons of huge figures 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.650
 huge donut boys more precisely then 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.750
 most likely a horrible version of it 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.459
 a huge figure because I doubt 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.769
 that such a terrible animatronic could 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.470
 make someone come to eat 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.959
 this restaurant and the last 10 fact 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.340
 fredber has two jaws also like 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.310
 animatronics from fnaf 2 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.810
 he also has a bow like that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.329
 freddy besides 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.209
 has buttons like freddy 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.850
 the truth is that Freddie has no holes 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.740
 and our Fredber has buttons with holes 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.350
 they also have similar tum 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.970
 but the difference in the buttons makes it possible 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.760
 some people assume it is on 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.480
 not really fredber bear fredber 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.970
 balun fight 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.090
 funny theory of course but I admit that 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.150
 maybe our fredber has some 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.340
 connection with that freddie for example maybe 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.889
 that when creating that freddie during fnaf 2 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.169
 the authors of the restaurant tried to maximize 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.750
 repeat the very first animatronic 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.090
 freddie ra but don't pay attention to 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.910
 holes in the corners well, who needs them and 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.970
 so animatronics came out similar but 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.070
 not clones but that's all dear friends 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.669
 I hope you enjoyed it bye bye 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.669
 good luck
