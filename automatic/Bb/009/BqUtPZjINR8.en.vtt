00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
my youtube channel we're going to take

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.529 
my youtube channel we're going to take
the<00:01:00.960> bullet<00:01:01.170> collars<00:01:01.710> we're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.149> solder

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the bullet collars we're going to solder

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.570 
the bullet collars we're going to solder
them<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> place<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.820> place<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:07.310> positive<00:01:08.310> end

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
them in place and place the positive end

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.630 
them in place and place the positive end
cap<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> take<00:01:11.610> your

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
cap on to it so when you go to take your

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
cap on to it so when you go to take your
battery<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.510> your<00:01:13.200> ESC<00:01:13.740> it'll<00:01:14.400> connect<00:01:15.299> just

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
battery and your ESC it'll connect just

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.130 
battery and your ESC it'll connect just
like<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.850> always<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.570> sure<00:01:18.600> when

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
like so you always want to be sure when

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
like so you always want to be sure when
you<00:01:19.170> connect<00:01:19.770> an<00:01:19.920> ESC<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.759> battery<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you connect an ESC to your battery that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.080 
you connect an ESC to your battery that
you<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.570> black<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.080> black<00:01:22.200> red<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.250> red<00:01:23.310> if

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you have black on black red on red if

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
you have black on black red on red if
you<00:01:24.509> do<00:01:25.200> reverse<00:01:25.850> Perel<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you do reverse Perel if you do the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.390 
you do reverse Perel if you do the
reverse<00:01:28.790> wiring<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.509> will<00:01:30.780> short<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.320> your

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
reverse wiring it will short out your

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.069 
reverse wiring it will short out your
thing<00:01:32.400> parity<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> word<00:01:33.930> I'm

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
thing parity I think it's the word I'm

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.039 
thing parity I think it's the word I'm
looking<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.680> odd<00:01:35.040> word<00:01:35.720> but<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.810> back

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
looking for is a odd word but now back

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.679 
looking for is a odd word but now back
for<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.380> motor<00:01:37.560> mount<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> brand<00:01:39.570> new

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
for the motor mount this is a brand new

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
for the motor mount this is a brand new
mode<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.200> show<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.680> you've

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
mode I'm going to show you if you've

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.340 
mode I'm going to show you if you've
never<00:01:41.009> opened<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:42.000> up<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
never opened one up what you're going to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.190 
never opened one up what you're going to
do<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:43.860> you're<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> set<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> up

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
do and how you're going to set it up

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
do and how you're going to set it up
basically<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.920> motor<00:01:47.430> has<00:01:47.700> three<00:01:48.030> wires

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
basically your motor has three wires

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
basically your motor has three wires
running<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> you're<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.850> match

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
running from it you're going to match

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
running from it you're going to match
those<00:01:51.390> three<00:01:51.659> wires<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.560> wires<00:01:52.920> coming

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
those three wires with the wires coming

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.959 
those three wires with the wires coming
from<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.280> left<00:01:56.790> side

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
from out of the back so on the left side

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
from out of the back so on the left side
you<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.570> red<00:01:57.840> which<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.040> going

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you would have your red which is going

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.880 
you would have your red which is going
to<00:01:59.280> go<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.140> opposite<00:02:01.649> side<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
to go in here on the opposite side you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.399 
to go in here on the opposite side you
have<00:02:02.189> your<00:02:02.430> black<00:02:03.119> which<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> go

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
have your black which is going to go

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.459 
have your black which is going to go

your mount stays fully intact now the
next<00:03:40.290> part<00:03:40.440> we<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.920> our<00:03:41.040> spinner<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.640> our

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
next part we have is our spinner and our

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.620 
next part we have is our spinner and our
collet<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:44.489> reason<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.850> call<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.270> collet

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
collet the reason I call this a collet

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.420 
collet the reason I call this a collet
I'm<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> machinist<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.770> this<00:03:47.070> kind<00:03:47.340> of

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
I'm a machinist so this kind of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.760 
I'm a machinist so this kind of
resembles<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.380> collet<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.650> would

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
resembles a collet that you would

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.060 
resembles a collet that you would
normally<00:03:50.250> find<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> milling<00:03:51.090> machine<00:03:51.120> so

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
normally find on a milling machine so

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.870 
normally find on a milling machine so
basically<00:03:53.070> what<00:03:53.310> you're<00:03:53.430> going<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.670> do<00:03:53.760> is

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
basically what you're going to do is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.300 
basically what you're going to do is
take<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> collet<00:03:54.630> place<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.560> onto<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.100> shaft

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
take the collet place it onto the shaft

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.840 
take the collet place it onto the shaft
of<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.150> motor<00:03:58.160> then<00:03:59.160> you're<00:03:59.400> going<00:03:59.520> to<00:03:59.640> take

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
of the motor then you're going to take

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.240 
of the motor then you're going to take
the<00:04:00.600> spinner<00:04:00.930> part<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.620> sure<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.040> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the spinner part be sure that the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.210 
the spinner part be sure that the
roughing<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.180> facing<00:04:03.690> away<00:04:04.110> from<00:04:04.739> the
