you've<00:00:06.330> probably<00:00:06.600> heard<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.140> protein<00:00:07.529> shakes

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:07.769 
you've probably heard of protein shakes

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.580 
you've probably heard of protein shakes
for<00:00:07.920> hardgainers<00:00:08.460> but<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.120> creatine

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
for hardgainers but what about creatine

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.720 
for hardgainers but what about creatine
well<00:00:10.590> muscle<00:00:11.070> tech<00:00:11.219> has<00:00:11.340> developed<00:00:11.670> a

well muscle tech has developed a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
well muscle tech has developed a
creatine<00:00:11.969> blend<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.450> apparently<00:00:12.959> is<00:00:13.199> meant

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
creatine blend that apparently is meant

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.660 
creatine blend that apparently is meant
for<00:00:13.529> people<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.949> a<00:00:13.980> hard<00:00:14.219> time<00:00:14.279> gaining

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670

for people have a hard time gaining
muscle<00:00:15.209> let's<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> label<00:00:16.710> looks

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
muscle let's see what the label looks

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.130 
muscle let's see what the label looks
like<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> hard

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
like so here we see that this is a hard
