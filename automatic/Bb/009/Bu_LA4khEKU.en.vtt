medical<00:01:08.290> problems<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.880> have<00:01:09.970> been<00:01:10.060> some

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
medical problems there have been some

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.940 
medical problems there have been some
interesting<00:01:10.630> studies<00:01:11.110> one<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.620> them<00:01:11.770> done<00:01:11.920> up

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
interesting studies one of them done up

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.250 
interesting studies one of them done up
at<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.190> University<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.850> Rochester<00:01:13.260> which

at the University of Rochester which

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.680 
at the University of Rochester which
measured<00:01:15.130> people's<00:01:15.580> phthalates<00:01:16.090> levels<00:01:16.540> in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
measured people's phthalates levels in

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.270 
measured people's phthalates levels in
their<00:01:16.840> urine<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.410> there<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.830> direct

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
their urine and there was a direct

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.370 
their urine and there was a direct
correlation<00:01:18.610> between<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.720> higher<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.200> level

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
correlation between the higher the level

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.930 
correlation between the higher the level
the<00:01:20.860> more<00:01:21.460> they<00:01:21.970> weighed<00:01:23.010> why<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.070> this<00:01:24.640> well

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
the more they weighed why is this well

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.010 
the more they weighed why is this well
there's<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.180> couple<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.510> different<00:01:25.810> theories

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
there's a couple of different theories

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.510 
there's a couple of different theories
on<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.560> one<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:27.040> them<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.400> the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
on this one of them is that the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.300 
on this one of them is that the
phthalates<00:01:27.910> have<00:01:28.120> actually<00:01:28.540> an<00:01:28.660> effect<00:01:28.960> on

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
phthalates have actually an effect on

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.890 
phthalates have actually an effect on
locking<00:01:30.310> certain<00:01:31.090> androgens<00:01:31.720> or

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900

testosterone type production and in men

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.000 
testosterone type production and in men
can<00:01:34.570> cause<00:01:34.840> them<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.320> gain<00:01:35.470> weight<00:01:35.680> around<00:01:35.800> the
