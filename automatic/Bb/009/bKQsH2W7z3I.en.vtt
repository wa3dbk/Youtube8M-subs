00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.260
 hello how about people I am the I know and the 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.320
 today I bring you this video because 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.869
 the page is going to be friends or go to 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.369
 france they filtered or I do not know how 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.199
 they got the achievements and trophies of 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.510
 resident evil revelations 2 have also 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.800
 put on your website that is the leave 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.590
 the description of the video so they can see 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.960
 I do not lie and we can play the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.820
 campaign in various ways whether in the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.739
 count down mode consisting of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.110
 end each episode before a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.239
 default time and one mode 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.460
 invisible that surely in this mode 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.320
 the enemies that we face are going to 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.420
 being invisible the game will take us 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.980
 surely at a high level of pressure 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.829
 with these two modes you already know why 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.130
 they will not see the enemies and finish the 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.670
 episode in a predetermined time 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.930
 as if it is more or less difficult what 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.610
 unfortunately there will also be very few 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.989
 trophies in jump mode this time to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.730
 difference from the first installment of 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.980
 revelations let's move on what they would be 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.810
 the trophies and achievements of racing and 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.579
 bull revelations 2 both in xbox and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.229
 playstation the achievements I'm going 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.880
 putting 4 on 4 on the screen 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.590
 that they do not see so very small 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.380
 letters and that they understand more or less better 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 how will it be 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 he achieved the first achievement that was called 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.729
 bounty hunter will consist of collecting a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 total of 50,000 points or points of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.649
 battle that I think this was coming together in 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 the campaign or in assault mode not 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.820
 I remember very well in revelations 1 and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.560
 basically it will consist of collecting 50,000 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.539
 battle points the other did not achieve 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.119
 call your strong to flickr and this one 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.729
 will consist in beating 100 afflicted in 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.380
 the main campaign this because this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.420
 obvious and the first thing that pretty much goes to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 be another one called brain and repair 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 which will consist in winning 100 revenant in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.439
 the main campaign I think affects them 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.349
 for the afflicted are present in the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.649
 declare campaign and resell them in the 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.689
 neighborhood campaign and another one of the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 achievements are called there are final round that 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 will consist in beating enemies like this with the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.360
 knife in the main campaign that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.270
 I suppose it's going to be between barrel and 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.610
 Claire those who have to do 50 and 50 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.509
 or it depends on how murderers they are with 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.269
 everyone 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 another achievement called food for food system 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.680
 will consist of 350 enemies with attacks 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.760
 fixed in the main campaign this therefore 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.370
 it is more than clear 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.230
 another that is called end and stay down is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.209
 to make 50 combos in the campaign 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.799
 main this I guess it's going to be 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.230
 between cleger mobileye between natal district 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.549
 from the shadows defeat 20 enemies with 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.260
 surprise attacks in the campaign 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.989
 main this then then it shows that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.599
 obviously he's going to have to attack 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.060
 stealthily to attack by surprise 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.650
 an e-mail fly slider and dazzle 50 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.069
 enemies with flashlight in mobila 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.920
 main campaign is but good 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.170
 basically when I dazzle 50 enemies 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.409
 as they will go with the lantern and you will gain a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 achievement there is that in dublÃ£n weapons defeat 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.730
 50 of muse with the lever of death in the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.470
 Main campaign bricklayers defeats 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.340
 20 enemies with the natalia ring in 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.349
 the entire campaign 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.819
 natalia another brick I guess it's going to 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.190
 be several bricks that will be able to 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.930
 launch as well as aislinn received four 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.090
 that threw the lamps when you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.030
 I controlled to make the puzzle and then 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.040
 what to get with lyon line in up 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.549
 defeated enemies with a single shot 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 in the main campaign this can be 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.450
 make a shotgun imagine 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.220
 pixar destroys me of 30 shirts with 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.620
 armed arms 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 I imagine that there are rebels with arms 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.840
 armed and revenant with parts of others 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.490
 bodies included is to say that that 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.810
 enemy will vary in the chain in the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.430
 history will see that we meet 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.380
 busted with arms implanted in 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.720
 other parts and you will see is possible 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.700
 reselling with implanted weapons to their 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.590
 bodies that is going to be very varied 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.050
 the enemies there the next achievement is 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.230
 called a cold the skies and this one consists 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.420
 in shooting 30 afflicted in the air in 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.220
 the main campaign there is an aura 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.480
 similar in racing 15 but you have 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.110
 to give him a gesture that cost me 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.420
 too much but in the end I could be 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.070
 notepad steamworks defeat an enemy 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.900
 keeps hitting and chaining a 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.420
 physical attack with claire in the campaign 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.180
 main there is an achievement equal receipt on 5 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.100
 that I more correctly front indicated 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.260
 save your partner from the clutches of 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.419
 enemy 10 times in the campaign because 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.489
 they almost always make similar achievements in 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.450
 We received 5 also announced an achievement 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.980
 similar to that or in 5 in 6 in one 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.600
 of those games there was a similar achievement 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.860
 that he had to save someone from 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.630
 is attacked by the fish and navarra enemy 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.130
 defeat 5 enemies with explosive or 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.430
 a Molotov cocktail in the campaign 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.410
 main this is new this is how you 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.320
 Ford is something like that one meter from the arm 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.140
 and finally the four achievements that are 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.230
 part of the assault mode the first one 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.870
 call drivers of table complete a 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.670
 mission of assault mode obviously this 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.260
 it's the first thing that is going to jamming 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.940
 evaluate an object in assault mode this 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.130
 I do not understand it very much or maybe I 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.490
 we translate in the show icon to want 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.690
 succeed in assault mode and do not like 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.060
 classics defeat them to 20 and the ftc in the 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.190
 main campaign which is a class 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.860
 possibly it is a new enemy that does not 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.169
 we still do not even know what it is but 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.389
 possibly it is a new enemy 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.430
 and then that would be all friends take care 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.800
 Much like if you liked the video 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.680
 share it with friends and comment 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.039
 what do you think these achievements were launched 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.360
 a lot a little bit I do not know and I also wanted 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.129
 give them a notice and possibly 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.599
 the next week I can not go up 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.669
 no news to the channel because 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.520
 finally I will enter the university like this 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.099
 that maybe he does not update them anymore 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.740
 as always I will have to get used to 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.930
 to the new method to new to the new way 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.689

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.590

 try to upload the information every 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.550
