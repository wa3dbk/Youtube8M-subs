easy<00:00:17.120> to<00:00:17.240> measure<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.690> sections<00:00:18.170> and<00:00:18.920> I

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
easy to measure the sections and I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.480 
easy to measure the sections and I
watched<00:00:19.250> one<00:00:19.460> of<00:00:19.490> juniors<00:00:19.880> kick<00:00:20.150> ones<00:00:20.420> videos

through the roofing through this piece
of<00:00:32.599> 2x4<00:00:32.890> which<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.790> scrutinies<00:00:35.329> be<00:00:35.510> long

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
of 2x4 which the scrutinies be long

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.050 
of 2x4 which the scrutinies be long
enough<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:35.990> go<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.380> this<00:00:36.560> 2x4<00:00:36.920> which<00:00:37.760> will<00:00:37.910> give

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.060 
enough to go in this 2x4 which will give

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.860 
enough to go in this 2x4 which will give

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
put three nails in it and this 2x4 is to

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.840 
put three nails in it and this 2x4 is to
help<00:01:02.710> keep<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.890> babies<00:01:04.280> from<00:01:04.430> just<00:01:04.670> running

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
out when I reach in so it just has

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.370 
out when I reach in so it just has
something<00:01:08.180> to<00:01:08.299> protect<00:01:08.570> them<00:01:08.900> from<00:01:09.140> falling

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.420 
it also helps to make this section
sturdier<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.780> doesn't<00:01:15.110> live<00:01:15.229> as<00:01:15.409> much<00:01:18.430> we

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
sturdier so it doesn't live as much we

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.690 
sturdier so it doesn't live as much we
also<00:01:19.700> added<00:01:20.799> this<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:22.100> don't<00:01:22.280> think<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.520> saw
