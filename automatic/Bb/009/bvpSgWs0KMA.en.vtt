normally<00:01:06.230> would<00:01:06.350> light<00:01:06.530> up<00:01:06.560> but<00:01:06.860> because<00:01:07.070> this

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
normally would light up but because this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.270 
normally would light up but because this
is<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.670> prototype<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.930> not<00:01:09.320> doing<00:01:10.040> what<00:01:10.159> it's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
is a prototype it's not doing what it's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.490 
is a prototype it's not doing what it's
meant<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:10.970> i'll<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:12.050> say<00:01:12.170> we<00:01:12.320> have<00:01:12.470> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.030 
meant to do and i'll just say we have a
micro<00:01:12.979> USB<00:01:13.009> port<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.540> because<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.110> supports<00:01:15.680> a

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
micro USB port but because it supports a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.580 
point 5 although this prototype i only
has<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:09.819> 14.4<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:11.140> not<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.470> most

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
has to be 14.4 so it's not the most

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.460 
has to be 14.4 so it's not the most
up-to-date<00:02:11.830> version<00:02:12.190> but<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:14.110> what

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
up-to-date version but you can see what

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.440 
up-to-date version but you can see what
it's<00:02:14.650> meant<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.760> plenty<00:02:16.239> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
it's meant to do it was plenty of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.289 
it's meant to do it was plenty of
customization<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:21.299> again

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
customization going on okay it's again

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.259 
customization going on okay it's again

not<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:26.350> too<00:02:26.380> harsh<00:02:26.739> about<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.130> but<00:02:27.340> anyway

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
not be too harsh about it but anyway

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.229 
not be too harsh about it but anyway
