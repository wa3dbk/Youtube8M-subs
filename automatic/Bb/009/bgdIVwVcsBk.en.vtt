00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.000
 valeri charlotte 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.160
 this time we will hear the point of view 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.080
 of the students when they see that the 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.080
 politicians go to their colleges 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 remember when the boys went to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 visit and they interacted with the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.029
 politicians because that time is everything 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 opposite the politicians went to the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.610
 Let's see what schools say 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.610
 students 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.170
 these are the college students 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.400
 jorge garcÃ­a smiths the boys very 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.150
 spontaneous sharp and something 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.650
 good cool others need something of 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.650
 inspiration in their studies 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.130
 but in the end they all give their best 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 to represent your 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.730
 educational institution 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.450
 today this school was visited by the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.160
 council of the city of bucaramanga 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.340
 there the aediles explained what they are 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 the functions of the corporation and starts 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.680
 they talked about everything they do for the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.230
 education of the beautiful city 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 good that they are those that join with the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 mayor to receive everything that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.170
 we need, I do not like 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.210
 soon you almost never see them almost 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.320
 never come close to asking is more what 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.440
 what they want 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.340
 suddenly but so above and this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.340
 project so good 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.060
 some guys are very clueless with 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.060
 these issues 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.499
 because of the behavior 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.359
 for others to talk about politics is a 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.359
 reason to encourage disorder 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.910
 once 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 for others it is the opportunity to improve 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.880
 the conditions of your institution 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.740
 educational 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 the truth does seem to me that it has served 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.099
 a lot because they have solved many 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.690
 issues that were needed here in the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.970
 society especially here in the north 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.300
 where we live 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.050
 me love me love me by what they hear 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.550
 our opinions 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.750
 and they are the ones who 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.750
 Not every morning 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.409
 for others it is the opportunity to improve 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.079
 the conditions of the institutions 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.120
 educational activities and their participation in 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.580
 Youth policy is active 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.370
 we are in a council meeting for 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.230
 to be able to carry out a project that 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.510
 has the school about a collision in the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.549
 third floor of this institution 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.560
 in this opportunity several councilmen 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.420
 they entered the classrooms to talk 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.420
 directly with the students 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 as an activist in the neck he had a 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.260
 very curious conversation with the students of 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.950
 this school good that what most 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.950
 like your school 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.000
 football and is a good sportsman does not go 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.580
 to be a question 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.200
 since you entered your school in 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.530

 educational institution in the lumbar home 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.420
 he does not tell me that I 'm not going to soccer because 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.430
 like 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.430
 and what youth plays 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.469
 such is for many young people these issues 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.780
 They are very boring but still 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.019
 important to know a little about the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.620
 our mayor's policy and the councils 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.280
 and above all who are the ones who 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.280
 govern 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.080
