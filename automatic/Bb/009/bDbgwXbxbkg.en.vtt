00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
quite a bit sixty-five percent in 24

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.499 
quite a bit sixty-five percent in 24
hours<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> rate<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.320> decline<00:01:49.590> decline

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
hours so at that rate of decline decline

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
hours so at that rate of decline decline
hey<00:01:51.509> who<00:01:51.960> knows<00:01:52.140> maybe<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> have
