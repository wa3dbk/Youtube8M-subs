00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
through a finalized state so that being

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
through a finalized state so that being
said<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:36.119> file<00:01:36.390> itself<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:37.430> pretty<00:01:38.430> smooth<00:01:39.259> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
said the file itself is pretty smooth I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
said the file itself is pretty smooth I
mean<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.220> most<00:01:41.369> part<00:01:41.640> everything<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
mean for the most part everything on it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.290 
mean for the most part everything on it
is<00:01:42.780> still<00:01:43.289> little<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.190> sure<00:01:44.550> somebody<00:01:45.210> will

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
is still little I'm sure somebody will

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.309 
is still little I'm sure somebody will
put<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.660> file<00:01:47.539> relatively<00:01:48.539> soon<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.140> has

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
put out a file relatively soon that has

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.800 
put out a file relatively soon that has
a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:50.610> smoother<00:01:51.090> surfaces<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:53.179> in<00:01:54.179> regards

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
a lot smoother surfaces but in regards

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.639 
a lot smoother surfaces but in regards
to<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.500> file<00:01:55.800> itself<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.550> was<00:01:57.410> not<00:01:58.410> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to the to the file itself it was not the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.930 
to the to the file itself it was not the
best<00:01:58.830> unfold<00:01:59.569> so<00:02:00.569> I<00:02:01.050> mean<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> took<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.190> good

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
best unfold so I mean it took a good

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.449 
best unfold so I mean it took a good
four<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.390> five<00:02:03.660> hours<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.920> cut<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
four or five hours to just cut the

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.990 
four or five hours to just cut the
pieces<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:07.099> get<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.310> glued<00:02:08.819> together

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
pieces out and get them glued together

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.800 
pieces out and get them glued together
and<00:02:09.539> put<00:02:09.990> in<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.819> being<00:02:12.090> said<00:02:12.680> I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and put in so with that being said I

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.020 
and put in so with that being said I
wouldn't<00:02:15.810> suggest<00:02:16.050> using<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.190> quarter<00:02:17.819> file

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
