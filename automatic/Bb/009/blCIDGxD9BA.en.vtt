anyways<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.020> I'm<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.229> really<00:01:13.439> too<00:01:13.619> worried

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
anyways so I'm not really too worried

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
anyways so I'm not really too worried
about<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> flush<00:01:15.360> mounts

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and then fender eliminator kid um yeah

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
and then fender eliminator kid um yeah
that's<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.830> might<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.729> an

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that's probably I might do an

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.700 
that's probably I might do an
aftermarket<00:01:24.360> exhaust<00:01:24.600> has<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> stock<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.380> on

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
aftermarket exhaust has a stock one on

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
aftermarket exhaust has a stock one on
it<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> sounds<00:01:27.869> pretty<00:01:29.180> good<00:01:30.180> for

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it now but it sounds pretty good for

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.130 
it now but it sounds pretty good for
being<00:01:30.540> stock<00:01:31.549> it<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:34.790> almost<00:01:35.990> 27,000<00:01:36.990> miles

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
being stock it has almost 27,000 miles

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.580 
being stock it has almost 27,000 miles
on<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> lot<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.259> let<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> guys

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
on it so a lot here I'll let you guys

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.650 
on it so a lot here I'll let you guys
listen<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:52.200 

stock<00:01:45.660> exhaust

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.910 

I<00:01:53.210> think<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.930> sounds<00:01:54.080> pretty<00:01:54.409> good<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:54.890> being

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
I think it sounds pretty good for being

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.670 
I think it sounds pretty good for being
stock<00:01:55.310> exhaust<00:01:56.020> like<00:01:57.020> most<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.380> ones<00:01:57.470> i've

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
stock exhaust like most the ones i've

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.440 
stock exhaust like most the ones i've
heard<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.009> are<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> lot<00:01:58.369> quieter<00:01:58.580> than<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.119> so

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
heard it are a lot quieter than that so

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.109 
heard it are a lot quieter than that so
i<00:01:59.479> don't<00:01:59.750> know<00:01:59.869> if<00:02:00.640> they<00:02:01.640> took<00:02:01.790> out<00:02:01.940> some

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
i don't know if they took out some

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.260 
i don't know if they took out some
baffles<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.840> something<00:02:03.259> or<00:02:03.560> adam<00:02:03.860> i<00:02:04.270> don't

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
baffles or something or adam i don't

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.249 
baffles or something or adam i don't
know<00:02:05.330> i<00:02:05.479> think<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.750> sounds<00:02:05.930> pretty<00:02:06.050> good

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
know i think it sounds pretty good
