00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.450
 juli sports friends happy start and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 There are a few topics to talk about 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.309
 and the first topic is one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 thing I do not like about it now 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.190
 speak that is very difficult for me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.750
 Frankly, but I think so 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
 to talk to you about it and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.619
 Although you may have noticed the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 last time already that less and less 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.109
 videos also came julia was in it 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.199
 also on facebook and instagram 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.849
 photos and yes it is unfortunately because of that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.520
 separated for our recently 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 i have a very private topic 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 but just thought in this regard that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.110
 she also keeps a big part of the canal 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 was it about it for you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.870
 I have been reporting a lot 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 was open a videos and I think 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.320
 that one point you can address 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 Of course, I want to thank you for that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.969
 do not say anything accurate i think that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.699
 private enough that talk about it here 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 what I want to say is clear if you have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.960
 certainly always seen in the videos 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.359
 very harmonic harmonious and very very 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 happy actually always out and that 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.750
 I actually always had feeling 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.939
 It was me, too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 stop in the country but always say 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 where you are wrong and yes so happens 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 so what, unfortunately, and the puck 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.799
 But I always want to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.689
 Mine would speak out here 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 and I have to do something about Juliet 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.270
 Simply say there are things you can do 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 maybe not as a spectator either 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 Sun will notice and while there are simple 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.540
 things that you sometimes use 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.979
 I simply do not think I think so 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 that it is just here at the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 time to address that last one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.619
 one and a half years look very very big 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 part of the channel was that she was very 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.130
 Much has done behind the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 camera very shelter he the camera 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 she was always the one who kept her 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 Camerawoman has given everything so low 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.250
 as at night partly with mcfit 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.020
 came in and helped me 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.640
 somehow to record the videos 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.579
 Turn and so on she was one to me 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.799
 great help a great prop in the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.119
 In any case very large 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.649
 gratitude on my side 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.540
 Regarding my situation I try 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.590
 Just to see it very rational 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.469
 even if that is natural right now 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 my situation is not that easy 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.700
 because of course I already have one 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.080
 bit but yes 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.489
 I think for all the surfaces 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.660
 stuck in a similar situation 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.800
 I can or guess that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.200
 maybe very good and appreciate 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.370
 Confidence is just so I try 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.959
 it just a bit at the moment 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.660
 such as a roller coaster ride to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.890
 consider life more and there is missing 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.230
 Just show me that very briefly 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.670
 I was not too long ago 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.080
 video just said that I did 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.120
 am happy and arrived and 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.370
 Reflective now that's how I like it 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.660
 good that I estimated that at the time 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 I understand and that I understood 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.099
 am happy because i was i think so 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 Everyone should appreciate when he is at his 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.910
 highlight is that he also knows that it 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.519
 a good one that you appreciate 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.709
 yes, the wrong choice of words was maybe 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.720
 probably the word arrived because 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.950
 Looking back, I think I arrived 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.079
 you probably only when you are 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.209
 maybe dead and you have to 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.860
 probably also in situations where it 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.780
 you are fine and where you get the good 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.849
 situation appreciates that it is 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.750
 relatively fast or not only 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.069
 is relatively fast in any case 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.950
 will go down someday 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.290
 and accordingly, you just have to go with it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 curves two rollercoaster he handle it 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.709
 Of course, you have to appreciate when you go upstairs 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.079
 is and you have to, of course, easy 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.670
 understand and accept if you are 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.200
 sometimes loses control and it 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.590
 There are situations in which you can easily 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.450
 not the control unfortunately and dark city 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.030
 accepted that one is down to everyone 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.260
 case and what is very important is simple 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.540
 that my situation when down there 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.030
 that's just as good for itself 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.470
 Reflect can say now 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.150
 It's about as fast as 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.769
 possible to come up again and in the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.540
 Of course, that's the best case 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.420
 curve surpasses and that of course 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.420
 is higher than the previous or 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.700
 previous curve and according to the motto 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 Well, what does not kill you makes you 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.609
 stronger in any case 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.139
 and that I just mean my thing now 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.150
 of course, I am very concerned right now 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.340
 hard to talk about it but me 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.680
 I think and I speak from experience 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.150
 was often down and in the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.549
 After that I always go higher 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.870
 come as I was before and mine 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.720
 whole energy and power I will now 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.919
 just get stuck professionally and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.139
 Sporty again a little bit higher 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.030
 come and I think everything else is coming 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.099
 then with time and I wanted 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.570
 try to give it away on the way here 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.640
 Let's look at it like that for you 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.170
 in these situations there are 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.210
 just have things in life there 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.200
 no control has no power and it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.840
 There are things you just have to 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.790
 accept and want to be heated 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.400
 we just have to take this time over wine 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.780
 really outlast the best take 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.950
 even if that is difficult at the moment 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.080
 and then I want to be expensive again 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.630
 turn uphill and you have to 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.470
 come back higher and then it will be 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.970
 create in any case the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.860
 come out there you are back up 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.020
 and he is a very important point 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.370
 I wanted to address and yes 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.470
 I just wanted to go here 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.070
 the topic appeal so modest it 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.570
 who knows and is not easy you see 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.460
 is probably my reactions 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.810
 I am also a human emotional it 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.090
 is not easy but i think so 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.720
 I speak so openly and have that 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.490
 I did it now 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.690
 second point is on the weekend 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.030
 i want and 2 and jan simons 2 from 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.800
 Red block in Berlin especially ben band 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.180
 was there too and we have one 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.320
 bit the philipp build and at the same time 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.820
 a little something turned up in the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.670
 Gym a few exercises 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.560
 we ate together and stuff 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.540
 continue and I also wanted to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.000
 point this whole all say 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.000
 So here görke has something against jerky 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.730
 the whole people is not the same 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.800
 celebration does not try my island for 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.930
 Two camps to see only black and white 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.460
 I just say this to my opinion 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.620
 story, I said what I think 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.240
 i think tapes or also mischa 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.180
 certainly another aspect or 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.640
 view and also there would just have to 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.780
 think as I see that the good 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.790
 People I think the band is one 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.930
 great guy just gil and show too 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.420
 really great guys 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.580
 whether dj wear the gym breast 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.180
 wear or whatever I see that there 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.470
 quite relaxed actually and there 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.940
 I wanted to call again 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.090
 i see it for example a band 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.130
 or the berisha listens to these 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.780
 all videos to dislike just like that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.280
 because he stops once or the person 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.420
 once made for a product advertising 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.730
 Maybe what did not matter to you? 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
 yes, the content always looks the same 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.750
 work as hard as me and how 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.810
 everyone else too and respects that 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.730
 acknowledge that and if you have a theme 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.320
 does not fit then says it does but does 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.730
 not read shitstorm amazon 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.380
 because I think the first ones are for 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.060
 all unjustified 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.650
 that's why i think it's very important 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.150
 you simply times even about it I speak 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.260
 like the people just partially 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.330
 Maybe I do not like everyone 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.460
 personally but then i get along well 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.539
 time we get off super well and me 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.400
 and the philipp is also there 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.680
 been as splendid and understand 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.780
 in the end this one suddenly stopped 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.860
 Stock Look That Black White Think 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.349
 it's about salaries 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.550
 now I want to no longer so 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:49.560
 appropriate in any case 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.550
 and yes what else do I want to say 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.969
 actually i think so already 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.590
 enough said in the video perhaps 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.060
 very complete a few things the 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.129
 in things that come to mind especially 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.659
 by the occasion of the synonymous not so 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.939
 positive for me but I was powerful
