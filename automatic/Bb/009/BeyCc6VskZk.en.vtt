more episodes including this one so what
I'm<00:00:19.170> using<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.220> pottery<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.210> this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm using here is a pottery because this

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.160 
I'm using here is a pottery because this
tier<00:00:21.720> t6<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:23.160> about<00:00:23.670> pottery<00:00:24.300> ok<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:24.930> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
tier t6 is all about pottery ok so you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.589 
tier t6 is all about pottery ok so you
need<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.710> create<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.430> turntable<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.420> get

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
need to create a turntable to get

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
need to create a turntable to get
pottery<00:00:28.170> started<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.859> oops<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.429> made<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> mistake

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
pottery started in oops I made a mistake

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.139 
pottery started in oops I made a mistake
there<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.619> stone<00:00:32.579> three

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
there you go you need for stone three

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
there you go you need for stone three
sightings<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.960> redstone<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.649> middle<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sightings one redstone in the middle and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
sightings one redstone in the middle and
one<00:00:35.700> gear<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.450> bottom<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> create<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> turn

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
one gear at the bottom to create a turn

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.119 
one gear at the bottom to create a turn
table<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:39.030> turn<00:00:39.420> tables<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.140> mechanical

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
table now turn tables are mechanical

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.790 
table now turn tables are mechanical
devices<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.120> need<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.570> mechanical<00:00:43.290> power

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
devices so you need a mechanical power

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180 
devices so you need a mechanical power
source<00:00:45.079> supplied<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> best<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
source supplied so the best one is a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
source supplied so the best one is a
water<00:00:47.700> mill<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.450> guys<00:00:48.780> should<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.260> by

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
water mill which guys should all know by

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.389 
water mill which guys should all know by
now<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.239> basically<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.770> power<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.340> needs

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
now and basically and the power it needs

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
now and basically and the power it needs
to<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.879> constructed<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.230> reaches<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to be constructed so it reaches the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.860 
to be constructed so it reaches the
bottom<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> turntable<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> had<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> make

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
bottom of the turntable so I had to make

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
bottom of the turntable so I had to make
a<00:00:57.930> platform<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.289> Erin's<00:01:01.289> fairly

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a platform up like this Erin's fairly

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.759 
a platform up like this Erin's fairly
straightforward<00:01:02.520> how<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> make<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:04.350> guys<00:01:04.500> can

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
straightforward how to make you guys can

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.550 
straightforward how to make you guys can
pause<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> video<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.700> playing<00:01:05.909> along

pause the video if you're playing along

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.550 
pause the video if you're playing along
and<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:09.510> mate<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.200> playing

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and here is one mate I was playing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
and here is one mate I was playing
around<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
around with this and here is the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.660 
around with this and here is the
turntable<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.560> say<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.640> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
turntable now let's say if we get a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.719 
turntable now let's say if we get a
pumpkin<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.630> pumpkin<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> nice<00:01:16.680> example<00:01:16.890> if

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
pumpkin a pumpkin is a nice example if

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.200 
pumpkin a pumpkin is a nice example if
we<00:01:18.509> place<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.960> pumpkin<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.790> turn<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.180> our

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we place a pumpkin here and turn on our

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.190 
we place a pumpkin here and turn on our
turntable<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> put<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> switch<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.610> here

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
turntable I like to put a switch on here

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.429 
turntable I like to put a switch on here
there<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.799> will<00:01:25.950> start<00:01:26.250> turning<00:01:26.880> around

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
there we go it will start turning around

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.609 
there we go it will start turning around
there<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.150> if<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.240> break<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.140> block

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there we go and if we break this block

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.399 
there we go and if we break this block
I'll<00:01:32.100> turn<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.369> creative<00:01:33.180> mode<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.869> I'll<00:01:34.229> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I'll turn on creative mode and I'll get

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.789 
I'll turn on creative mode and I'll get
a<00:01:34.439> lever<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.420> break<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.780> block<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a lever if we break this block and we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.670 
a lever if we break this block and we
place<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.189> lever<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> turntable<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
place a lever on the turntable it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.130 
place a lever on the turntable it
switches<00:01:41.220> directions<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.869> going

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
switches directions so now it is going

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.630 
switches directions so now it is going
clockwise<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> go

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
clockwise and we can make it go

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
clockwise and we can make it go
anti-clockwise<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.710> go<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
anti-clockwise now there we go have a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
anti-clockwise now there we go have a
side<00:01:48.210> angle<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.020> anti-clockwise

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
side angle so it's going anti-clockwise

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.609 
side angle so it's going anti-clockwise
now<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.759> example<00:01:51.270> um<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.409> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
now I like this example um so you can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.100 
now I like this example um so you can
even<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.640> make<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.149> awesome<00:01:54.750> TV

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
even use this to make a awesome TV

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
even use this to make a awesome TV
screen<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.950> animation<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> lot<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
screen or animation I can see a lot of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.499 
screen or animation I can see a lot of
redstone<00:01:57.780> people<00:01:58.290> loving<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.100> feature<00:01:59.509> so

you can have like a countdown clock
going<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.530> place<00:02:04.799> two<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> time<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
going and you can place two at a time so

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.370 
going and you can place two at a time so
we'll<00:02:06.090> place<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.780> rings<00:02:06.930> over<00:02:07.229> there

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
we'll place this one rings over there

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.040 
we'll place this one rings over there
there<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.520> three

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
there we go so we can have three

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.300 
there we go so we can have three
actually<00:02:10.050> no<00:02:10.140> why<00:02:10.319> can't<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.890> three

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
actually no why can't we have three

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.000 
actually no why can't we have three
there<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.810> three

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
there we go now we have three

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.390 
there we go now we have three
so<00:02:14.659> now<00:02:15.659> there's<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.049> one<00:02:16.290> odd<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.799> out<00:02:16.950> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so now there's the one odd one out so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.190 
so now there's the one odd one out so
you<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.909> random<00:02:18.390> pulse<00:02:18.930> or

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you can do like a random pulse or

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
you can do like a random pulse or
whatever<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.680> want<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.280> create<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> game

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
whatever you want and create like a game

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.990 
whatever you want and create like a game
with<00:02:21.780> this<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> main<00:02:23.189> reason<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
with this now the main reason for a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.780 
with this now the main reason for a
turntable<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> create<00:02:25.560> pottery<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.459> if<00:02:26.640> you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
turntable is to create pottery so if you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.720 
turntable is to create pottery so if you
place<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.180> clay<00:02:27.599> block<00:02:27.959> down<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:29.400> creates

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
place a clay block down it creates

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
place a clay block down it creates
different<00:02:30.150> goes<00:02:30.810> through<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> selection<00:02:31.709> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
different goes through a selection of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.399 
different goes through a selection of
several<00:02:32.549> different<00:02:32.940> pottery<00:02:33.329> arm<00:02:33.629> so<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:33.989> goes

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
several different pottery arm so it goes

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.009 
several different pottery arm so it goes
down<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.950> smallest<00:02:35.670> consuming<00:02:36.510> clay

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
down to the smallest consuming clay

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.630 
down to the smallest consuming clay
object<00:02:37.980> which<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.760> earn<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:41.069> think<00:02:41.519> this

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
object which is a earn and I think this

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.729 
object which is a earn and I think this
is<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.060> urn<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.599> then<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.109> breaks<00:02:43.439> off

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
is the urn and then it just breaks off

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.369 
is the urn and then it just breaks off
and<00:02:43.769> gives<00:02:44.069> me<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.510> four<00:02:45.510> blocks<00:02:45.989> so

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
and gives me all the four blocks so

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.360 
and gives me all the four blocks so
first<00:02:47.069> off<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.760> crafts<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.780> going<00:02:49.049> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
first off when it crafts I'm going to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.160 
first off when it crafts I'm going to
turn<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.549> off<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.569> we<00:02:51.720> go<00:02:51.870> hopefully

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
turn it off now there we go hopefully

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
turn it off now there we go hopefully
doesn't<00:02:52.500> change<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.579> i'll<00:02:53.700> change<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.180> back

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
doesn't change and i'll change it back

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.190 
doesn't change and i'll change it back
to<00:02:54.739> normal<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.889> I<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.190> collect<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:57.180> clay<00:02:57.720> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to normal so I can collect the clay and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.930 
to normal so I can collect the clay and
it<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.639> unreal<00:03:00.510> unruhe<00:03:01.109> fired<00:03:01.500> pottery<00:03:02.040> so

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it is a unreal unruhe fired pottery so

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.780 
it is a unreal unruhe fired pottery so
basically<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.629> need<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.109> go<00:03:04.829> on<00:03:04.859> to<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.280> stoked

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
basically you need to go on to a stoked

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.349 
basically you need to go on to a stoked
fire<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.859> basically<00:03:08.489> bake<00:03:09.090> it

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
fire and then you can basically bake it

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.199 
fire and then you can basically bake it
and<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.900> becomes<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.560> kill<00:03:10.980> urn<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.609> just<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.180> a

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
and it becomes a kill urn is just like a

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.460 
and it becomes a kill urn is just like a
small<00:03:12.840> little<00:03:12.870> chest<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:15.239> planter<00:03:15.959> helps

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
small little chest and a planter helps

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.599 
small little chest and a planter helps
you<00:03:16.709> plant<00:03:17.370> your<00:03:17.720> hemp<00:03:18.720> seeds<00:03:19.290> or<00:03:19.560> any<00:03:20.040> week

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
you plant your hemp seeds or any week

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.000 
you plant your hemp seeds or any week
okay<00:03:20.879> so<00:03:20.940> we're<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.449> create<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:22.109> planter

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
okay so we're going to create a planter

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.330 
okay so we're going to create a planter
now<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:24.060> kiln<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.859> next<00:03:26.099> one

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
now this is a kiln and the next one

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.800 
now this is a kiln and the next one
should<00:03:26.519> be<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.699> planter<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.209> well<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.599> need<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
should be a planter and well we need to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.069 
should be a planter and well we need to
stop<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:29.150> hopefully<00:03:30.150> don't<00:03:30.359> you<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.629> you

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
stop it hopefully don't you are you

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.199 
stop it hopefully don't you are you
changed<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.519> that's<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.760> problem<00:03:32.970> with

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
changed so that's the problem with

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.780 
changed so that's the problem with
having<00:03:33.359> multiple<00:03:33.989> gearboxes<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.370> takes<00:03:35.639> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
having multiple gearboxes is it takes a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180 
having multiple gearboxes is it takes a
lot<00:03:35.970> of<00:03:36.000> power<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.569> if<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.440> turn<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
lot of power and if you turn it and the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.280 
lot of power and if you turn it and the
power<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.849> already<00:03:39.299> reached<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.049> will<00:03:40.109> go

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
power is already reached here it will go

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.400 
power is already reached here it will go
here<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.919> change<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.239> basically<00:03:43.230> we

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
here here and change it so basically we

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.089 
here here and change it so basically we
need<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.829> well<00:03:44.819> we<00:03:45.690> need<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.079> change<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.949> again

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
need to well we need to change it again

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:58.930 
need to well we need to change it again
all<00:03:47.549> right<00:03:47.579> I'm<00:03:48.510> sorry<00:03:49.199> all<00:03:49.530> right

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.710 

turn<00:03:59.940> off<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.750> go<00:04:02.120> now<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.180> turn<00:04:03.510> off

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
turn off there we go now we turn off

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.490 
turn off there we go now we turn off
creative<00:04:04.440> mode<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.790> collect<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.540> planter

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
creative mode and we collect the planter

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.130 
creative mode and we collect the planter
now<00:04:07.710> we<00:04:07.770> go<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.070> our<00:04:08.220> stoked<00:04:08.640> fire<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.360> kill<00:04:09.990> me

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
now we go to our stoked fire and kill me

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.800 
now we go to our stoked fire and kill me
and<00:04:10.320> once<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:10.920> have<00:04:11.100> killed<00:04:11.520> on<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.570> the

and once you have killed on in the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.170 
and once you have killed on in the
cauldron<00:04:13.260> with<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.800> hot<00:04:14.010> fire<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:14.880> place

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
cauldron with the hot fire you can place
