a<00:03:29.360> new<00:03:29.900> series<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.350> wheel<00:03:30.500> loader<00:03:30.740> here<00:03:31.010> today

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
a new series of wheel loader here today

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.970 
a new series of wheel loader here today
are<00:03:31.550> each<00:03:31.670> series<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.900> showing<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
are each series so showing the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.040 
are each series so showing the
progression<00:03:34.550> is<00:03:34.700> critical<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.210> us<00:03:35.420> we're

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
progression is critical for us we're

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.740 
progression is critical for us we're
full<00:03:36.650> line<00:03:36.890> manufacturer<00:03:37.460> we've<00:03:38.090> got<00:03:38.300> 14

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
full line manufacturer we've got 14

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.500 
full line manufacturer we've got 14
different<00:03:38.990> product<00:03:39.950> lines<00:03:40.270> so<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.360> takes

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
different product lines so it takes

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.300 
different product lines so it takes
quite<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.810> lot<00:03:41.960> of<00:03:41.990> coordination<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:43.010> get<00:03:43.160> the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
quite a lot of coordination to get the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.830 
quite a lot of coordination to get the
different<00:03:43.730> aspects<00:03:44.180> of<00:03:44.330> research<00:03:44.720> and

different aspects of research and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.480 
different aspects of research and
development<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.440> come<00:03:45.590> together<00:03:45.770> one<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.400> our

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
development to come together one of our

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.640 
development to come together one of our
biggest<00:03:46.670> challenges<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.420> teaching<00:03:48.170> engineers

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
biggest challenges is teaching engineers

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.440 
biggest challenges is teaching engineers
how<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:49.250> how<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.460> problem-solve<00:03:50.180> and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
how to think how to problem-solve and

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.680 
how to think how to problem-solve and
how<00:03:51.110> to<00:03:51.170> advance<00:03:51.620> themselves<00:03:52.450> many<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
how to advance themselves many of the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.650 
how to advance themselves many of the
markets<00:03:54.110> are<00:03:54.320> very<00:03:54.650> advanced<00:03:55.160> dimensions<00:03:55.660> but

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
markets are very advanced dimensions but

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.140 
markets are very advanced dimensions but
many<00:03:57.050> are<00:03:57.230> not<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.950> we<00:03:58.190> need<00:03:58.340> simple<00:03:58.730> machines

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
many are not so we need simple machines

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.110 
many are not so we need simple machines
that<00:03:59.870> can<00:04:00.050> go<00:04:00.290> into<00:04:00.500> markets<00:04:01.190> where<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.730> fuel

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that can go into markets where the fuel

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.240 
that can go into markets where the fuel
is<00:04:02.150> not<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:02.900> clean<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.200> we<00:04:03.740> need<00:04:03.920> some<00:04:04.130> pretty

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
is not so clean and we need some pretty
