00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this to play at the same here then put

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
this to play at the same here then put
this<00:01:41.640> edge<00:01:42.500> no<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> Vulcans<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.420> probably<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this edge no the Vulcans are probably is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.649 
this edge no the Vulcans are probably is
a<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.960> easier<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.420> know

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
a much easier way to do this I do know

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.620 
a much easier way to do this I do know
the<00:01:48.750> redstone<00:01:49.259> make<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> much<00:01:50.460> smaller<00:01:51.259> but

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the redstone make it much smaller but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.410 
the redstone make it much smaller but
I'm<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> best<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.140> redstone<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
I'm not the best for redstone so this is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.850 
I'm not the best for redstone so this is
probably<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> easiest<00:01:57.960> way<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.650> make

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
probably one of the easiest way to make

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.460 
probably one of the easiest way to make
