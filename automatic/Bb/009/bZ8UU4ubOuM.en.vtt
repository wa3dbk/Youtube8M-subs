00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.459 
really easy to use all you do is you
pour<00:00:55.640> your<00:00:56.030> desired<00:00:56.960> amount<00:00:57.079> into<00:00:57.379> a

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
disposable cup and add hot water it

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.880 
disposable cup and add hot water it
doesn't<00:01:02.360> take<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.539> lot<00:01:02.809> of<00:01:02.870> gelatin<00:01:03.410> to<00:01:03.440> get<00:01:03.680> a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
doesn't take a lot of gelatin to get a

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.309 
doesn't take a lot of gelatin to get a
cool<00:01:04.219> effect<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.269> small<00:01:05.630> packet<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.139> this

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:06.319 
cool effect so a small packet like this

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.050 
cool effect so a small packet like this
could<00:01:06.590> cover<00:01:07.369> almost<00:01:07.670> your<00:01:07.969> entire<00:01:07.999> face<00:01:08.689> I

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
could cover almost your entire face I

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.249 
could cover almost your entire face I
probably<00:01:11.060> won't<00:01:11.329> even<00:01:11.479> use<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.840> much<00:01:12.700> well

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
probably won't even use that much well

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:23.130 
probably won't even use that much well
let's<00:01:15.259> see<00:01:15.409> how<00:01:15.529> this<00:01:15.649> goes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
little bit doesn't take much and mix it

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.920 
little bit doesn't take much and mix it
around<00:02:23.190> until<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.480> gets<00:02:24.810> really<00:02:25.140> gooey<00:02:28.100> nasty

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.650 

don't<00:02:33.379> know<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.799> see<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.099> but

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.660 

it<00:02:38.230> will<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:38.740> liquidy<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> while

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
it will be a little liquidy for a while

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.940 
it will be a little liquidy for a while
especially<00:02:39.850> you<00:02:40.240> put<00:02:40.450> too<00:02:40.570> much<00:02:40.690> water<00:02:40.960> but

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
especially you put too much water but

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.040 
especially you put too much water but
once<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.910> cools<00:02:43.150> down<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:43.900> bit<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.870> can

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
once it cools down a little bit you can

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.340 
once it cools down a little bit you can
slather<00:02:47.710> it<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.400> face<00:02:48.610> also<00:02:49.450> another

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
slather it on the face also another

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.410 
slather it on the face also another
reason<00:02:50.500> make<00:02:50.860> sure<00:02:51.010> cool<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.030> don't<00:02:52.150> burn

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
reason make sure cool so you don't burn

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.770 
reason make sure cool so you don't burn
them<00:02:52.660> once<00:02:52.960> again

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.199 

still<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> little<00:02:57.650> wet<00:02:57.950> still<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.550> little<00:02:58.760> wet

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.020 

okay<00:03:03.209> let's<00:03:03.480> try<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.830> turn<00:03:04.830> your<00:03:04.950> head<00:03:05.030> to

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
okay let's try this turn your head to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.020 
okay let's try this turn your head to
toe<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.200> way<00:03:07.349> make<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.890> clips<00:03:08.160> facing<00:03:08.880> up

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
toe it that way make it clips facing up

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.910

through<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:18.660> could<00:05:18.840> what<00:05:19.410> I'm<00:05:19.560> going<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.770> do

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
through you could what I'm going to do

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.410 
through you could what I'm going to do
is<00:05:20.160> set<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.090> up<00:05:21.270> with<00:05:21.390> some<00:05:21.570> powder<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:22.170> then

is set it up with some powder and then

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.250 
is set it up with some powder and then
plus<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.600> colors<00:05:24.930> on<00:05:25.050> top<00:05:26.330> if<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.570> don't<00:05:28.020> mind

plus the colors on top if you don't mind

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260 
plus the colors on top if you don't mind
using<00:05:28.470> liquid<00:05:28.770> latex<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.490> can<00:05:29.640> also<00:05:29.790> put

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
using liquid latex you can also put

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.200 
using liquid latex you can also put
lasix<00:05:30.690> on<00:05:30.810> top<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:31.850> use<00:05:32.850> it<00:05:32.880> as<00:05:33.150> a

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
lasix on top of it and use it as a

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.300 
lasix on top of it and use it as a
sealant<00:05:33.630> because<00:05:34.080> this<00:05:34.470> stuff<00:05:34.680> is<00:05:34.920> really

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
sealant because this stuff is really

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.850 
sealant because this stuff is really
soft<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.790> gooey<00:05:35.970> now<00:05:36.240> but<00:05:36.540> after<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.440> while<00:05:37.620> it

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
soft and gooey now but after a while it

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.540 
soft and gooey now but after a while it
will<00:05:37.950> get<00:05:38.100> really<00:05:38.940> hard<00:05:39.300> rigid<00:05:39.750> on<00:05:40.050> your<00:05:40.200> face

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
will get really hard rigid on your face

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.190 
will get really hard rigid on your face
so<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.730> liquid<00:05:42.000> latex<00:05:42.210> helps<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:42.870> keep<00:05:43.020> it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
so the liquid latex helps to keep it

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.400 
so the liquid latex helps to keep it
soft<00:05:43.970> while<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.150> on<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.540> so<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:45.990> still

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
soft while it's on you so it still

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.630 
soft while it's on you so it still
remains<00:05:46.710> such<00:05:46.950> bull<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.400> can<00:05:47.520> move

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
remains such bull and you can move

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.180 
remains such bull and you can move
around<00:05:47.820> well<00:05:48.690> I'm<00:05:49.200> going<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.470> get<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.710> coloring

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
around well I'm going to get to coloring

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.310 
around well I'm going to get to coloring
and<00:05:51.090> I'll<00:05:51.240> get<00:05:51.420> that<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:51.750> it's<00:05:51.930> all<00:05:52.020> done<00:05:52.200> all

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.440 
and I'll get that you it's all done all
right
