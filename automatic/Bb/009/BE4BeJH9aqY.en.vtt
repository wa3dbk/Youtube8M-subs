00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
a 180 turn so to do that it looks like

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.250 
a 180 turn so to do that it looks like
this<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> pretty<00:00:30.420> simple<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
this so this is pretty simple all you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
this so this is pretty simple all you
have<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.650> take<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.160> right<00:00:32.520> foot<00:00:33.120> and

have to do is take your right foot and
then<00:00:34.140> lift<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> heel<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
then lift the heel up so you're kind of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.270 
then lift the heel up so you're kind of
on<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> toe<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.140> left<00:00:37.500> foot<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
on the toe then my left foot is going to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.060 
on the toe then my left foot is going to
slide<00:00:38.730> underneath<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.809> area<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.950> that's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
slide underneath that area and that's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
slide underneath that area and that's
what<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> twist<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
what I'm going to kind of twist to the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:42.950 
what I'm going to kind of twist to the
right

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
right

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
right
now<00:00:43.829> both<00:00:44.160> my<00:00:44.460> toes<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:45.329> pointing<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.829> this

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
now both my toes are pointing in this

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
now both my toes are pointing in this
direction<00:00:47.039> they're<00:00:47.640> exactly<00:00:48.120> facing<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
direction they're exactly facing the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
direction they're exactly facing the
same<00:00:48.750> way<00:00:48.809> parallel<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.770> each<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.280> then

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
same way parallel to each other and then

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
same way parallel to each other and then
this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> where<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.899> twist<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this is where I'm going to twist to the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.209 
this is where I'm going to twist to the
left<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> make<00:00:55.379> me<00:00:55.829> able<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
left and that's going to make me able to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.569 
left and that's going to make me able to
twist<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> way<00:00:57.090> around<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.440> 180<00:00:59.010> again

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
twist all the way around in a 180 again

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
twist all the way around in a 180 again
from<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> back<00:01:00.840> side<00:01:03.409> now<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.650> you've<00:01:04.739> got

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
from the back side now that you've got

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
from the back side now that you've got
that<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.519> number<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> be

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that one down number two is going to be

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.679 
that one down number two is going to be
a<00:01:07.170> nice<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> hop<00:01:08.310> move<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.479> some

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
a nice kind of hop move and then some

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.510 
a nice kind of hop move and then some
really<00:01:10.020> cool<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> foot<00:01:10.890> switches<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.400> get

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really cool kind of foot switches to get

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.899 
really cool kind of foot switches to get
us<00:01:11.610> back<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> Center<00:01:12.270> looks<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:13.020> this

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.270 

so<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.409> simple<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so this one is really simple if you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.350 
so this one is really simple if you
break<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.939> you're<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> be

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
break it down all you're going to be

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
break it down all you're going to be
doing<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.719> hopping<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.500> feet<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.950> wider

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
doing is hopping your feet out wider

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
doing is hopping your feet out wider
than<00:01:26.909> your<00:01:27.030> shoulders<00:01:27.600> you'll<00:01:28.289> bend<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
than your shoulders you'll bend in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
than your shoulders you'll bend in
naturally<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.930> doing<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
naturally and then all I'm doing really

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
naturally and then all I'm doing really
fast<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.039> that<00:01:32.220> moving<00:01:32.729> my<00:01:32.880> toes<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.479> heels

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
fast is that moving my toes my heels

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130 
fast is that moving my toes my heels
separately<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.820> three<00:01:36.179> and<00:01:36.810> then

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
separately to go one two three and then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.719 
separately to go one two three and then
back<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> beginning<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.429> a<00:01:38.460> little

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
back to the beginning take you a little

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.300 
back to the beginning take you a little
more<00:01:38.909> or<00:01:39.570> less<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:40.799> than<00:01:40.890> three<00:01:41.069> or<00:01:41.159> four

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
more or less more than three or four

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.700 
more or less more than three or four
steps<00:01:41.549> depends<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.479> how<00:01:42.659> wide<00:01:42.929> you<00:01:43.170> jump<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
steps depends on how wide you jump and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
steps depends on how wide you jump and
then<00:01:44.009> how<00:01:44.159> fast<00:01:44.490> you're<00:01:44.670> bringing<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
then how fast you're bringing in so

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.740 
then how fast you're bringing in so
really<00:01:46.110> slowly<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:47.009> hop<00:01:47.369> there's<00:01:48.360> some

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
really slowly got your hop there's some

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.950 
really slowly got your hop there's some
N<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> mini<00:01:50.189> squat<00:01:50.549> position<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.360> then

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
N like a mini squat position and then

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.910 
N like a mini squat position and then

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
we're going to yo toe heel toe pop the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.039 
we're going to yo toe heel toe pop the
third<00:01:59.280> content<00:01:59.819> gets<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.240> guys<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.929> some
