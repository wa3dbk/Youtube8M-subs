00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.839
 this meat is from the Paraguayan Chaco these 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.200
 trees are from the Paraguayan Chaco when 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:12.310
 this Saturday comes to its cooking point 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.320
 55 hectares of trees will be cut down 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.660
 Here, Paraguay places me in sixth place 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.120
 export in the world the felling of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.890
 forests first with the greatest 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.890
 rate of deforestation of the planet 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.470
 i 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.300
 the view goes and belongs to the community 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.460
 curtain and this religious group that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.570
 colonized the central chaco in the 20s 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.140
 the afforestation issue this is 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.710
 very exaggerated what we are reading 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 every day in the media is true 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 it's a fast pace 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.150
 This is famous for certification and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.940
 climate change 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.560
 for me it's all a farce the boom 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 rancher that increased to five million 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 six hundred thousand bovine Chaco and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.370
 It is to continue adding further 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.710
 seeks to develop the mass cultivation of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.720
 transgenic in this region 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
 these reasons that in the last four 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.659
 years, forests are equivalent 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.180
 to 90 cities of assumption there is a phrase 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.790
 that says the chaco is the future of the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.270
 wta livestock 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.630
 so 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.509
 and livestock production is not possible 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.570
 without deforestation to that just then 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.460
 we are leaving a great flood surprised 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.310
 this year the Chaco and other parts of the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.979
 country before they said droughts very 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.569
 prolonged one of the first 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.070
 consequences for example of a 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.390
 deforestation situation 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.569
 very important and advance what was done 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.750
 in the Chaco is the issue that 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.020
 previously people said it was raining 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.890
 a lot but he did not feel much 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.450
 today there is much more this deer 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.970
 ostrich and this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.850
 chan his wild 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.300
 that in my childhood where was all the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.780
 world because because every year there 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.050
 water through the rooms I do not know if 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.270
 here you can perceive I think that 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.880
 surely you can perceive a lot 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.520
 better in a region where it says weather was 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.500
 more regular as in the eastern region 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.560
 or here 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.440
 for example if I was going to ask the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.630
 people like that if he if this is the change 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.380
 climatic all the iguanas also that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.380
 come then 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.220
 good the short-term effects we have 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.319
 some of the typical effects are the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.680
 periods of drought there are regions with 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.870
 usual dry periods ok 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.700
 as long as all the flora is usual 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.830
 fauna and human systems are 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 adapted here in Paraguay we know the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.579
 rainy season begins September 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.560
 ends more or less in March we are 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.390
 prepared that the prat the Paraguay river and 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.150
 as there all the others are flooded 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.640
 to some extent at that time a 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.150
 flood of the paraguay river in July that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.250
 We from June to July, August are 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.599
 the months of female drought that the 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 Flooding of the Paraguay River is true 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.750
 occurs always in the season of 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.060
 rainy summer a flood in 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.400
 winter is atypical the laws 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.040
 environmental issues in Paraguay require 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.930
 minimum conservation of 25% of the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.989
 forests in agricultural undertakings 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.420
 in the western region in order to 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.700
 secure reservations things however 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.780
 who is responsible for controlling this in the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.390
 chaco 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.780
 and currently the public ministry 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.050
 has two attending officials 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.050
 fiscal 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.840
 Van 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.989
 and a fiscal agent specialized in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.699
 issues of media rights crimes 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.949
 against the environment and against the 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.850
 drug trafficking either do not have a 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.850
 anchovy office 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.099
 the public ministry good you 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.099
 you can see here our infrastructure 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.590
 the national forestry institute must 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.479
 attend all interventions 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.479
 prosecutors on environmental crimes 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.450
 why 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.560
 generally the products go with 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:07.090
 documented pieces and usually the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.090
 policemen do more controls 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.810
 I believe that the last years and the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.360
 last 10 years people are fulfilling 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.450
 the laws because because nowadays with 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.550
 the technology is here from your office or 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.860
 you can know if the rancher is casting 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.460
 the mount amazon or not internet then 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.689
 I think that this is being 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.209
 doing within the laws 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.389
 and good, having an average of 10 

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:42.139
 monthly complaints of non-compliance 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.209
 we can say that there are many many 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.599
 crimes against the environment we can 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.819
 say that the range of people that 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.149
 commit crimes against the environment 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.659
 affect all people and whatever 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:55.659
 be its origin 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:08.010
 that possibility must be weighed a little 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.650
 to be the most famous from the Chaco in 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.570
 livestock production or also say 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.580
 well here is a commitment there 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.790
 keep this commitment with it 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.190
 humanity you have to stop this and 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.520
 keep the rest but that too or 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.520
 it does not only depend on the 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.520
 producers 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:31.029
 the environmentalists estimated that at 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.009
 pace of current deforestation at 25 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.940
 years the Chaco will reach its limit of 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.770
 Reservations 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.880
 land 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:46.010
 he only has 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.800
 for the wounds just 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.920
 Tender 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.350
 just land 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.350
 for thought
