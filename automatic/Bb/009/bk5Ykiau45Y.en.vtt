00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
but I'm just not a big fan of this but I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
but I'm just not a big fan of this but I
know<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.409> people<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.850> right

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
know some people do like that all right

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.640 
know some people do like that all right
here<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> camera<00:01:36.869> cut<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.470> see

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here is the camera cut out you can see

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.109 
here is the camera cut out you can see
if<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> cut<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> camera<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
if a cut off for the camera and also the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
if a cut off for the camera and also the
LED<00:01:39.509> flash<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.079> did<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.829> white<00:01:41.159> out

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
LED flash I did get a little white out

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
LED flash I did get a little white out
on<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> might<00:01:42.420> use<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> flash<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
on this so you might use the flash is

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
on this so you might use the flash is
kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> washed<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
kind of washed out a little bit but this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.760 
kind of washed out a little bit but this
is<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> white<00:01:45.630> case<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.170> probably<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.649> I'd

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
is a white case so probably what I'd

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
is a white case so probably what I'd
suggest<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.579> using<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> sharpie<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
suggest here is using that sharpie and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170 
suggest here is using that sharpie and
maybe<00:01:49.170> color<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.460> outline<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.000> of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
maybe color in the the outline here of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910 
maybe color in the the outline here of
the<00:01:51.630> case<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.079> seems<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> help<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.740> most

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the case that seems to help on most

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
the case that seems to help on most
cases<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.060> I'd<00:01:54.149> suggest<00:01:54.540> on

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
cases so that's what I'd suggest on

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.999 
cases so that's what I'd suggest on
these<00:01:54.810> lighter<00:01:55.049> color<00:01:55.439> cases<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
these lighter color cases and that

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
these lighter color cases and that
should<00:01:56.280> help<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:56.670> any<00:01:56.850> washing<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
should help with any washing out of the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.690 
should help with any washing out of the
colors<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.380> flash<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
colors with the flash and then for the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.950 
colors with the flash and then for the
face<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.210> phone<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.540> obviously<00:02:00.899> not

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
face of the phone it's obviously not

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
face of the phone it's obviously not
going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.500> bubble<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.860> any<00:02:02.070> screen<00:02:02.310> protector

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
going to bubble up any screen protector

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370 
going to bubble up any screen protector
or<00:02:02.759> anything<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.509> comes<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
or anything because it comes up right to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
or anything because it comes up right to
the<00:02:04.409> edge<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> glass<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the edge of the glass not much of a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.580 
the edge of the glass not much of a
raised<00:02:06.509> edge<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.380> put<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
raised edge on this so when you put it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.229 
raised edge on this so when you put it
down<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> table<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:08.970> moves<00:02:09.149> around

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
down on the table and if it moves around

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.820 
down on the table and if it moves around
the<00:02:09.539> glass<00:02:09.720> will<00:02:10.020> be<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.349> against<00:02:10.679> whatever

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the glass will be up against whatever

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.100 
the glass will be up against whatever
surface<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.550> potential<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:12.330> some<00:02:12.599> scratches

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
surface so potential for some scratches

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
surface so potential for some scratches
on<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
on that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
on that
on<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.100> overall<00:02:14.340> fit<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.760> finish<00:02:14.910> here<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
on the overall fit and finish here this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
on the overall fit and finish here this
is<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> glossy<00:02:16.110> plastic<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.400> a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
is a glossy plastic so it can be a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890 
is a glossy plastic so it can be a
little<00:02:17.610> slick<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:18.090> believe<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.570> models

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
little slick I believe the other models

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.180 
little slick I believe the other models
have<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.260> more<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> matte<00:02:19.740> finish<00:02:19.770> but

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
have a little more of a matte finish but

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.800 
have a little more of a matte finish but
this<00:02:20.310> white<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:20.640> particular<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> glossy

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
this white one particular is a glossy

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.810 
this white one particular is a glossy
white<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.650> you'll<00:02:22.830> sweat<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.370> hands

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
white so if you'll sweat on your hands

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.250 
white so if you'll sweat on your hands
or<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.940> little<00:02:24.270> oil<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.840> could<00:02:24.990> become<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
or a little oil you know could become a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
or a little oil you know could become a
little<00:02:25.500> slick<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:25.980> no<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.460> than<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
little slick but no more so than the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
little slick but no more so than the
iphone<00:02:27.630> 4<00:02:27.840> without<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> case<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.860> also<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.580> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
iphone 4 without a case and also this is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.640 
iphone 4 without a case and also this is
a<00:02:29.760> lightweight<00:02:30.090> case<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.260> depends

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a lightweight case so you know depends

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
a lightweight case so you know depends
what<00:02:31.770> you're<00:02:31.920> looking<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.580> case<00:02:32.760> some

people are looking for a case without a

people are looking for a case without a
whole<00:02:34.530> lot<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.770> bulk<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.160> would<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> good

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
whole lot of bulk this would be a good

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.340 
whole lot of bulk this would be a good
candidate<00:02:35.940> for<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.720> other<00:02:36.870> people<00:02:37.200> are
