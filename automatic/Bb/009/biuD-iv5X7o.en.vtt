00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
the cafe explosion sequence was actually

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
the cafe explosion sequence was actually
challenging<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.699> two<00:00:29.880> aspects<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.689> aspect

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
challenging on two aspects one aspect

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
challenging on two aspects one aspect
was<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> Chris<00:00:32.099> wanted<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.180> whole

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
was that Chris wanted this whole

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
was that Chris wanted this whole
explosion<00:00:33.710> sequence<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> take<00:00:34.980> place<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
explosion sequence to take place in the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.209 
explosion sequence to take place in the
middle<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.820> Paris<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:37.380> prisons<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.190> not

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
middle of Paris and the prisons are not

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.639 
middle of Paris and the prisons are not
too<00:00:38.610> friendly<00:00:39.270> towards<00:00:39.840> explosions<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
too friendly towards explosions in the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.580 
too friendly towards explosions in the
middle<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.950> Paris<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.660> started

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
middle of Paris so when we started

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.020 
middle of Paris so when we started
talking<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.850> were<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
talking to them about what we were going
to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> faces<00:00:45.960> were<00:00:46.350> pretty<00:00:46.590> grim<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to do the faces were pretty grim so that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.400 
to do the faces were pretty grim so that
was<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> first<00:00:48.300> issue<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> second<00:00:49.320> issue

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
was the first issue and the second issue

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
was the first issue and the second issue
is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> Chris<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.370> wanted<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> get

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is that Chris really wanted to get

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.770 
is that Chris really wanted to get
Leonardo<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> Ellen<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.980> shop<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
Leonardo and Ellen in the shop the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.389 
Leonardo and Ellen in the shop the
school<00:00:55.050> board<00:00:55.230> came<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
school board came up with this way of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
school board came up with this way of
creating<00:00:57.390> an<00:00:57.510> explosion<00:00:57.899> using<00:00:58.320> air<00:00:58.469> cannons

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
creating an explosion using air cannons

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.160 
creating an explosion using air cannons
and<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.699> did<00:00:59.879> tests<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.390> people<00:01:00.809> sitting<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and we did tests with people sitting in

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
and we did tests with people sitting in
front<00:01:01.230> action<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.309> showed<00:01:02.550> them<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.239> Leo

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
front action and we showed them to Leo

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
front action and we showed them to Leo
and<00:01:03.539> showed<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> Ellen<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.589> said<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and showed it to Ellen and said this is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
and showed it to Ellen and said this is
what<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.500> also

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
what it's going to be you know and also

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.860 
what it's going to be you know and also
we<00:01:07.950> had<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> car<00:01:08.400> flipping<00:01:09.150> over<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> for

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.240 
motorbike flipping over in front of him
they're<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.900> away<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.770> added<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
they're all going away and all added to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.300 
they're all going away and all added to
the<00:01:14.400> overall<00:01:15.030> effect<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> we've<00:01:16.800> tested

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the overall effect of it we've tested

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.430 
the overall effect of it we've tested
and<00:01:17.610> tested<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:18.090> tested<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.540> whole<00:01:18.750> shot<00:01:19.200> I

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
and tested and tested that whole shot I

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.800 
and tested and tested that whole shot I
mean<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.680> sat<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.490> replica<00:01:21.090> explosion<00:01:21.660> at

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
mean I sat in a replica explosion at

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
mean I sat in a replica explosion at
least<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.320> times<00:01:22.550> just<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:23.730> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
least three or four times just so you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.890 
least three or four times just so you
know<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> could<00:01:24.330> give<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:24.510> first-hand

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
know I could give a first-hand

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.980 
know I could give a first-hand
experience<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.190> know<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.730> like

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
experience of you know what it was like

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.300 
experience of you know what it was like
it<00:01:27.990> must<00:01:28.230> have<00:01:28.350> been<00:01:28.440> when<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.680> did<00:01:28.830> shoot<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it must have been when we did shoot it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
it must have been when we did shoot it
it<00:01:29.550> seemed<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.120> lot<00:01:30.330> different<00:01:30.750> having<00:01:30.990> Leonel

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
it seemed a lot different having Leonel

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
it seemed a lot different having Leonel
and<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.040> amongst<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.550> hold<00:01:32.730> explosion<00:01:33.420> they

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and in amongst our hold explosion they

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.120 
and in amongst our hold explosion they
were<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> their<00:01:33.870> own<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.320> safety<00:01:34.620> area

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
were in their own little safety area

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
were in their own little safety area
where<00:01:35.340> even<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.940> paper<00:01:36.150> cut<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> table

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
where even the paper cut on the table

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.730 
where even the paper cut on the table
didn't<00:01:37.290> move

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
didn't move

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.880 
didn't move
I<00:01:38.780> always<00:01:39.780> knew<00:01:40.020> there'd<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.230> a<00:01:40.320> massive

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
I always knew there'd be a massive

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.620 
I always knew there'd be a massive

effects components the seams but it was

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.460 
effects components the seams but it was
very<00:01:44.910> important<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.300> me<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.510> we<00:01:45.600> shot<00:01:45.930> as

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
very important to me that we shot as

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.740 
very important to me that we shot as
much<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.130> possible<00:01:47.190> in<00:01:47.610> camera<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
much of it as possible in camera to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870 
much of it as possible in camera to
really<00:01:49.140> give<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.590> visual<00:01:49.860> effects<00:01:50.160> guys<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
really give the visual effects guys the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.490 
really give the visual effects guys the
chance<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.870> do<00:01:52.020> best<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.380> is

visual<00:02:02.760> effects<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.480> can<00:02:03.690> add<00:02:03.960> more

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
visual effects is we can add more

visual effects is we can add more
destruction<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.880> add<00:02:05.970> more<00:02:06.270> debris<00:02:06.600> in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
destruction we can add more debris in
particular<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.250> add<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:09.690> stuff

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
particular we can add the kind of stuff

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.690 
particular we can add the kind of stuff
that's<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.080> wasn't<00:02:10.500> possible<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.130> on<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that's just wasn't possible to do on the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
that's just wasn't possible to do on the
day<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.210> actually<00:02:12.330> filmed<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.930> which<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
day when you actually filmed it which is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.550 
day when you actually filmed it which is
all<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.470> hard<00:02:13.770> rigid<00:02:14.760> bits<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.660> masonry<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
all the hard rigid bits of masonry and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280 
all the hard rigid bits of masonry and
glass<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.130> furniture<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.540> pottery<00:02:19.110> and

glass and furniture and pottery and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.810 
glass and furniture and pottery and
things<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.980> what<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
things like that so what you see is a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
things like that so what you see is a
combination<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.420> reality<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.590> this

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
combination of reality and then this

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
combination of reality and then this
extra<00:02:23.280> level<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.880> bring<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.300> this

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
extra level that we can bring to it this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.080 
extra level that we can bring to it this
extra<00:02:24.750> level<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.020> danger<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.500> destruction

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
extra level of danger and destruction

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.699 
extra level of danger and destruction
Chris<00:02:27.090> sort<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.810> came<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.410> notion

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
Chris sort of came up with this notion

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.640 
Chris sort of came up with this notion
of<00:02:29.100> being<00:02:29.940> underwater<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:31.050> we're<00:02:31.470> watching

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
of being underwater where we're watching

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.130 
of being underwater where we're watching
visual<00:02:32.370> explosions<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.510> been<00:02:33.690> shot<00:02:34.020> at

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
visual explosions that have been shot at

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.640 
visual explosions that have been shot at
many<00:02:34.380> different<00:02:34.470> speeds<00:02:35.100> there's<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.300> of

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
many different speeds there's a lot of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.320 
many different speeds there's a lot of
precise<00:02:37.650> mathematical<00:02:37.980> thought<00:02:38.580> design<00:02:39.090> that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
precise mathematical thought design that

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.260 
precise mathematical thought design that
went<00:02:39.510> into<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.870> from<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> guys<00:02:40.530> at<00:02:40.680> double-

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
went into it from the guys at double-

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.550 
went into it from the guys at double-
particular<00:02:42.270> with<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.450> idea<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.140> almost

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
particular with the idea of the almost

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.770 
particular with the idea of the almost
fractal<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.340> nature<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.790> its<00:02:44.970> destruction

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
fractal like nature of its destruction

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380 
fractal like nature of its destruction
so<00:02:46.650> when<00:02:46.830> there's<00:02:47.040> an<00:02:47.130> explosion<00:02:47.550> things

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
so when there's an explosion things

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.090 
so when there's an explosion things
fragmented<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.989> smaller<00:02:49.260> pieces<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.980> look

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
fragmented to smaller pieces if you look

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.500 
fragmented to smaller pieces if you look
at<00:02:50.160> those<00:02:50.310> smaller<00:02:50.610> pieces<00:02:50.820> they're<00:02:51.150> in<00:02:51.270> turn

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
at those smaller pieces they're in turn

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.090 
at those smaller pieces they're in turn
fragmenting<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.620> thought<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:52.950> was<00:02:53.070> a

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
fragmenting and I thought this was a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.180 
fragmenting and I thought this was a
nice<00:02:53.340> way<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.790> really<00:02:54.570> tying<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.320> with<00:02:55.590> the

nice way of really tying in with the
