 first of all, welcome to kester 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.750
 With nightstand coming in the entire village case the facial skin was at the expense of it 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.009
 France 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.009
 I am a warrior playing field in the Greek crisis of the campsite 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.710
 the purpose of this campsite is to provide as much information as possible about it 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.919
 child in the area in a few minutes 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.380
 after the animal is finished you will also find someone with twenty places 

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.379
 Dierckx to answer any questions 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.890
 you can get the paper version year on the restriction with all possible channels 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.950
 the campsite is that is 150 meters high 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.000
 we played well but on stage 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.330
 that council can put its feet in the canal 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
 who is no more than a broken family in the north 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.590
 Ketsana has 1200 inhabitants in its twenties 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.970
 but this number goes up to 20,000 people to enjoy life 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.100
 if you know what light it is military takes on against china 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.840
 it is dry and why occasionally 88 again at the end of the afternoon 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.900
 one always fresh behind 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.110
 we can not be bothered by that and two kilometers from the river 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 gradually a damper 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.310
