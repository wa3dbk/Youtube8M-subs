00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
about 14 I think at a time for 13 and he

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.289 
about 14 I think at a time for 13 and he
was<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.310> taking<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.759> mick<00:01:48.909> out<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.119> all<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that good he came with the first team

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.410
