00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.600
 here 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello youtube people then in this 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.620
 video to show you 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.620
 what 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.360
 how they cleaned 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.910
 a saucer remove that opacity that 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.020
 that 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.680
 that opaque layer that comes right through 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:32.029
 of a very simple method that is internal 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.309
 with mustard or with ketchup as we are 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:40.180
 seeing here this dish I have you 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 with youtube 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.090
 why 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.090
 they became opaque 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.930
 will be placed does not leave a layer like 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 opaque the saucer and here I am going to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.860
 show this dish what I just 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.170
 clean with these 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.500
 ibn take away that paco he had and what 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.200
 left crickets and how are you seeing how 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.270
 is reflecting that photo they are 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.270
 there but the end 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.360
 you saw what I just cleaned with the mustard 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.110
 I leave it really clean and shiny and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:30.020
 this goes for the same nonsense so 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:34.820
 opaque and here it's making me nervous 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.060
 by the east as removing the good coat 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.810
 that to clean it they throw the ketchup 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 of mustard 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.230
 and with a napkin if I start it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 release 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.880
 and let it rest for a few minutes 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.580
 and then with a damp cloth they begin to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.990
 remove and then they begin to pass a cloth 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.760
 dry on top he's going to see that the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.730
 saucer is going to go as it will go 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.060
 leaving the 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.860
 the opaque layer that comes out good 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 subscribe and give me I like the video if 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.790
 this served them thank you very much 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.790
