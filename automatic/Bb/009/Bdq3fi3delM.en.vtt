00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hello everyone today will be a bit 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 unusual release in this video I want 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.930
 present you with another variation on 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.750
 What kind of computer can I collect? 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.660
 price of approximately 30 33 thousand 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.669
 rubles the dollar rate changes 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.949
 Computer parts, too, and 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.199
 respectively, the cost is full 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.869
 computer configuration too little 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 changes we already had 2 or 3 videos 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 on the theme of anti-crisis gaming 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.329
 computers 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.220
 but because of the changed situation on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 market respectively and in computers 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.289
 situations also changed and the system we have 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.899
 today is also a little different 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.820
 I will not be too hung up on it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.699
 let's see what it consists of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.769
 from but we will quickly move to the game 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.410
 tests and the biggest surprise 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.859
 what is on this build for an average price 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.839
 35 thousand rubles we will test the player 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.120
 This again I think in this price 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.670
 categories for many users will be 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.620
 this test is interesting and so filling 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.780
 the computer we have is quite good and 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.880
 call it the starting level for the game 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 somehow I just can't do it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.869
 it seems to be something of the original level 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 middle segment and so the processor we have 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.899
 mdf x6 300 it is cooled with a zalman cooler 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.509
 cnps5x it all sits on 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:32.100
 motherboard from gigabyte model 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 gigabyte 970 eldest 3p we don't specifically 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.049
 began to choose a cheap motherboard 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.210
 and chose this rather average 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.670
 price segment to her 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.799
 it was possible to overclock the processor and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
 this system is stable 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.270
 RAM 8 gigabytes 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.299
 mounted on one bar 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 This is a memory from samsung with a frequency of 1600 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.479
 megahertz 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.700
 As for the video card, yes, that's all 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.079
 not bad as I think we 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.820
 set mdr 9 285 in contrast to 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.250
 closest fellows 280 x 280 285 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.920
 built on a new graphic chip this 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.430
 tonga which has a lower 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.469
 heat dissipation and lower mr. 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.170
 consuming hard drive here 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.480
 set to 1 terabyte from the company 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.909
 seagate model dm 003 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.420
 and the whole system is powered by a power supply 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.909
 600 watt cooler master 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.099
 good but rather average block 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.560
 power supply so some outstanding 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.400
 characteristics it is different but for 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.439
 assembly for 30 thousand rubles that is 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.569
 the average price segment of this unit 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.920
 I think quite enough and put more 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.389
 dear here is something 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.269
 it means donating 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.769
 computer performance 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.530
 cooling efficiency or some sort 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.079
 other parameters of the computer were therefore 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.720
 This block is actually selected. 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.090
 selected zalman z12 one of the most 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.849
 available models in this line 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.129
 z and at its low cost it 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.709
 convenient to assemble has a good 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.599
 quality and cooling and more 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.939
 less presentable looks 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.579
 if you buy such a system is not collected 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.590
 that is, individual parts for the most 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.870
 minimum prices Yandex Market 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.959
 that kind of computer can be put together 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.329
 average 30-35 thousand rubles to find out 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.459
 cost in someone's store or order 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.010
 such a computer you can link to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.780
 description under this video find out the name 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.819
 programs that you will see in 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.099
 top left to monitor 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.220
 system can be on the link in the description under 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.109
 this video to record test pieces 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.870
 used a capture card from avermedia 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.329
 so on recording performance 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.849
 The video did not affect this card can 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.979
 record video only at 30 fps therefore 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.310
 I hope you will not have questions why 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:54.049
 video tests are not recorded at 60fps measurements 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.359
 minimum average and maximum 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.669
 vps indexes were produced using 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.069
 built-in benchmark in fraps 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.579
 Well, now turn finally to 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.579
 testing 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.310
 first in line we will have krayzis 3 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.650
 we tested and full hd resolution on 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.110
 high settings but with maximum 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.580
 resolution of textures with smoothing 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.380
 It was exposed two times 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.209
 to measure performance i 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.220
 I already use the well-known 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.130
 a segment that loads well as 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.030
 video card and process 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 video card is used almost 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.370
 the eyeballs processor also even with the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.590
 overclocking to four and a half gigahertz 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.530
 as you see all six processors 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.180
 yager is used to its fullest 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.550
 average fps in krayzis 3 high 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.140
 settings with 2x smoothing 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.310
 according to fraps 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:48.310
 He was 53 and seven tenths entire frame 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.590
 minimum 27 and maximum 124 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.200
 I think a good result for such 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.900
 fairly inexpensive system that already go 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.220
 next and next game on our list 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.720
 testing is quite popular 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.790
 game of world of tanks 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.220
 graphics settings we set our 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.850
 own now you can see them 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.650
 on the screen 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.650
 screen resolution full hd 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.069
 all the data is on your screen so I 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.110
 I think you do not need to comment and 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.210
 I think not worth it again 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.400
 remind about optimization in this game 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.129
 so let's go straight to 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.560
 next similar but more beautiful and 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.099
 more well optimized war game 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.110
 thunder 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.319
 graphics settings in front of you on the screen 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:51.419
 it is practically maximum installation with 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.419
 some disabled special effects 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:40.429
 Well, now finally the test gta 5 on the PC 

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:42.079
 for testing have been installed fresh 

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:44.239
 video drivers for ppm 

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:47.899
 this is a beta driver which is released 

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:52.449
 specifically for this game version 15 and 4 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.449
 graphics settings in front of you on the screen 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.389
 using the built-in program 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:12.139
 forex benchmark we measured indicators 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:16.009
 and they made 43 7 average fps 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:18.339
 32 is minimum and 63 is maximum at 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:21.469
 Overclocking fx from 300 to four and a half 

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:24.079
 gigahertz and when overclocked video card to 

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:26.179
 1000 megahertz in principle I think 

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:28.309
 pretty good especially considering 

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:30.739
 that in the game with optimization is not so 

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:32.959
 smooth well and soon drivers 

00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:34.549
 for a video card it is even better optimized 

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:36.649
 performance some more 

00:07:34.549 --> 00:07:39.769
 will rise well, but on this I have today 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:42.079
 all if this video was useful to you and 

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:44.149
 interesting like like subscribe to 

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:46.189
 channel and write your feedback in 

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:48.409
 comments and I remind you that 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:50.689
 computer can be ordered by reference to 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.619
 Description Thank you all for your attention and to 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:53.619
 meetings in new reviews
