00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.370
 the sierra madre de chiapas is one of the 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.250
 most important lungs of the state is 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.920
 together with the Lacandon jungle the reserve 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.320
 of flora and fauna richest in Mexico and 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.740
 surely the most important of the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.100
 world 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.180
 but in spite of its greatness it is fragile and 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.180
 is threatened 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.350
 its imposing hills are the collectors 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.770
 of large amounts of rain water that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is a source of life and services in addition 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.210
 biodiversity is highlighted in it from 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 delicate fog forests until the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 generous coastal wetlands 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 peaceful ecosystems that provide 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.470
 important services to Chiapas to Mexico 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.690
 and to the world as they contribute to regulate 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.180
 climate prevent the erosion of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 soils reduce the emission of gases from 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
 greenhouse effect and notoriously 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 for the population of the sierra and the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.930
 Costa reduce risks by landslides and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.930
 floods 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.170
 ah 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.759
 such is the importance of the sierra that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.670
 many organizations and institutions 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.219
 have worked for decades to conserve 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.619
 its ecosystems like in no other 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.079
 place of the country in the Sierra Madre de 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.219
 Chiapas are located three reserves of the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.799
 biosphere the triumph the burial and the 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.380
 tacanÃ¡ volcano as well as an area of 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.329
 protection of natural resources the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.039
 frailescana and a conservation area 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 ecological state peak of gold pastal 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.640
 forming a biological system 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.259
 complex in the coastal area this other 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 high biosphere reserve 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.810
 national and international importance 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.030
 the crossroads the connection between 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.310
 rivers and groundwater mantles 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.649
 between the forests of the parties 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.259
 high mountains and ecosystems 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.140
 coastal is what provides us with that 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.940
 ingredient without which life 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.020
 it just does not exist 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.020
 Water 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.230
 and preserve the forests of the sierra 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.450
 mother and the connection with ecosystems 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.360
 coastal areas through bodies of water 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.989
 it is indispensable for the green treasure 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.690
 which is chiapas for those reasons a great 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.819
 number of institutions organizations 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.040
 from civil society communities 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.310
 peasants and producers' cooperatives 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 in various ways have been incorporated into 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.550
 the great work of keeping alive our 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.550
 central cordillera 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.310
 the projects have usually been 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.500
 aimed at addressing the problems 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.330
 derived from the use of 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.790
 soils for agriculture and 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.730
 cattle ranching have gradually gone 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.830
 reducing the rate of deforestation 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.380
 although it is still a serious problem 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.630
 however the scenarios that we have 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.240
 in the face of global climate change and 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.120
 unsustainable economic activities 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.790
 force redouble efforts 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.830
 temperature increase the alteration 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.540
 of rainy seasonality and the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.060
 intensification of cyclones 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.120
 tropical forests threaten the continuity of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.100
 the forests of this region especially the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.050
 provision of quality water and 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.050
 Risk reduction before landslides 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.980
 these scenarios are known but 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.010
 for a year or two a new 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.500
 most reckless threat more devastating 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.490
 succumb to the imposing mountain range 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.260
 central open-pit mining that 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.270
 is increasing in an accelerated way 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.090
 for now in the municipalities of 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.090
 acacoyagua acapetahua escuintla 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.690
 the latent threat of this activity 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.700
 has an urgent objective to extract the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 minerals in the bowels of the sierra 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.110
 to finish with the existing 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.600
 that's why miners work quickly and 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.530
 without rest what in a short time 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.709
 has led to the transformation 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.900
 irreversible landscape and has gone 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.730
 eliminating environmental services and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.280
 raising health risks and 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.280
 food security for the population 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.280
 close 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.919
 According to data from the geological service 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.750
 Mexican mining concessions encompass 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.729
 a large portion of the territory of the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.500
 sierra mother of chiapas and the area 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.460
 coastal 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.590
 unfortunately with consequences 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.690
 bad for the environment because 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 some of these concessions are 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.370
 within protected natural areas and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 the others in sites that connect the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.340
 high parts of the sierra with the 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.340
 coastal ecosystems 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.120
 the scenario is even worse as well as 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.790
 the miners of existing communities of 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.770
 pijijiapan and mapastepec warn about the 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.270
 possible expansion before new 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.270
 concessions in these municipalities 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.600
 to continue protecting our 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.520
 environmental heritage to follow 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.860
 procuring the benefits that it offers us 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.750
 the central mountain range the organizations 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.320
 with conservationist interests in the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.440
 zone we make up the sierra madre alliance 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.270
 with the efforts of each member 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.610
 has documented information that 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.529
 preliminarily throws the following 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.899
 evidences 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.869
 you look at full operation that illustrates in 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:38.179
 a grim scenario affects 

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:40.789
 direct and specific on the relief 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:43.009
 vegetation the passage of fauna and 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:46.939
 contamination of tributaries with minerals 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:49.489
 to the subsoil deep wide pits in 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:54.759
 half of a totally desolate landscape 

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:54.759
 naked without any living organism 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.200
 to continue these activities the 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.960
 environmental problems will increase and we 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.420
 expects biodiversity loss soils 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.970
 poor food poisoning 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.670
 wild and aquatic fauna droughts 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.550
 prolonged extreme temperatures by 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.770
 lack of regulators such as vegetation 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.830
 heavy rains and will be accentuated even more 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.960
 due to erosion the floods and 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.280
 the abandonment of agricultural producers 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.280
 of their own lands 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.950
 thinking about the future gives us only two 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.470
 options 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.540
 allow us to be overwhelmed with all their 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.490
 effects the explorations and mines 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.580
 concessions in the sierra madre 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.039
 or take actions in the present that we 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.979
 give the opportunity to keep alive what 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:49.849
 that by right belongs the sierra 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.849
 mother of chiapas
