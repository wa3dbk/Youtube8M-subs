 These are so strong that they have 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 special requirements for assembling such 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.809
 I used to build 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 special purpose screwdriver 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.500
 which allows not to break the screws and 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 screw them help with the right effort 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.310
 the rack is fixed as you see the whole 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:48.920

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.200
 these rates here 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 which is called crackers 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.050
 Now you can put on this bet 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:31.430
 different profiles but professor and ramp up 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:35.920
 her as you see the six meter profile 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:40.570
 Others can easily handle one person.
