Dhaniya (coriander) - 1 tbsp (ungrinned)

00:01:03.757 --> 00:01:12.342
To make urad dal masala badi, we will grind the species and urad dal coarsely.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:22.456
Place the dal in the jar of mixture grinder and without adding water into the dal we will grind the dal.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.522

00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:46.393

00:02:14.737 --> 00:02:18.365
Dal and species are ready; now mix
the species into dal. Add 1-2

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:34.140
tsp of water into the heeng, stir
it well and mix it with dal.

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:57.615
Now beat the dal rigorsly for 5-6 minutes
to make it fluffy and add 3-4 tsp

00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:21.761
water so that it becomes little thin.
Dal is ready and looking fluffy.

00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:25.006

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.720
Badiya are ready, now we will dry them.

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:25.738
The best time to prepare badiya is of May and June because the sunlight in these months is maximum.

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:31.265
It takes 2 days to dry the badiya well.

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:35.553
On first day prepare them around 11 in the morning so
that they can be dried evenly in the entire day and

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:45.091
can be turned upside down and for the second day they
are dried in the sunlight from morning to evening.

00:04:45.548 --> 00:04:50.095
It takes complete 2 days to dry these badiya properly.

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.140
We will now place the badiya in the sunlight.

00:04:55.081 --> 00:05:03.100
Urad dal masala badi is ready and now they can be stored in a container.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.836
