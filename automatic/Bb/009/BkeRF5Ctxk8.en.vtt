gigabyte I'm actually glad I didn't get
the<00:00:22.800> smallest<00:00:23.189> size<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.539> loaded

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the smallest size because I've loaded

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
the smallest size because I've loaded
this<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.490> apps<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.029> also

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this up not just with apps but also

to be I decided my my device of choice

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000 
to be I decided my my device of choice
for<00:00:35.910> traveling<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> mostly<00:00:36.930> because<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
for traveling and mostly because of the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
for traveling and mostly because of the
size<00:00:38.219> here's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> standard<00:00:39.420> iPad<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
size here's a standard iPad this is the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.250 
size here's a standard iPad this is the
third<00:00:40.530> generation<00:00:40.710> ipad<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.989> mini

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
third generation ipad and and the mini

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.459 
third generation ipad and and the mini
it<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.520> fits<00:00:44.850> into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.570> screen<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it actually fits into the screen of the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.010 
it actually fits into the screen of the
original<00:00:47.070> iPad<00:00:47.460> with<00:00:48.000> room<00:00:48.239> left<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.719> it's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
original iPad with room left over it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.930 
original iPad with room left over it's
about<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.379> wide<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> screen<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> maybe<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
about as wide as a screen and maybe a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080 
about as wide as a screen and maybe a
half-inch<00:00:51.809> shorter<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:53.579> gives<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> some

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
half-inch shorter that gives you some

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
half-inch shorter that gives you some
idea<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> difference<00:00:55.280> instead<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> being

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
idea of the difference instead of being

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
idea of the difference instead of being
nine<00:00:56.789> point<00:00:57.090> seven<00:00:57.270> inches<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> iPad<00:00:58.170> Mini<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
nine point seven inches the iPad Mini is

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.439 
nine point seven inches the iPad Mini is
seven<00:00:58.890> point<00:00:59.190> nine<00:00:59.280> inches<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.359> some

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
seven point nine inches there are some

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.860 
seven point nine inches there are some
other<00:01:00.629> sacrifices<00:01:01.050> too<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.480> slower

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
other sacrifices too it is a slower

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520 
other sacrifices too it is a slower
processor<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.760> iPad<00:01:06.180> 2<00:01:06.750> battery

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
processor more like an iPad 2 battery

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280 
processor more like an iPad 2 battery
life's<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> biggest

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
life's about the same but the biggest

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.550 
life's about the same but the biggest
loss<00:01:10.680> frankly<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.090> screen<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.659> don't

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
loss frankly is the screen I don't

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
loss frankly is the screen I don't
really<00:01:13.710> understand<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.310> Apple<00:01:14.640> didn't<00:01:14.880> make

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
really understand why Apple didn't make

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
really understand why Apple didn't make
the<00:01:15.299> ipad<00:01:15.659> mini<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.960> Retina<00:01:16.590> Display<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.460> isn't

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the ipad mini a Retina Display it isn't

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
the ipad mini a Retina Display it isn't
it's<00:01:17.850> 1024<00:01:18.540> x<00:01:19.110> 768<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.040> guess<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.549> probably

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it's 1024 x 768 I guess that's probably

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's 1024 x 768 I guess that's probably
how<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.509> kept<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> price<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.740> low

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
how they kept the price a little bit low

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.999 
how they kept the price a little bit low
but<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:24.150> you're<00:01:24.659> used<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> Retina<00:01:25.560> display

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
but if you're used to a Retina display

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.810 
but if you're used to a Retina display
as<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.640> am<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.119> my<00:01:27.299> iPad<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
as I am with my iPad you're going to

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.649 
as I am with my iPad you're going to
notice<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.390> jaggi<00:01:31.759> text<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> read<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
notice the jaggi text when you read and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
notice the jaggi text when you read and
and<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> look<00:01:34.439> closely<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.009> games<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and when you look closely on games and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.380 
and when you look closely on games and
things<00:01:36.380> having<00:01:37.380> said<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.000> because<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
things having said that because it's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.340 
things having said that because it's
only<00:01:40.110> 10<00:01:40.409> 25<00:01:40.799> bar<00:01:40.979> 768<00:01:41.729> 1024<00:01:42.270> x<00:01:42.390> 768<00:01:42.810> it's

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
only 10 25 bar 768 1024 x 768 it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
only 10 25 bar 768 1024 x 768 it's
snappy<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.100> fast<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:44.939> notice<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
snappy it's fast you don't notice the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.170 
snappy it's fast you don't notice the
lack<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> processor<00:01:46.799> speed<00:01:47.130> by<00:01:47.340> any<00:01:47.610> means<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
lack of processor speed by any means and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
lack of processor speed by any means and
I'm<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.990> seeing<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.470> as<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> content

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'm really seeing this as a content

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
I'm really seeing this as a content
consumption<00:01:51.119> device<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:52.110> than<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> content

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
consumption device more than a content

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
consumption device more than a content
creation<00:01:53.280> device<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.720> small<00:01:54.960> enough

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
creation device it's just small enough

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.870 
creation device it's just small enough
that<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.500> probably<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> type<00:01:56.640> on

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
that you probably don't want to type on

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.170 
that you probably don't want to type on
the<00:01:57.030> keyboard<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.689> whole<00:01:58.469> heck<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.180> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
