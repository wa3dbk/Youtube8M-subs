one and phase want a member and he jumps
into<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.340> tank<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> few<00:00:31.109> things

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
into a tank now there's a few things

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.659 
into a tank now there's a few things
about<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.619> tank<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.099> need<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.399> aware<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
about this tank you need to be aware of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.610 
about this tank you need to be aware of
first<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.930> he<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.260> ability<00:00:34.410> called

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
first thing is he has an ability called

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.130 
first thing is he has an ability called
shock<00:00:35.100> blast<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:36.090> shock<00:00:36.360> blast<00:00:36.540> hits<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
shock blast now shock blast hits for a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
shock blast now shock blast hits for a
 ton<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.770> damage<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.210> probably<00:00:39.629> need

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
 ton of damage and you probably need

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.450 
 ton of damage and you probably need
to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> using<00:00:40.469> defensive<00:00:40.890> cooldowns<00:00:41.010> right

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to be using defensive cooldowns right

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.150 
to be using defensive cooldowns right
before<00:00:41.820> he<00:00:42.000> casted<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> cast<00:00:43.590> bar<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
before he casted it as a cast bar so you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
before he casted it as a cast bar so you
can<00:00:44.250> prepare<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:45.030> stone<00:00:45.270> board<00:00:45.629> whatever

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
can prepare your stone board whatever

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.220 
can prepare your stone board whatever
you<00:00:46.110> need<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.530> order<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.660> negate<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> damage

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you need in order to negate that damage

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
you need in order to negate that damage
but<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.430> thing<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.120> tank<00:00:51.449> mode<00:00:51.690> has

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
but the other thing this tank mode has

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
but the other thing this tank mode has
is<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> has<00:00:52.320> fired<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> ground<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:54.090> avoid

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is it has fired on the ground just avoid

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.470 
is it has fired on the ground just avoid
the<00:00:54.420> fire<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.960> normally<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
the fire as you normally would and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
the fire as you normally would and
attempt<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> negate<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> damage

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
attempt to negate some of the damage

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
attempt to negate some of the damage
from<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> shock<00:00:59.460> blast<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.149> phase

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
from the shock blast and this phase

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
from the shock blast and this phase
should<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> pretty<00:01:00.899> easy<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.239> phase<00:01:03.239> two

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
should be pretty easy for you phase two

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
should be pretty easy for you phase two
of<00:01:03.539> numeral<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> phase<00:01:04.739> 2<00:01:04.979> mineral<00:01:05.460> jumps

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
of numeral and phase 2 mineral jumps

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
of numeral and phase 2 mineral jumps
into<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> turret<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.740> turret<00:01:08.189> has<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> lot

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
into a turret now this turret has a lot

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.950 
into a turret now this turret has a lot
of<00:01:08.580> mechanics<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.420> common<00:01:09.630> sense

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
of mechanics that are just common sense

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.170 
of mechanics that are just common sense
the<00:01:10.650> main<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> fact<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> turret

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the main one is the fact that the turret

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
the main one is the fact that the turret
aims<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> specific<00:01:12.869> direction<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.710> fires

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
aims in a specific direction and fires

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
aims in a specific direction and fires
bullets<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.970> not<00:01:15.150> stand<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> direction

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
bullets do not stand in the direction

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
bullets do not stand in the direction
the<00:01:16.530> turret<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.950> shooting<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the turret of shooting because you will

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.090 
the turret of shooting because you will
take<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> damage<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> bolts<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
take the damage for the bolts what you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
take the damage for the bolts what you
do<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:21.360> around<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.960> turret<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
do is you just go around the turret and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.170 
do is you just go around the turret and
you<00:01:22.530> stand<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> direction<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you stand in the direction which is not

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.260 
you stand in the direction which is not
shooting<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.009> other<00:01:26.189> interesting<00:01:26.340> thing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
shooting now the other interesting thing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
shooting now the other interesting thing
about<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.689> phase<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.490> an

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
about this phase is that there is an

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.640 
about this phase is that there is an
ability<00:01:29.880> called<00:01:30.060> rocket<00:01:30.780> strike<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.439> you'll

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
ability called rocket strike now you'll

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.859 
ability called rocket strike now you'll
see<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:32.009> walking<00:01:32.850> around<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
see me walking around just because I

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
see me walking around just because I
want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.500> aware<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:35.280> where<00:01:35.430> these

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
want to be aware of actually where these

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.090 
want to be aware of actually where these
land<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> small<00:01:37.110> red<00:01:37.409> circle<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
land it is a small red circle now the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.520 
land it is a small red circle now the
small<00:01:38.610> red<00:01:38.850> circle<00:01:39.299> what<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.079> does<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.409> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
small red circle what it does if you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770 
small red circle what it does if you
stand<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.250> get<00:01:41.430> one<00:01:41.610> shot<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.119> think

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
stand in it you get one shot I think

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.149 
stand in it you get one shot I think
maybe<00:01:43.049> gear<00:01:43.380> tanks<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.950> able<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
maybe gear tanks would be able to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
maybe gear tanks would be able to
survive<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> took<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.570> hit<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
survive it but when I took the hit it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.249 
survive it but when I took the hit it
hit<00:01:46.380> me<00:01:46.590> for<00:01:46.970> 500,000<00:01:47.970> now<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.200> than

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hit me for 500,000 now that is more than

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
hit me for 500,000 now that is more than
my<00:01:49.649> health<00:01:49.829> pool<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:50.759> obvious<00:01:50.939> one

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
my health pool and it's an obvious one

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.280 
my health pool and it's an obvious one
shot<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.799> unless<00:01:53.070> you're<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> girt<00:01:53.640> ank<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
shot to me so unless you're a girt ank I

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.749 
shot to me so unless you're a girt ank I
strongly<00:01:55.290> advise<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.710> look<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
strongly advise you look around on the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.999 
strongly advise you look around on the
ground<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> potential<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
ground because you have the potential to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
ground because you have the potential to
be<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.369> shot<00:01:59.729> phase<00:02:00.090> three<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.810> are<00:02:00.960> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
be one shot phase three of them are on

and phase through a member on he jumps

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.609 
and phase through a member on he jumps
into<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.939> helicopter<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.229> helicopter

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
into a helicopter now this helicopter

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
into a helicopter now this helicopter
can<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.130> taken<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> sky<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> can

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
can be taken out of the sky and it can

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.940 
can be taken out of the sky and it can
be<00:02:06.750> Auto<00:02:06.930> Attack<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.619> directly

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
be Auto Attack if you're directly

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.639 
be Auto Attack if you're directly
underneath

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
underneath

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.889 
underneath
but<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.549> cannot<00:02:09.879> be<00:02:10.060> attacked<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:10.509> melee

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
but it cannot be attacked with melee

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.780 
but it cannot be attacked with melee
abilities<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.590> know<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.099> doesn't<00:02:12.220> make<00:02:12.459> much

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
abilities I know that doesn't make much

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.009 
abilities I know that doesn't make much
sense<00:02:12.849> it<00:02:13.299> didn't<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:13.599> make<00:02:13.780> much<00:02:13.989> sense

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
sense it didn't really make much sense

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.839 
sense it didn't really make much sense
to<00:02:14.290> me<00:02:14.439> either<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.459> really<00:02:15.610> need<00:02:15.819> to

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
to me either but if you really need to

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.100 
to me either but if you really need to
you<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.180> treat<00:02:16.299> them<00:02:16.450> up<00:02:16.510> lighting<00:02:16.840> bolts

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
you can treat them up lighting bolts

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.009 
you can treat them up lighting bolts
whatever<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:17.439> really<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.750> part

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
whatever you really do but in this part

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.630 
whatever you really do but in this part
of<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.170> days<00:02:20.349> there<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.860> something<00:02:21.310> there's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
of the days there is something there's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.280 
of the days there is something there's
an<00:02:21.760> ad<00:02:21.909> that<00:02:21.939> spawns<00:02:22.540> call<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> Salt<00:02:23.200> bog

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
an ad that spawns call to the Salt bog

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.559 
an ad that spawns call to the Salt bog
now<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.159> this<00:02:24.280> assault<00:02:24.610> lot<00:02:24.849> does<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.420> it

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
now what this assault lot does is it

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.360 
now what this assault lot does is it
drops<00:02:25.900> an<00:02:26.109> item<00:02:26.379> called<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.620> magnetic<00:02:27.069> core

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
drops an item called the magnetic core

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.610 
drops an item called the magnetic core
now<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:28.329> magnetic<00:02:28.689> horror<00:02:29.049> wiser<00:02:29.290> do

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
now what this magnetic horror wiser do

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
now what this magnetic horror wiser do
is<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:30.220> allows<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.640> pull<00:02:30.819> him<00:02:30.970> from<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is it allows you to pull him from the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.119 
is it allows you to pull him from the
sky<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> increases<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.379> damage<00:02:32.620> he<00:02:32.890> takes

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
sky and it increases the damage he takes

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.910 
sky and it increases the damage he takes
by<00:02:33.280> fifty<00:02:33.609> percent<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:35.049> see<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.739> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
by fifty percent if you see and this I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.559 
by fifty percent if you see and this I
made<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.129> mistake<00:02:36.280> myself<00:02:36.670> i<00:02:37.000> tempted<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.420> grab

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
made a mistake myself i tempted to grab

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.319 
made a mistake myself i tempted to grab
to<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.829> unfortunate<00:02:39.459> thing<00:02:39.609> about<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:40.090> is

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
to the unfortunate thing about this is

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.390 
to the unfortunate thing about this is
they<00:02:40.659> get<00:02:40.810> disabled<00:02:41.349> after<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:41.829> minute<00:02:41.980> so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
they get disabled after one minute so

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680 
they get disabled after one minute so
you<00:02:42.430> have<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.970> minute<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.299> use<00:02:43.540> these

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
you have one minute to use these

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.180 
you have one minute to use these
magnetic<00:02:44.200> cores<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.620> pulling<00:02:44.920> out<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.129> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
magnetic cores and pulling out of the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.910 
magnetic cores and pulling out of the
sky<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.720> generally<00:02:47.349> takes<00:02:47.379> about<00:02:47.620> two

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
sky so it generally takes about two

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920 
sky so it generally takes about two
magnetic<00:02:48.220> cores<00:02:48.549> to<00:02:48.730> kill<00:02:48.909> him<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.690> still

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
magnetic cores to kill him you can still

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.990 
magnetic cores to kill him you can still
do<00:02:50.049> your<00:02:50.139> auto<00:02:50.319> attack<00:02:50.650> melee<00:02:51.010> thing<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.819> make

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
do your auto attack melee thing but make

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.640 
do your auto attack melee thing but make
sure<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.269> kill<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.599> saltbox<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.500> they

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
sure you kill as a saltbox because they

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.339 
sure you kill as a saltbox because they
will<00:02:53.769> help<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.069> quite<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> bit<00:02:54.689> phase<00:02:55.689> four<00:02:56.019> and

the<00:03:31.989> boss<00:03:32.139> in<00:03:32.440> a<00:03:32.919> decent<00:03:33.400> amount<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.669> time<00:03:33.819> now

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the boss in a decent amount of time now

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.750 
the boss in a decent amount of time now
how<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.019> boss<00:03:35.230> actually<00:03:35.500> works<00:03:35.889> is<00:03:36.159> you<00:03:36.549> have

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
how this boss actually works is you have

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.909 
how this boss actually works is you have
to<00:03:36.909> kill<00:03:37.090> everything<00:03:37.449> within<00:03:38.319> about<00:03:38.650> ten

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
to kill everything within about ten

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.909 
to kill everything within about ten
seconds<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.430> each<00:03:39.579> other<00:03:39.699> I<00:03:39.849> believe<00:03:40.209> now<00:03:40.989> one

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
seconds of each other I believe now one

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.770 
seconds of each other I believe now one
of<00:03:41.949> them<00:03:42.159> cannot<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.909> attacked<00:03:43.299> by<00:03:43.389> melee

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
of them cannot be attacked by melee

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.479 
of them cannot be attacked by melee
attacks<00:03:44.019> unless<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.409> are<00:03:44.530> dead<00:03:44.829> center<00:03:45.280> dead

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
attacks unless you are dead center dead

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.640 
attacks unless you are dead center dead
close<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.750> recommend<00:03:46.840> doing<00:03:47.349> is

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
close so what I recommend doing is

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.319 
close so what I recommend doing is
attacking<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.190> head<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.489> bring<00:03:48.699> it<00:03:48.909> down<00:03:48.940> to

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
attacking the head and bring it down to

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.149 
attacking the head and bring it down to
five<00:03:49.569> percent<00:03:50.109> with<00:03:50.470> your<00:03:50.680> ascendance

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
five percent with your ascendance

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.520 
five percent with your ascendance
building<00:03:51.609> now<00:03:52.419> if<00:03:52.750> once<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.139> do<00:03:53.349> this

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
building now if once you do this

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.050 
building now if once you do this
everything<00:03:54.159> else<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.639> just<00:03:54.819> mail<00:03:55.030> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
everything else you can just mail a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.369 
everything else you can just mail a
straight<00:03:55.449> up<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:55.810> just<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.139> what<00:03:56.260> you

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
straight up and just do what you

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.500 
straight up and just do what you
normally<00:03:56.409> do<00:03:56.859> so<00:03:57.519> once<00:03:57.699> you<00:03:57.790> get<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.299> five

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
normally do so once you get that to five

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.599 
normally do so once you get that to five
percent<00:03:58.870> help<00:03:59.049> i<00:03:59.260> would<00:03:59.349> go<00:03:59.709> ahead<00:03:59.829> and<00:04:00.010> get<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
percent help i would go ahead and get a

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.240 
percent help i would go ahead and get a
turret<00:04:00.970> down<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.329> five<00:04:01.510> percent<00:04:01.870> health<00:04:02.079> so<00:04:02.829> i

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
turret down to five percent health so i

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.530 
turret down to five percent health so i
guess<00:04:03.669> that's<00:04:03.849> probably<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> second<00:04:04.419> hardest

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
guess that's probably the second hardest

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.080 
guess that's probably the second hardest
part<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:05.349> then<00:04:06.129> get<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> tank<00:04:06.579> down<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.940> five

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
part and then get the tank down to five

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.149 
part and then get the tank down to five
percent<00:04:07.479> help<00:04:07.629> and<00:04:07.840> then<00:04:08.319> you<00:04:08.379> can<00:04:08.530> kill<00:04:08.709> all

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
percent help and then you can kill all

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.550 
percent help and then you can kill all
of<00:04:09.220> them<00:04:09.459> at<00:04:09.609> once<00:04:09.930> anyway<00:04:10.930> guys<00:04:11.109> I<00:04:11.349> hope<00:04:11.379> you
