00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.230
 Hello everyone and today we have such 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.089
 huge package wrapped 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.800
 here we have the goods from the store t mar 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.810
 I used to be on it in this store 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.619
 I ordered but for a long time somehow I do not know 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.730
 forgot about him that here and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:32.340
 recently somewhere about twenty days ago 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 I received a letter that it is March big 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 sales and discounts 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.579
 Well, I think I forgot about this store. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.820
 need to go in and choose something for yourself and 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.820
 I chose 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:01:02.430
 small you can say home street 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:05.280
 quadrocopter here let's hide look 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.470
 already there the damage was okay mean 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.470
 quadrocopter quadrocopter dji 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:24.140
 1000 or 2000 up to the bear box 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.200
 crumpled here is such a quadrocopter well yes 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.840
 a little bit wrong jay isr si jay 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.549
 jay thousands 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:41.070
 here's a box before crushed 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 March, the bag is nothing else then 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.439
 March a little bit did not insure not 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.140
 stuck no foam 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.730
 Okay, the main thing is that the quadcopter itself was 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:02.400
 not damaged 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.400
 so here I will see sticking out already one stick and 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.710
 the battery is all in the box more 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 nothing but instruction means 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:24.580
 j-1000 us in english and chinese 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.860
 language it is happy that is, if something 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.680
 it won't be clear we can sit behind 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 dictionary and translate so battery u 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:53.230
 we are going to 250 milliamps very 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 small seas up to 10 need a coupler from there 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:11.700
 so we remove about the Turk we well 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.440
 simple that is generally simple 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 mean so we have a button 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.770
 Separately photo separately video but on this 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.870
 this quadcopter no camera 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.350
 nothing else there is flips and 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.900
 there is speed 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:35.890
 well i think this mod is changing mods i 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:39.130
 I think here is a little paprika screwdriver in 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.350
 no screwdriver set so we are waiting 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.720
 I'll go for a screwdriver now. I 'm back with 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.640
 screwdriver now we know well I think 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:56.290
 here are four batteries no more judging by 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:57.340
 size bolt hefty there like me 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.680
 said four batteries 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.250
 insert our four chinese 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.250
 battery 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:30.450
 one two three all work lcd so 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.450
 buttons work 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.470
 close turn off for now let 's figure it out 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.480
 with our quadcopter it means so i 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.600
 I think it is in front of us for 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.910
 the race is not bad 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.010
 below we have foam which under 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.640
 boards that can land well and 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.470
 home protection 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.360
 by the way if you want outside on 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:07.900
 run then i recommend unprotecting i 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.720
 I think not only that it will not save much 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:21.750
 but it will still interfere by the way 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:25.030
 charging and so overlooked a little 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:29.760
 we still have spare screws 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:33.490
 and charge the battery is charging from 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:39.190
 simple set for example charging from 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:43.470
 the phone and itâ€™s for my computer and go 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:46.540
 charge like this 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.430
 let's put a look maybe he 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:54.040
 charged and we will run it as well 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.710
 just insert it immediately it turns on 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.430
 that is, there are no buttons 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.700
 there is no such thing 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.720
 the wire will stick out well, nothing terrible 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:10.480
 it will not affect flight performance 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:14.620
 how to turn on our equipment is contact 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:18.640
 and as I said sleeps and it changes 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:24.220
 expenses 60100 4060 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:32.320
 well let's 40 quietly work now 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:42.100
 try to fly a little bit here 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:46.300
 for this and need protection not needed 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:49.360
 it turns out so now everything means him 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.940
 under charge we go to run it 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.640
 I think this will be the next video all 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:59.460
