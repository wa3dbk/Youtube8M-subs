more<00:00:23.939> item<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.480> figured<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.080> since<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.680> have

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
more item I figured that since I have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
more item I figured that since I have
and<00:00:26.220> think<00:00:26.460> Sam<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.910> talk<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.510> that

that bandwagon why not and the the whole
thing<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:15.030> very<00:01:15.509> convoluted<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.070> honest

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

killing

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
killing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.730 
killing
how<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:20.670> easier<00:01:21.180> gun<00:01:21.509> devices<00:01:22.110> had<00:01:22.409> came

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
how more easier gun devices had came

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.539 
how more easier gun devices had came
along<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.880> awarding<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.400> like<00:01:28.549> warning

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
along and how awarding to like warning

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.050 
along and how awarding to like warning
to<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.710> powerglove<00:01:31.710> standards<00:01:32.369> heal<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
to like powerglove standards heal so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
to like powerglove standards heal so
basically<00:01:33.570> similar<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.259> power<00:01:34.619> glove<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
basically similar to the power glove you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
basically similar to the power glove you
would<00:01:35.759> put<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.180> sensors<00:01:36.780> around<00:01:37.229> your

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
would put these sensors around your

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
would put these sensors around your
television<00:01:38.100> set<00:01:39.049> they<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.520> little<00:01:41.520> bendy

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
television set they have a little bendy

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.819 
television set they have a little bendy
things<00:01:42.119> about<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> few

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
things about it so you had a few

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
things about it so you had a few
different<00:01:44.130> ways<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.360> move<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.509> around<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
different ways to move them around you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
different ways to move them around you
know<00:01:46.259> television<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> would

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
know television that and you would

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.139 
know television that and you would
connect<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:49.500> USB<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.090> ps3<00:01:52.460> which<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
connect it USB to your ps3 which if you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.240 
connect it USB to your ps3 which if you
have<00:01:54.299> told<00:01:54.570> could<00:01:55.200> tell<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> piece<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.000> sweet

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
have told could tell is a piece of sweet

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.090 
have told could tell is a piece of sweet
yeah

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
yeah

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.390 
yeah
then<00:02:00.880> once<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.810> get<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:01.960> sup<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:03.130> again

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
then once you get that sup you again

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.120 
then once you get that sup you again
would<00:02:03.640> connect<00:02:03.939> you<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.330> speed<00:02:04.689> design<00:02:05.049> li<00:02:05.530> to

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
would connect you a speed design li to

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.609 
would connect you a speed design li to
your<00:02:06.250> television<00:02:06.580> pull<00:02:07.090> your<00:02:07.240> gun<00:02:07.600> com2<00:02:08.500> we

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
your television pull your gun com2 we

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.229 
your television pull your gun com2 we
which<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.869> very<00:02:10.869> odd<00:02:11.140> let's<00:02:11.770> move<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.120> we

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
which is very odd let's move up so we

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.750 
which is very odd let's move up so we
can<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> lot<00:02:14.319> easier<00:02:16.050> now<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.560> has<00:02:17.709> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
can see this a lot easier now it has a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.570 
can see this a lot easier now it has a
side<00:02:18.760> handle<00:02:19.270> heel<00:02:19.540> two<00:02:20.380> analog<00:02:20.800> sticks<00:02:20.860> one

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
side handle heel two analog sticks one

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.750 
side handle heel two analog sticks one
my<00:02:22.060> heel<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.500> back<00:02:23.739> which<00:02:24.160> was<00:02:24.370> like

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
my heel one on the back which was like

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.970 
my heel one on the back which was like
the<00:02:24.970> gun<00:02:25.150> con<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.989> gun<00:02:26.170> con<00:02:26.440> two<00:02:26.709> was

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the gun con to the gun con two was

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.070 
the gun con to the gun con two was
basically<00:02:27.370> destroy<00:02:28.300> this<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:31.080> few
