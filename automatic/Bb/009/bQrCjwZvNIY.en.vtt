00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
wheat as much next year chop up your

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.380 
wheat as much next year chop up your
leaves<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> mulch<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
leaves and use them as a mulch in the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
leaves and use them as a mulch in the
garden<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.350> throw<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.920> down

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
garden don't just throw them down

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.830 
garden don't just throw them down
because<00:01:50.460> they'll<00:01:50.759> tend<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> mat<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
because they'll tend to mat down and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
because they'll tend to mat down and
they<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.079> rot<00:01:52.290> things<00:01:52.619> ornamental<00:01:53.130> grasses<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
they can rot things ornamental grasses I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.149 
they can rot things ornamental grasses I
actually<00:01:54.030> tie<00:01:54.329> them<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.049> tie<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
actually tie them up I tie them up and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
actually tie them up I tie them up and
that<00:01:56.939> helps<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> give<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.689> winter<00:01:58.079> interest

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that helps to give me winter interest

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.139 
that helps to give me winter interest
all<00:01:58.710> year<00:01:58.950> long<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.640> tie<00:01:59.850> them<00:02:00.030> when

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

the first snowfall comes the grasses

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
the first snowfall comes the grasses
tend<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> flop<00:02:02.729> over<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.540> almost

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
tend to flop over and they get almost

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569
