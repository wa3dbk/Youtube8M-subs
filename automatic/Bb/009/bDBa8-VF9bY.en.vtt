00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.409

 3g that works with all carriers 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.670
 from brazil come up here for you guys 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.670
 look at re-election 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 here we had first 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.460
 charger and charger that comes with 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.509
 with st 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.140
 Let's leave the barracks too short. 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.820
 especially if you do not have any 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 mobile phone taken to go back to 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.360
 carry is more than what happens 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.709
 You always have to use a 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.760
 extension at the time you need to load the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.050
 appliance 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:29.300
 we have here one where we saw that people 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:32.390
 Traditional having with 13 points 5 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 millimeter known as p2 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.320
 I do not prefer the other challenge of others. 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.900
 are those irregular shape 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.370
 here was the chip and that came with it but 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.270
 as I already have my son who is from 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:52.340
 part need not use that has the guide 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.560
 fast a fan was left for him on the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.090
 ground and normal crying 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.799
 and here's little tax on the hour shows 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.920
 with you a little now the device here 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.200
 has some programs already installed by 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.810
 example they have direct access to 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.090
 with the applications you can 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.989
 download when the message clock on the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.670
 facebook whatsapp gmail that I always 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.280
 I liked it physically, not here in my land. 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.790
 primary because what I use most 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.769
 daily in some games that I already 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.870
 I installed because it does not come with games 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.209
 installed and practically nothing comes 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:40.760
 installed you have to do the whole 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:42.709
 The information you need is not very 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.780
 high and another has gone so far 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.000
 usually only happens to the fort here in 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.880
 front and do not play too loud but 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.600
 as heard it's super quiet it 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.549
 has a gps and when browser does not 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.140
 You will be able to find anything that I'm without 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.680
 My father was always turned on when he 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.010
 it's coming 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.219
 for now I will not call and just to 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.469
 You guys do not look hard when you're alone. 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.609
 has a very fast wall processor 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.680
 no luge alex point has a radio 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:19.259
 which in audio play stock already comes 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.259
 installed on it you already have something chronic 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.070
 and a cool device , how do you like it? 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.139
 cost benefit when I get the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.400
 unit was costing 249 reais 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.169
 currently the market is costing around 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.150
 of 399 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.030
 so it's up to you that you want 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.130
 to get a device to judge if it 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.250
 you the cost benefit is legal 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.229
 these are mine, shall we say so my 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:53.169
 opinion on the mobile shows 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.539
 the micro usb cable input and the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.139
 Earphone 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:04.210
 it has a metallic plastic cover 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:09.580
 but it's not mine I believe it's 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:15.250
 in black matte and heretofore one of 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.620
 3.5 inches get a price of 249 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.510
 but is currently costing around 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.070
 399 reais for me was the benefit because 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.680
 It's very difficult for you, after all. 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:38.639
 find a device with android where 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:41.409
 Do you have a good camera androni device? 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.530
 you will hardly find one with 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:48.909
 a good camera for less than 350 reais 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.889
 if you have any questions about the 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.620
 device or want to add some 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.810
 thing may ask and and soon 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.550

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.680

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.110
