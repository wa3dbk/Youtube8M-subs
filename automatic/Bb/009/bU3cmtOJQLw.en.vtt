I've learned from other people and I've
planted<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.850> plan<00:01:03.359> way<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.840> seeds<00:01:04.140> than

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
planted I plan way more seeds than

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
planted I plan way more seeds than
anyone<00:01:05.610> would<00:01:05.729> ever<00:01:05.790> suspect<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
anyone would ever suspect you know that

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
anyone would ever suspect you know that
way<00:01:07.590> more<00:01:07.830> than<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.250> Sepp<00:01:08.580> Holzer<00:01:08.729> says

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
way more than you think Sepp Holzer says

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
way more than you think Sepp Holzer says
you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.619> you're<00:01:10.740> playing<00:01:10.920> ten

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you know you go when you're playing ten

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250 
you know you go when you're playing ten
times<00:01:11.400> more<00:01:11.610> seeds<00:01:11.909> than<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
times more seeds than you think you you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.899 
times more seeds than you think you you
should<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.070> after<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
should then after that you go back and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.620 
should then after that you go back and
plant<00:01:15.270> 10<00:01:15.450> times<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> can't<00:01:18.119> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
plant 10 times more so you can't really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
plant 10 times more so you can't really
reap<00:01:19.049> what<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.680> sell<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.490> want
