using it to Kim but like I said the left

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
using it to Kim but like I said the left
gun<00:00:28.619> does<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.010> make<00:00:29.160> any<00:00:29.340> sound<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.060> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
gun does not make any sound so if you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.240 
gun does not make any sound so if you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
shoot that one just alone without

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
shoot that one just alone without
shooting<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> right<00:00:32.850> one<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.270> doesn't<00:00:33.540> make

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
shooting the right one it doesn't make

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.910 
shooting the right one it doesn't make
any<00:00:33.809> sounds<00:00:34.320> which<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> funny

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
any sounds which is kind of funny

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.560 
any sounds which is kind of funny
because<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.180> does<00:00:36.329> everything

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
because it you know it does everything

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.090 
because it you know it does everything
else<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.989> has<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> animations<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
else it has the animations and all that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.440 
else it has the animations and all that
kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> stuff<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
kind of stuff but as you can see when I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
kind of stuff but as you can see when I
shoot<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.899> there<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> no<00:00:41.040> sound<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
shoot it there is no sound at all so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.150 
shoot it there is no sound at all so
this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.000> why<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> call<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> silent<00:00:42.899> shot<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.750 
setting up the akimbo attachment because
you<00:04:27.690> can't<00:04:27.870> use<00:04:28.020> both<00:04:28.200> guns<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:28.860> at<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.580> same

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
you can't use both guns but at the same

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.640 
you can't use both guns but at the same
time<00:04:29.940> it's<00:04:30.180> like<00:04:30.240> having<00:04:30.630> one<00:04:30.900> MP<00:04:31.230> nine<00:04:31.410> and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
time it's like having one MP nine and

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.980 
time it's like having one MP nine and
then<00:04:31.740> just<00:04:31.890> hip<00:04:32.070> firing<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.550> I'm<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.870> then

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
then just hip firing it I'm and then

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.260 
then just hip firing it I'm and then
having<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.380> make<00:04:34.530> no<00:04:34.740> sound<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.280> pretty<00:04:36.060> much<00:04:36.210> a

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
having it make no sound so pretty much a

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.790 
having it make no sound so pretty much a
silencer<00:04:36.840> except<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.410> don't<00:04:37.500> get<00:04:37.680> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
silencer except you don't get the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.230 
silencer except you don't get the
silence<00:04:38.160> effect<00:04:38.520> and<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.030> don't<00:04:39.060> know

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
silence effect and it's I don't know

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.700 
silence effect and it's I don't know
it's<00:04:39.390> just<00:04:39.480> kind<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.780> weird<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.530> pretty

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
it's just kind of weird it's a pretty

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.790 
it's just kind of weird it's a pretty
cool<00:04:41.010> idea<00:04:41.280> i<00:04:41.520> guess<00:04:41.790> i<00:04:41.910> came<00:04:42.090> up<00:04:42.210> with<00:04:42.390> but

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
cool idea i guess i came up with but

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.070 
cool idea i guess i came up with but
whatever<00:04:43.800> i<00:04:44.100> don't<00:04:44.250> know<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:45.480> know<00:04:45.600> um

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
whatever i don't know that you know um

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.880 
whatever i don't know that you know um
and<00:04:47.210> yet<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.390> that's<00:04:48.570> pretty<00:04:48.750> much<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.960> I<00:04:49.560> don't

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
and yet so that's pretty much it I don't

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.290 
and yet so that's pretty much it I don't
think<00:04:49.950> they'll<00:04:50.250> ever<00:04:50.280> fix<00:04:50.760> this<00:04:50.940> kind<00:04:51.240> of

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
think they'll ever fix this kind of

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.180 
think they'll ever fix this kind of
glitch<00:04:51.570> or<00:04:51.720> patch<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.500> or<00:04:52.680> anything<00:04:52.890> like<00:04:53.070> that
