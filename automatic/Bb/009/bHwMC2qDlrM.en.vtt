00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.109
 the transmitter can be converted to fashion 2 and 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.320
 fashion 4 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.980
 this is done as follows stifle 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.160
 button and turn on note 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 now fashion 2 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 how to turn off hold down turn on 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.920
 note fashion 4 treatment is simple 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.820
 leaves the same module translated 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.999
 total mod 2 during the flight is pressed to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 translation of the mod does not lead during 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:45.859
 flight can use inclusion 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.079
 Quadcopter cameras here include 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:52.379
 solitary photo and inclusion and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.140
 turn off the backlight but there is 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.140
 another button for flips 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.340
 transmitter equipped enough 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.920
 as you can see now with an interesting scheme 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.880
 rotten 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 gas on the left side now we 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 switch and fgos obtained from the right 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 the sides here are centered there is still 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:30.290
 neutral time 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.290
 need to catch it to that no 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:49.590
 it turns out not spring-loaded that one 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:53.700
 that 2 caught the neutral position in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.850
 which you can safely put 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.190
 the required gas level is slightly higher 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.490
 the average when the quadcopter will fly 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.490
 set flight exactly 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.500
 forward for example and after that just 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.030
 reject but need it not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.490
 be distracted by what is always needed 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.160
 crush forward like this 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:20.150
 interesting approach to the layout of this 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.150
 transmitter
