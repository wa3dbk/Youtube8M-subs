00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
really easy to get on I mean it's not

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.220 
the other one off a gallery of wigs and
gallery<00:02:46.520> wigs<00:02:46.940> actually<00:02:47.540> shipped<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.990> little

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
gallery wigs actually shipped a little

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.290 
gallery wigs actually shipped a little
sooner<00:02:48.590> than<00:02:48.770> name-brand<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.580> mean<00:02:49.910> that's<00:02:50.090> my

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
sooner than name-brand I mean that's my

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.400 
sooner than name-brand I mean that's my
only<00:02:50.690> complaint<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:52.450> name<00:02:53.450> brand<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.050> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
only complaint with name brand is that I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.870 
only complaint with name brand is that I
think<00:02:54.740> they<00:02:54.860> have<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.130> contact<00:02:55.370> their

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
think they have to contact their

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.480 
think they have to contact their
distributor<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.840> see<00:02:57.830> if<00:02:57.950> they<00:02:58.070> have<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.280> in

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
distributor and see if they have it in

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.310 
distributor and see if they have it in
stock<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:59.090> wait<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.720> come<00:02:59.960> in<00:03:00.110> and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
stock and wait for it to come in and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.170 
stock and wait for it to come in and
then<00:03:00.410> they<00:03:00.530> ship<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.950> I'm<00:03:01.130> not<00:03:01.340> positive<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.000> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
then they ship it I'm not positive but I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.060 
then they ship it I'm not positive but I
think<00:03:02.240> that's<00:03:02.870> how<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.650> goes<00:03:04.330> but<00:03:05.330> um<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.830> this

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
think that's how it goes but um so this

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.920 
think that's how it goes but um so this
is<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.370> top<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.970> then<00:03:08.210> this<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.570> how<00:03:08.720> much

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
is the top and then this is how much

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.910 
is the top and then this is how much
side<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.280> off<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.870> top<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.320> a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
side you get off of the top and a

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.370 
side you get off of the top and a
traditional<00:03:13.550> top<00:03:13.850> piece<00:03:14.180> like<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.020> lamode

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
traditional top piece like the lamode

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.560 
traditional top piece like the lamode
well<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.310> isn't<00:03:16.580> really<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.850> traditional<00:03:17.450> one

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
well this isn't really a traditional one

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.380 
well this isn't really a traditional one
oh<00:03:17.810> no<00:03:18.140> this<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.470> my<00:03:18.500> yeah<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.370> lamode<00:03:19.700> but

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
oh no this is my yeah this is lamode but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.990 
oh no this is my yeah this is lamode but
traditionally<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.530> top<00:03:21.740> piece<00:03:22.040> just<00:03:22.400> has<00:03:22.640> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
traditionally the top piece just has the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.480 
traditionally the top piece just has the
center<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.590> doesn't<00:03:24.890> come<00:03:25.040> down<00:03:25.070> on<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
center and it doesn't come down on the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.490 
center and it doesn't come down on the
sides<00:03:25.700> except<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.510> lamode<00:03:26.870> has<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.290> long

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
sides except the lamode has the long

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.360 
sides except the lamode has the long
pieces<00:03:27.880> here<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.450> that's<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.780> typical<00:03:30.370> top

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
pieces here but that's a typical top

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.230 
pieces here but that's a typical top
piece<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:33.410> this<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:34.760> wiglet

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
piece and then this is like a wiglet

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.530 
piece and then this is like a wiglet
almost<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.530> isn't<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:37.010> full<00:03:37.250> wig<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.790> it's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
almost so it isn't a full wig and it's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.810 
almost so it isn't a full wig and it's
more<00:03:38.840> than<00:03:39.020> a<00:03:39.080> topper<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.830> it's<00:03:40.400> very

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
more than a topper and it's very

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.800 
more than a topper and it's very
comfortable<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:42.190> I'll<00:03:43.190> take<00:03:43.490> it<00:03:43.640> off<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.330> the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
comfortable and I'll take it off so the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.280 
comfortable and I'll take it off so the
clips<00:03:45.110> on<00:03:45.320> me<00:03:45.590> sit<00:03:46.250> back<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.940> little<00:03:47.030> farther

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.960 

he's<00:03:51.290> fine<00:03:51.560> he<00:03:51.860> just<00:03:52.100> wants<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.460> get<00:03:52.820> across

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
he's fine he just wants to get across

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.030 
he's fine he just wants to get across
the<00:03:53.420> gate<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.810> other<00:03:53.930> dog<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.530> terrorize

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
the gate to the other dog to terrorize

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.580 
the gate to the other dog to terrorize
him<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.110> undo<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.990> clips<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
him so I just undo the the clips and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.120 
him so I just undo the the clips and
there's<00:04:00.770> my<00:04:00.950> hair<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.800> know<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:03.980> don't

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
there's my hair and you know I don't

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.350 
there's my hair and you know I don't
have<00:04:04.430> much<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:06.940> that's<00:04:07.940> what<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.209> looks

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
have much of it so that's what it looks

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.420 
have much of it so that's what it looks
like<00:04:08.510> without<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.010> inside<00:04:10.370> of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
like without and this is the inside of

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.860 
like without and this is the inside of
this<00:04:11.060> one<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.510> has<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.870> light-colored<00:04:12.620> cap

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
this one it has the light-colored cap

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.449 
this one it has the light-colored cap
because<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.260> doesn't<00:04:15.560> have<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.830> roots<00:04:16.070> and

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
because it doesn't have the roots and

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.820 
because it doesn't have the roots and
then<00:04:16.580> this<00:04:16.760> is<00:04:16.940> how<00:04:17.060> much<00:04:17.239> side<00:04:17.720> there<00:04:18.260> is<00:04:18.290> off

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
then this is how much side there is off

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.690 
then this is how much side there is off
of<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.190> top<00:04:19.850> piece<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:21.020> back<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.400> like<00:04:22.550> I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
of the top piece in the back so like I

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.790 
of the top piece in the back so like I
say<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.000> isn't<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.330> full<00:04:23.570> wig<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:24.110> call<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.680> a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
say it isn't a full wig I call it a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.750 
say it isn't a full wig I call it a
wiglet

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
wiglet

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.110 
wiglet
oh<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:25.940> don't<00:04:26.150> know<00:04:26.390> what<00:04:26.600> Noriko<00:04:27.080> calls<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.560> but

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
that's what I call it and then this one

both<00:05:06.650> synthetic<00:05:07.660> hair<00:05:08.660> which<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:08.960> definitely

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
both synthetic hair which is definitely

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.370 
both synthetic hair which is definitely
my<00:05:09.800> preference<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:11.150> then<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.420> back<00:05:11.600> one<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:11.900> go

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
my preference and then the back one I go

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.260 
my preference and then the back one I go
ahead<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.650> open<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.340> sometimes<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:13.940> use<00:05:13.970> that

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
ahead and open and sometimes I use that

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.170 
ahead and open and sometimes I use that
pull<00:05:14.480> tab<00:05:14.720> but<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:14.990> don't<00:05:15.200> really<00:05:15.590> need<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> I

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
pull tab but I don't really need to I

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.600 
pull tab but I don't really need to I
mean<00:05:17.360> it's<00:05:17.750> it's<00:05:18.440> easy<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.920> pull<00:05:19.100> down<00:05:19.310> just

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
mean it's it's easy to pull down just

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.160 
mean it's it's easy to pull down just
with<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.940> edge<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:22.220> wiglet<00:05:22.640> or<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
with the edge of the the wiglet or the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.440 
with the edge of the the wiglet or the
comb<00:05:24.170> and<00:05:24.470> then<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.460> blends<00:05:25.790> in<00:05:26.000> really<00:05:26.030> well

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
comb and then it blends in really well

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.120 
comb and then it blends in really well
with<00:05:26.480> my<00:05:26.750> hair<00:05:26.960> now<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.410> think<00:05:27.500> I'm<00:05:27.710> gonna<00:05:27.830> do<00:05:28.100> a
