about<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.660> cost<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.259> dental<00:00:07.620> implants

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
about what the cost of dental implants

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.730 
about what the cost of dental implants
are<00:00:08.400> that's<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.420> great<00:00:09.660> question<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.469> it's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
are that's a great question and it's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.890 
are that's a great question and it's
sort<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.070> like<00:00:11.130> saying<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:12.120> much<00:00:12.269> does<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> car

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
sort of like saying how much does a car

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.340 
sort of like saying how much does a car
cost<00:00:13.230> okay<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> all<00:00:14.940> depends<00:00:15.389> once<00:00:16.020> again

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
cost okay so it all depends once again

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.040 
cost okay so it all depends once again
depends<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:16.980> how<00:00:17.400> many<00:00:17.699> implants<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.690> what

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
depends on how many implants and what

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.160 
depends on how many implants and what
the<00:00:19.230> purpose<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> implants<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:21.170> just

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the purpose of the implants are just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.029 
the purpose of the implants are just
take<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:22.470> example<00:00:22.970> some<00:00:23.970> people<00:00:24.000> will<00:00:24.510> have

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
take an example some people will have

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
take an example some people will have
implants<00:00:26.039> used<00:00:26.369> which<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.730> basically<00:00:27.320> root

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
implants used which are basically root

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.070 
implants used which are basically root
replacements<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.400> go<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.539> help

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
replacements that go down in and help

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.549 
replacements that go down in and help
hold<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.830> support<00:00:32.309> teeth<00:00:32.700> okay<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
hold or support teeth okay so the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
hold or support teeth okay so the
simplest<00:00:35.070> type<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.750> implants<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> go

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
simplest type would be implants that go

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.940 
simplest type would be implants that go
down<00:00:37.320> into<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.610> jaw<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.180> support<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> denture

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
down into the jaw and support a denture

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.520 
down into the jaw and support a denture
okay<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> gives<00:00:42.329> us<00:00:42.450> some<00:00:42.690> support<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
okay it gives us some support and you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
okay it gives us some support and you
can<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.160> implants<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.390> may<00:00:45.539> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
can have two implants and you may be

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
materials etc you may look be looking at

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.990 
materials etc you may look be looking at
more<00:01:23.700> closer<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.830> 3,500<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> 4,000<00:01:26.700> dollars

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
more closer to 3,500 to 4,000 dollars

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
more closer to 3,500 to 4,000 dollars
for<00:01:27.570> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
for that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.830 
for that
implant<00:01:28.650> okay<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.060> depends<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.630> what

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
implant okay so it all depends on what

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.810 
implant okay so it all depends on what
you're<00:01:31.020> trying<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.380> accomplish<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:32.340> course<00:01:32.640> if

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you're trying to accomplish of course if

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.789 
you're trying to accomplish of course if
you<00:01:32.939> had<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> whole<00:01:33.360> mouthful<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> implants

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you had a whole mouthful of implants

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
you had a whole mouthful of implants
trying<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> replace<00:01:35.400> multiple<00:01:36.000> teeth<00:01:36.270> you're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
trying to replace multiple teeth you're

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380 
trying to replace multiple teeth you're
into<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.680> money<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.390> basically

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
into much more money and so basically

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.859 
into much more money and so basically
like<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.079> said<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.799> much<00:01:40.950> does<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> car<00:01:41.520> cost

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
like I said how much does a car cost

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.969 
like I said how much does a car cost
sometimes<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> look<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.380> restoring<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
sometimes if you look at restoring the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.520 
sometimes if you look at restoring the
whole<00:01:44.159> mouth<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> payment<00:01:46.229> for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
whole mouth you're into the payment for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
whole mouth you're into the payment for
a<00:01:46.560> car<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.579> good<00:01:47.850> thing<00:01:47.880> about<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.570> is
