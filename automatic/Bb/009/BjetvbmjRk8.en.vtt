to<00:01:34.500> earn<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> camera<00:01:35.040> coin<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:36.180> 10

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to earn a camera coin you need to get 10

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.780 
to earn a camera coin you need to get 10
Intel<00:01:37.020> assists<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.680> enemies<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.520> killed

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
Intel assists on enemies that are killed

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
Intel assists on enemies that are killed
while<00:01:38.970> spotted<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.720> camera<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.350> think

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
while spotted with your camera I think

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170 
while spotted with your camera I think
the<00:01:40.740> most<00:01:40.890> challenging<00:01:41.340> part<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the most challenging part on this is you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
the most challenging part on this is you
can't<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.659> tell<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.350> distance<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.159> radius

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
can't really tell the distance or radius

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
can't really tell the distance or radius
on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> cameras<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.600> kind<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> gotta

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on the cameras you just kind of gotta

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
on the cameras you just kind of gotta
place<00:01:46.409> them<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.799> hope<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> best

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
place them and hope for the best

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.429 
place them and hope for the best
I<00:01:47.970> found<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.390> easiest<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.840> Blood<00:01:49.049> Money<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I found this easiest on Blood Money just

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.899 
I found this easiest on Blood Money just
because<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> objective<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> center

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
because the objective is in the center

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.969 
because the objective is in the center
of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> map<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.420> very<00:01:51.659> high<00:01:51.899> traffic<00:01:52.170> area<00:01:52.710> on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
of the map a very high traffic area on

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
of the map a very high traffic area on
any<00:01:53.399> map<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.659> kind<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
any map really so you can just kind of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.480 
any map really so you can just kind of
place<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.409> cameras<00:01:55.860> around<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> objective

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
place these cameras around the objective

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
place these cameras around the objective
don't<00:01:56.969> play<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.329> too<00:01:57.509> close<00:01:57.780> though<00:01:58.020> because

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
don't play some too close though because

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.749 
don't play some too close though because
if<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> enemies<00:01:58.829> start<00:01:58.950> needing<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> they

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
if the enemies start needing it they

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
if the enemies start needing it they
will<00:01:59.969> blow<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.270> camera<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.810> however<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
will blow your camera up however if the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
will blow your camera up however if the
camera<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.740> placed<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.159> little<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.549> away<00:02:02.850> from

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
camera is placed a little bit away from

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
camera is placed a little bit away from
the<00:02:03.090> objective<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.049> more<00:02:04.320> likely<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the objective it is more likely that it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.190 
the objective it is more likely that it
will<00:02:04.920> survive<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.610> nade

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
will survive the nade

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.899 
will survive the nade
and<00:02:06.439> each<00:02:06.740> time<00:02:06.979> an<00:02:07.130> enemy<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.460> killed<00:02:07.670> by<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
and each time an enemy is killed by a

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.699 
and each time an enemy is killed by a
teammate<00:02:08.360> Ross<00:02:08.630> spotted<00:02:09.050> by<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:09.289> camera<00:02:09.619> you

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
teammate Ross spotted by your camera you

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.160 
teammate Ross spotted by your camera you
get<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.429> Intel<00:02:10.880> assist<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.390> again<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.050> need

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
get one Intel assist and again you need

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.339 
get one Intel assist and again you need
ten<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.800> these<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.310> order<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.330> one<00:02:14.599> coin<00:02:14.930> so

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
ten of these in order to get one coin so

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.589 
ten of these in order to get one coin so
my<00:02:15.470> best<00:02:15.739> advice<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.400> on<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.300> just

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
my best advice to you on this is to just

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.360 
my best advice to you on this is to just
kind<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.900> place<00:02:18.530> these<00:02:18.709> cameras<00:02:19.099> around<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
kind of place these cameras around the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.309 
kind of place these cameras around the
objective<00:02:19.849> and<00:02:20.090> sit<00:02:20.420> back<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.660> little<00:02:20.900> bit<00:02:21.080> so

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
objective and sit back a little bit so

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.170 
objective and sit back a little bit so
your<00:02:21.709> teammates<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:22.099> spawn<00:02:22.520> on<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.030> then

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
your teammates can spawn on you and then

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.390 
your teammates can spawn on you and then
they<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.510> run<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:24.290> those<00:02:24.440> kills<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.069> load

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
they can run in get those kills and load

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490 
they can run in get those kills and load
you<00:02:25.550> up<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:25.730> Intel<00:02:26.150> assists<00:02:26.569> hopefully<00:02:27.110> also

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
you up with Intel assists hopefully also

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.229 
you up with Intel assists hopefully also
you<00:02:27.739> want<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> keep<00:02:28.100> up<00:02:28.280> where<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.640> action<00:02:29.120> is

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
you want to keep up where the action is

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.880 
you want to keep up where the action is
in<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.600> game<00:02:29.810> because<00:02:30.230> after<00:02:30.650> about<00:02:30.830> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
in the game because after about the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.979 
in the game because after about the
halfway<00:02:31.220> point<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.819> Blood<00:02:32.060> Money<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.480> enemy

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
halfway point on Blood Money the enemy

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.020 
halfway point on Blood Money the enemy
will<00:02:33.170> generally<00:02:33.680> tend<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.040> try<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.670> attack

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
will generally tend to try and attack

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.000 
will generally tend to try and attack
your<00:02:35.209> vault<00:02:35.510> or<00:02:35.750> defend<00:02:36.260> theirs<00:02:36.470> depending<00:02:36.920> on

your vault or defend theirs depending on

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.530 
your vault or defend theirs depending on
what<00:02:37.099> your<00:02:37.250> team<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.580> doing<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.209> given<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
what your team is doing so given the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.580 
what your team is doing so given the
fact<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.019> have<00:02:39.140> up<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.440> three

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
fact that you can have up to three

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.979 
fact that you can have up to three
cameras<00:02:40.190> placed<00:02:40.400> at<00:02:40.670> once<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> found<00:02:41.690> very

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
cameras placed at once what I found very

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.559 
cameras placed at once what I found very
helpful<00:02:42.170> was<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:43.160> either<00:02:43.340> place<00:02:43.760> mine<00:02:44.000> at<00:02:44.299> the

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
helpful was to either place mine at the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.199 
helpful was to either place mine at the
enemy<00:02:44.930> vault<00:02:45.140> or<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.860> my<00:02:46.250> team's<00:02:46.549> vault<00:02:46.880> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
enemy vault or at my team's vault that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.850 
enemy vault or at my team's vault that
way<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.750> cameras<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.290> both<00:02:48.319> high

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
way you have cameras at both high

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.949 
way you have cameras at both high
traffic<00:02:49.190> locations<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.209> really<00:02:50.600> giving<00:02:50.870> you

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
traffic locations and really giving you

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.050 
traffic locations and really giving you
a<00:02:50.989> better<00:02:51.290> chance<00:02:51.350> at<00:02:51.950> getting<00:02:52.069> those<00:02:52.670> Intel

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
a better chance at getting those Intel

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.759 
a better chance at getting those Intel
assists<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.989> need<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.500> camera

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
assists that you need for the camera

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.009 
assists that you need for the camera
points<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.580> again<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.209> mainly<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.630> luck

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
points but again it's mainly just luck

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.360 
points but again it's mainly just luck
you<00:02:57.200> just<00:02:57.230> kind<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.590> gotta<00:02:57.709> hope<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.250> and

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you just kind of gotta hope for it and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.309 
you just kind of gotta hope for it and
it<00:02:58.549> took<00:02:58.670> me<00:02:58.819> a<00:02:58.850> really<00:02:59.000> long<00:02:59.390> time<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.870> get<00:03:00.019> one

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
it took me a really long time to get one

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.440 
it took me a really long time to get one
but<00:03:00.769> once<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.130> got<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.459> one<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:01.940> got<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> feel

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
but once I got the one and got a feel

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.570 
but once I got the one and got a feel
for<00:03:02.690> where<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> place<00:03:03.530> those<00:03:03.709> cameras<00:03:04.250> it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
for where to place those cameras it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.920 
for where to place those cameras it
really<00:03:04.790> only<00:03:04.850> took<00:03:05.060> me<00:03:05.209> about<00:03:05.239> four<00:03:05.630> games

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
really only took me about four games

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.660 
really only took me about four games
after<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.100> not<00:03:07.190> too<00:03:07.430> bad<00:03:07.640> just

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
after that so it's not too bad just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.920 
after that so it's not too bad just
takes<00:03:08.060> some<00:03:08.209> getting<00:03:08.450> used<00:03:08.600> to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
takes some getting used to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.850 
takes some getting used to
with<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.200> once<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.680> completed
