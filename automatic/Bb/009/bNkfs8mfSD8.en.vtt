then trying to do the warmers and my ECB

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.190 
then trying to do the warmers and my ECB
didn't<00:00:35.130> print<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> had<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> return<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
didn't print so I had to return the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040 
didn't print so I had to return the
rumors<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.520> pick<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.210> two<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
rumors and then pick up two more of the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.340 
rumors and then pick up two more of the
things<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.379> did<00:00:40.649> qualify<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.840> wanted<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
things that did qualify if you wanted to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
things that did qualify if you wanted to
fight<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.160> could<00:00:44.820> probably<00:00:45.120> fight<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
fight it you could probably fight it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.790 
fight it you could probably fight it
because<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.230> does<00:00:46.410> say<00:00:46.620> any<00:00:46.860> febreze<00:00:47.539> but<00:00:48.800> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
because it does say any febreze but it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.630

wasn't<00:00:50.129> included<00:00:51.410> actually<00:00:52.410> printing<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.920> so
