00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.280 
give some coverage so I like to just don
don<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> dot<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.479> face<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.990> not

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
don and dot it all over my face I'm not

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.609 
don and dot it all over my face I'm not
even<00:01:41.100> 100%<00:01:41.159> sure<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
even 100% sure if this is the right

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.240 
even 100% sure if this is the right
color<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.649> only<00:01:47.280> had<00:01:49.250> two

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
color but they really only had two

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.149 
color but they really only had two
colors<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:53.600> they<00:01:54.600> had<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.950> light<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:58.159> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
colors so they had this light one and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.529 
colors so they had this light one and
then<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.000> had<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.600> medium<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.829> well

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.670 

so<00:02:08.539> it's<00:02:08.660> blending<00:02:09.020> in<00:02:09.140> quite<00:02:09.440> nicely<00:02:09.709> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
so it's blending in quite nicely I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.850 
so it's blending in quite nicely I
didn't<00:02:12.680> put<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.190> primer<00:02:13.760> because<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:15.290> primer<00:02:15.650> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
didn't put a primer because the primer I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.690 
didn't put a primer because the primer I
use<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.989> normally<00:02:17.989> mattifying<00:02:18.500> anyway<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.670> I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
use is normally mattifying anyway so I

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.470 
use is normally mattifying anyway so I
didn't<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.330> affect<00:02:22.239> how<00:02:23.239> this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
didn't want that to affect how this

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.229 
didn't want that to affect how this
works

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.540 

alrighty<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.569> there<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.560> BB<00:02:34.069> cream<00:02:34.340> I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
alrighty so there is the BB cream I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.100 
alrighty so there is the BB cream I
really<00:02:34.910> only<00:02:35.090> ever<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.630> one<00:02:37.450> layer<00:02:41.019> because<00:02:42.019> I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
really only ever do one layer because I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.440 
really only ever do one layer because I
don't<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.410> have<00:02:42.700> too<00:02:43.700> many<00:02:43.819> things<00:02:44.150> wrong

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
don't really have too many things wrong

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.900 
don't really have too many things wrong
with<00:02:44.569> my<00:02:44.720> skin<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.290> don't<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.099> for<00:02:46.819> me

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
so good on the madness I noticed that

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.039 
so good on the madness I noticed that
even<00:04:01.609> when<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:01.940> just<00:04:02.329> had<00:04:02.480> this<00:04:02.630> on<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.959> was

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
even when I just had this on it was

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.280 
even when I just had this on it was
quite<00:04:03.290> matte<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:03.709> my<00:04:03.829> face<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:05.239> it<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.569> light

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
quite matte on my face and it is light

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.089 
quite matte on my face and it is light
enough<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:06.769> did<00:04:08.170> blend<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.290> little<00:04:09.590> bit<00:04:09.739> easier

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
enough it did blend a little bit easier

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.830 
enough it did blend a little bit easier
into<00:04:10.400> my<00:04:10.519> skin<00:04:10.849> there<00:04:11.030> was<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> little<00:04:11.540> bit<00:04:11.690> of

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
into my skin there was a little bit of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.960 
into my skin there was a little bit of
coloration<00:04:12.709> on<00:04:13.009> the<00:04:13.130> neck<00:04:13.310> though<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:13.820> had

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
coloration on the neck though so I had

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.110 
coloration on the neck though so I had
to<00:04:14.060> blend<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.389> down<00:04:14.570> but<00:04:15.259> other<00:04:15.410> than<00:04:15.590> that

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
to blend it down but other than that

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.060 
to blend it down but other than that
really<00:04:16.359> good<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.840> think<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.440> might

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
really good so I think that this might

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.060 
really good so I think that this might
