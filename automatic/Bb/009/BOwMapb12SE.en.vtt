like this if you've got an amp or

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.020 
like this if you've got an amp or
another<00:00:09.920> audio<00:00:10.220> device<00:00:12.610> okay<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:13.670> we<00:00:13.880> have<00:00:13.970> a

another audio device okay so we have a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.410 
another audio device okay so we have a
cold<00:00:14.630> solder<00:00:14.930> in<00:00:15.170> there<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:16.119> I've<00:00:17.119> never

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
cold solder in there and I've never

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.630 
cold solder in there and I've never
owned<00:00:17.660> an<00:00:17.869> amp<00:00:18.140> that<00:00:18.410> hasn't<00:00:18.710> developed<00:00:19.280> this

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
owned an amp that hasn't developed this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.220 
owned an amp that hasn't developed this
one<00:00:20.150> thing<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.390> have<00:00:20.570> done<00:00:20.810> though<00:00:20.990> is<00:00:21.020> I've

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
one thing I have done though is I've

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.840 
one thing I have done though is I've
started<00:00:21.440> going<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.100> right<00:00:22.280> angle<00:00:22.490> Jack

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
started going to the right angle Jack

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.980 
started going to the right angle Jack
out<00:00:23.210> of<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.630> amp<00:00:23.780> which<00:00:24.680> helps<00:00:25.750> relieve<00:00:26.750> some

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
out of the amp which helps relieve some

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.150 
out of the amp which helps relieve some
tension<00:00:27.020> because<00:00:27.680> there's<00:00:27.830> not<00:00:27.949> as<00:00:28.039> much

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
tension because there's not as much

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.040 
tension because there's not as much
weight<00:00:28.430> coming<00:00:28.730> straight<00:00:29.000> out<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:29.720> also

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
weight coming straight out and it also

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.770 
weight coming straight out and it also
hopefully<00:00:31.010> will<00:00:31.160> help<00:00:31.369> you<00:00:32.300> know<00:00:32.390> prevent

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
going to unplug the reverb pan now you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.170 
going to unplug the reverb pan now you
know<00:00:47.300> all<00:00:47.570> amps<00:00:48.290> are<00:00:48.410> basically<00:00:49.180> similar

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
know all amps are basically similar

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.209 
know all amps are basically similar
they're<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:50.540> exactly<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.110> same<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.680> you'll

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
they're not exactly the same so you'll

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.700 
they're not exactly the same so you'll
have<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.520> go<00:00:52.610> through<00:00:52.880> your<00:00:53.079> amp<00:00:54.079> itself<00:00:54.469> and

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
have to go through your amp itself and

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.049 
have to go through your amp itself and
see<00:00:54.770> what<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.980> need<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.190> unplug<00:00:55.280> obviously

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
see what you need to unplug obviously

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.660 
see what you need to unplug obviously

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the speaker if you have reverb so I'm

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.069 
the speaker if you have reverb so I'm
going<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:58.850> unplug<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.420> speaker<00:00:59.719> here<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.020> I'm

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
going to unplug the speaker here and I'm

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.149 
going to unplug the speaker here and I'm
going<00:01:00.200> to<00:01:00.230> remember<00:01:00.500> which<00:01:02.170> which<00:01:03.170> color<00:01:03.950> wire

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
going to remember which which color wire

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.149 
going to remember which which color wire
goes<00:01:04.369> on<00:01:04.549> which<00:01:05.469> speaker<00:01:06.469> terminal<00:01:06.829> so<00:01:06.920> we<00:01:07.010> can

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
goes on which speaker terminal so we can

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.310 
goes on which speaker terminal so we can
maintain<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.760> correct<00:01:08.000> polarity<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.110> mine

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
maintain the correct polarity so on mine

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.670 
maintain the correct polarity so on mine
the<00:01:09.350> blue<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.430> right<00:01:10.640> okay<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.750> that's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the blue is on the right okay and that's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.149 
the blue is on the right okay and that's
it<00:01:12.860> now<00:01:13.159> I'm<00:01:13.610> just<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.920> go<00:01:15.920> ahead<00:01:15.979> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
it now I'm just going to go ahead and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.149 
it now I'm just going to go ahead and
remove<00:01:16.400> these<00:01:16.610> Phillips<00:01:17.090> screws<00:01:17.390> here<00:01:18.159> which

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
remove these Phillips screws here which

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.370 
remove these Phillips screws here which
again<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.090> know<00:01:20.210> your<00:01:20.390> amp<00:01:20.600> may<00:01:20.900> be<00:01:20.960> slightly

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
again you know your amp may be slightly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.149 
again you know your amp may be slightly
different<00:01:21.710> or<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:24.350> could<00:01:24.530> be<00:01:24.680> very<00:01:24.830> similar

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
different or it could be very similar

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.429 
different or it could be very similar
okay<00:01:26.090> now<00:01:26.869> I'm<00:01:26.930> just<00:01:26.960> going<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.229> leave<00:01:27.320> these

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
okay now I'm just going to leave these

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.080 
okay now I'm just going to leave these
back<00:01:27.710> ones<00:01:27.979> in<00:01:28.159> a<00:01:28.430> little<00:01:28.640> bit<00:01:30.850> okay<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
back ones in a little bit okay and the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.520 
back ones in a little bit okay and the
reason<00:01:32.240> why<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:32.840> want<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.049> get<00:01:33.140> these<00:01:33.229> front

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
reason why is I want to get these front

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.020 
reason why is I want to get these front
ones<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.830> first<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.369> front<00:01:34.549> is<00:01:34.790> sort<00:01:34.970> of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
ones out first the front is sort of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.260 
ones out first the front is sort of
supported<00:01:35.659> by<00:01:36.430> being<00:01:37.430> tucked<00:01:37.640> into<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.030> front

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
supported by being tucked into the front

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.510 
supported by being tucked into the front
of<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.750> grill<00:01:39.290> there<00:01:39.619> between<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.159> grill<00:01:40.400> and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of the grill there between the grill and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.310 
of the grill there between the grill and
the<00:01:40.610> cabinet<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.659> we<00:01:41.780> can<00:01:41.900> pull<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.170> front

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
the cabinet so we can pull the front

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.640 
the cabinet so we can pull the front
ones<00:01:43.630> but<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.810> pull<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> back<00:01:45.290> ones<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
ones but if you pull the back ones the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.260 
ones but if you pull the back ones the
back<00:01:45.829> will<00:01:46.040> drop<00:01:46.340> kind<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:46.909> I'm<00:01:46.970> just<00:01:47.119> going

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
back will drop kind of so I'm just going

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.200 
back will drop kind of so I'm just going
to<00:01:47.920> support<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.040> with<00:01:49.070> my<00:01:49.280> hand<00:01:49.640> when<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:49.880> remove

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
to support it with my hand when I remove

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:58.820 
to support it with my hand when I remove
those<00:01:50.479> screws

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.230 

you<00:01:59.830> saw<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.190> one<00:02:00.340> come<00:02:00.580> up<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:00.970> can<00:02:01.090> see

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
you saw that one come up so you can see

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.650 
you saw that one come up so you can see
that<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.570> back<00:02:02.050> of<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.320> amps<00:02:02.590> already

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
that the back of the amps already

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:15.120 
that the back of the amps already
dropping<00:02:04.660> down<00:02:13.350> hey<00:02:14.350> what<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.710> can<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.070> you

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
dropping down hey what you can do is you

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.350 
dropping down hey what you can do is you
can<00:02:15.250> kind<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.460> give<00:02:15.610> some<00:02:15.640> pressure<00:02:16.000> from<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
can kind of give some pressure from the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.560 
can kind of give some pressure from the
front<00:02:16.600> try<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> wiggle<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:21.300> that's<00:02:22.300> it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
front try to wiggle it out that's it

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.080 
front try to wiggle it out that's it
alright<00:02:23.380> Lee<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.680> get<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> cabin<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
alright Lee I get the cabin out of the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.750 
alright Lee I get the cabin out of the
way<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.360> speaker<00:02:29.130> alright<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.490> this

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
way of the speaker alright so this

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.320 
way of the speaker alright so this
particular<00:02:31.450> jack<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:33.340> not<00:02:33.400> exhibiting<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
particular jack is not exhibiting the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.850 
particular jack is not exhibiting the
same<00:02:34.510> problem<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.020> was<00:02:35.200> expecting<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
same problem that I was expecting you to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.440 
same problem that I was expecting you to
have<00:02:36.280> as<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.670> matter<00:02:36.910> of<00:02:36.970> fact<00:02:37.150> someone's

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
have as a matter of fact someone's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.020 
have as a matter of fact someone's
already<00:02:37.600> been<00:02:37.690> at<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.230> inputs<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.070> hot<00:02:39.700> glue

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
already been at it in inputs a hot glue

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.610 
already been at it in inputs a hot glue
underneath<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:42.270> solder<00:02:43.270> position<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.350> in

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
underneath the solder position so in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.050 
underneath the solder position so in
this<00:02:44.740> case<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.460> I've<00:02:45.580> got<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> mounted

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
this case that I've got it mounted

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.370 
this case that I've got it mounted
backwards<00:02:46.390> obviously<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.080> I've<00:02:47.140> got<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
backwards obviously and I've got the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.960 
backwards obviously and I've got the
speaker<00:02:47.650> plugged<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.010> in<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.250> case<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.730> jack

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
speaker plugged in in this case the jack

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.330 
speaker plugged in in this case the jack
itself<00:02:49.150> had<00:02:49.480> lost<00:02:49.720> some<00:02:49.930> spring<00:02:50.200> tension<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.310> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
itself had lost some spring tension so I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
itself had lost some spring tension so I
don't<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.060> wiggle<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.420> around<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.750> you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
don't know as I wiggle it around if you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.640 
don't know as I wiggle it around if you
can<00:02:52.990> see<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:54.450> spring<00:02:55.450> move<00:02:56.140> up<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.440> down<00:02:56.590> or

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
can see that spring move up and down or

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.800 
can see that spring move up and down or
not<00:02:57.010> so<00:02:57.190> all's<00:02:57.430> I've<00:02:57.700> done<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.240> normally

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
not so all's I've done here normally

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.510 
not so all's I've done here normally
what<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> would<00:02:59.739> do<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.980> take<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.310> hole

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
what I would do is take this hole

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.670 
what I would do is take this hole
printed<00:03:01.120> circuit<00:03:01.450> board<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.650> I

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
printed circuit board out and then I

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.460 
printed circuit board out and then I
would<00:03:02.920> actually<00:03:03.239> resolder<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.750> pins<00:03:05.080> as<00:03:05.320> they

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
would actually resolder the pins as they

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.280 
would actually resolder the pins as they
come<00:03:05.709> through<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.040> board<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.660> case

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
come through the board but in this case

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.729 
come through the board but in this case
all's<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.680> really<00:03:08.980> needed<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.550> was<00:03:10.090> take<00:03:10.739> I'm

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
all's I really needed to do was take I'm

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.780 
all's I really needed to do was take I'm
not<00:03:11.860> gonna<00:03:12.040> do<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.250> right<00:03:12.280> now<00:03:12.400> because<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
not gonna do it right now because the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.360 
not gonna do it right now because the
the<00:03:13.090> amps<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.540> in<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.080> place<00:03:14.320> but<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.830> just<00:03:15.220> took

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
the amps on in the place but I just took

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.590 
the amps on in the place but I just took
a<00:03:15.430> needlenose<00:03:16.350> single<00:03:17.350> jaw<00:03:17.709> like<00:03:18.070> this<00:03:18.600> tapped

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
a needlenose single jaw like this tapped

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.500 
a needlenose single jaw like this tapped
on<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:19.959> with<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> hammer<00:03:20.850> slightly<00:03:21.850> without<00:03:22.300> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
on it with a hammer slightly without a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.570 
on it with a hammer slightly without a
jack<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:22.900> there<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.590> basically<00:03:23.800> rebuilt

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
jack in there and I basically rebuilt

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.670 
jack in there and I basically rebuilt
that<00:03:24.940> metal<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.020> it<00:03:26.110> would<00:03:26.230> apply<00:03:26.380> more

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
that metal so it would apply more

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.990 
that metal so it would apply more
tension<00:03:27.130> so

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.840 

it's<00:03:31.810> not<00:03:32.050> does<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.440> give<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.400> any<00:03:33.550> fits

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it's not does not give them any fits

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.870 
it's not does not give them any fits
right<00:03:34.060> now<00:03:34.240> so<00:03:34.540> I'm<00:03:34.660> not<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.440> actually

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
right now so I'm not going to actually

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.220 
right now so I'm not going to actually
remove<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.060> whole<00:03:37.210> PC<00:03:37.600> board<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:37.930> resolder

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
remove the whole PC board and resolder

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.320 
remove the whole PC board and resolder
it<00:03:38.530> because<00:03:38.860> someone's<00:03:39.610> already<00:03:39.760> been<00:03:39.880> added

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
it because someone's already been added

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.910 
it because someone's already been added
with<00:03:40.450> actually<00:03:40.840> what<00:03:40.990> looks<00:03:41.200> like<00:03:41.290> hot<00:03:41.590> glue

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
with actually what looks like hot glue

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.080 
with actually what looks like hot glue
so<00:03:42.190> they<00:03:42.280> must<00:03:42.460> had<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> problem<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
so they must had a problem with this

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.280 
so they must had a problem with this
before<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.600> let<00:03:43.720> me<00:03:43.780> show<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.170> did

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
before so let me show you what I did

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.140 
before so let me show you what I did
here<00:03:44.650> let<00:03:45.100> me<00:03:45.130> hold<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.520> amp<00:03:45.670> out<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.000> here

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
here let me hold the amp out of here

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.720 
here let me hold the amp out of here
real<00:03:46.330> quick<00:03:49.380> alright<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:50.770> what<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> found<00:03:51.280> with

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
real quick alright so what I found with

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.920 
real quick alright so what I found with
mine<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.360> as<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.870> move<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.230> jack<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.770> down<00:03:53.950> I

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
mine is as I move the jack up and down I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.380 
mine is as I move the jack up and down I
realized<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.470> top<00:03:56.860> spring<00:03:57.400> tension

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
realized that this top spring tension

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.430 
realized that this top spring tension
piece<00:03:58.960> that<00:03:59.680> goes<00:03:59.860> on<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.190> tip<00:04:00.990> on<00:04:01.990> this<00:04:02.170> tip

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
piece that goes on the tip on this tip

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.720 
piece that goes on the tip on this tip
sleeve<00:04:02.820> input<00:04:04.709> was<00:04:05.709> not<00:04:06.040> making<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.550> good

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
sleeve input was not making a good

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.030 
sleeve input was not making a good
connection<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.330> as<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.750> wiggled<00:04:08.170> basically

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
connection so as it wiggled basically

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.530 
connection so as it wiggled basically
there<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.340> times<00:04:09.580> when<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.880> wasn't<00:04:10.120> hitting

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
there was times when this wasn't hitting

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.110 
there was times when this wasn't hitting
so<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:12.040> that's<00:04:12.220> why<00:04:12.400> when<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> would<00:04:12.820> pull<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
so and that's why when I would pull the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.270 
so and that's why when I would pull the
jack<00:04:13.360> down<00:04:13.390> it<00:04:13.840> would<00:04:13.930> make<00:04:14.080> connection<00:04:14.530> okay

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
jack down it would make connection okay

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.740 
jack down it would make connection okay
so<00:04:15.340> what<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.580> ended<00:04:16.000> up<00:04:16.120> doing<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:16.690> is

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
so what I ended up doing and this is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.180 
so what I ended up doing and this is
probably<00:04:17.019> not<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:19.209> know<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.620> an<00:04:20.620> official

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
probably not a you know a an official

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.900 
probably not a you know a an official
approved<00:04:21.640> fix<00:04:22.510> but<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> 1984<00:04:24.640> amp

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
approved fix but this is like a 1984 amp

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.250 
approved fix but this is like a 1984 amp
I'm<00:04:25.090> not<00:04:25.210> going<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.419> put<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.930> whole<00:04:26.080> lot<00:04:26.110> of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
I'm not going to put a whole lot of

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.770 
I'm not going to put a whole lot of
money<00:04:26.410> into<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.890> only<00:04:27.040> use<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.280> occasionally

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
money into it I only use it occasionally

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.200 
money into it I only use it occasionally
I<00:04:29.070> just<00:04:30.070> took<00:04:30.480> needlenose<00:04:31.980> just<00:04:32.980> wind<00:04:33.940> it<00:04:34.090> out

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
I just took needlenose just wind it out

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.190 
I just took needlenose just wind it out
a<00:04:34.240> little<00:04:34.419> bit<00:04:34.660> let<00:04:35.590> me<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.860> took<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.070> jaw

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
a little bit let me just took the jaw

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.450 
a little bit let me just took the jaw
you<00:04:38.200> can<00:04:38.440> use<00:04:38.530> anything<00:04:38.770> that's<00:04:38.950> small<00:04:39.280> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
you can use anything that's small and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.920 
you can use anything that's small and
flat<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:39.940> I<00:04:39.970> just<00:04:40.150> kind<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.419> gave<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.750> couple

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
flat and I just kind of gave it a couple

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.659 
flat and I just kind of gave it a couple
of<00:04:41.169> gentle<00:04:41.620> love<00:04:42.460> taps<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.090> call<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:44.669> enough

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
of gentle love taps as I call it enough

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.080 
of gentle love taps as I call it enough
to<00:04:45.820> bend<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.180> down<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.720> little<00:04:47.380> bit<00:04:47.620> more<00:04:48.090> than

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
to bend it down a little bit more than

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.790 
to bend it down a little bit more than
what<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.419> was<00:04:49.600> okay<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.200> other<00:04:50.260> thing<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.620> did

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
what it was okay the other thing I did

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.840 
what it was okay the other thing I did
was<00:04:51.419> there's<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.510> little<00:04:52.840> law<00:04:53.760> there's<00:04:54.760> a

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
was there's a little law there's a

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.800 
was there's a little law there's a
little<00:04:55.150> metal<00:04:55.330> tab<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:57.580> actually<00:04:58.150> creates

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
little metal tab that actually creates

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.500 
little metal tab that actually creates
spring<00:04:59.169> tension<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.680> sits<00:04:59.919> into<00:05:00.220> this<00:05:00.520> groove

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
spring tension and sits into this groove

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.409 
spring tension and sits into this groove
on<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.930> tip<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.440> that's<00:05:03.100> what<00:05:03.460> gives<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.390> a

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
on the tip and that's what gives you a

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.270 
on the tip and that's what gives you a
little<00:05:04.570> bit<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.930> tension<00:05:05.680> when<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:06.010> pull<00:05:06.160> it

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
little bit of tension when you pull it

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.140 
little bit of tension when you pull it
out<00:05:06.370> as<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.490> matter<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:06.669> fact<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.880> can<00:05:07.030> see<00:05:07.120> I

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
out as a matter of fact you can see I

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.520 
out as a matter of fact you can see I
may<00:05:07.300> have<00:05:07.360> bent<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.750> little<00:05:07.900> too<00:05:08.080> much<00:05:08.260> I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
may have bent it a little too much I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.130 
may have bent it a little too much I
bent<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.310> down<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.700> little<00:05:09.970> bit<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:10.660> again

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
bent that down a little bit so again

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.630 
bent that down a little bit so again
with<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.440> needlenose<00:05:11.710> pliers<00:05:12.040> I<00:05:12.310> didn't<00:05:12.520> use

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
with the needlenose pliers I didn't use

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.700 
with the needlenose pliers I didn't use
the<00:05:12.820> hammer<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.600> took<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.960> pushed<00:05:14.590> down

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
the hammer I just took and pushed down

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.840 
the hammer I just took and pushed down
on<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.250> tab<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.360> now<00:05:16.950> this<00:05:17.950> top<00:05:18.310> piece<00:05:18.610> is

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
on that tab so now this top piece is

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.719 
on that tab so now this top piece is
providing<00:05:19.360> plenty<00:05:19.720> of<00:05:19.780> tension<00:05:19.990> on<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:21.490> tip

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
providing plenty of tension on the tip

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.320 
providing plenty of tension on the tip
of<00:05:21.910> quarter-inch<00:05:22.840> jack<00:05:23.350> so<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.790> was<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.090> fix

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
of quarter-inch jack so that was the fix

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.690 
of quarter-inch jack so that was the fix
on<00:05:25.510> this<00:05:25.630> particular<00:05:25.930> amp<00:05:26.380> I<00:05:26.680> was<00:05:27.400> fully

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
on this particular amp I was fully

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.110 
on this particular amp I was fully
expecting<00:05:28.450> that<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.750> was<00:05:28.870> going<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.140> be<00:05:30.120> and

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
expecting that it was going to be and

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.560 
expecting that it was going to be and
wind<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.750> out<00:05:31.870> here<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.940> legs<00:05:34.300> on<00:05:34.860> this<00:05:35.860> jack

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
wind it out here the legs on this jack

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.060 
wind it out here the legs on this jack
going<00:05:37.570> through<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.930> board<00:05:38.169> oftentimes

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
going through the board oftentimes

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.730 
going through the board oftentimes
basically<00:05:39.880> become<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.479> cold<00:05:40.840> solder<00:05:41.110> joint<00:05:41.470> and

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
basically become a cold solder joint and

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.520 
basically become a cold solder joint and
that's<00:05:42.310> from<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.580> vibration<00:05:43.150> as<00:05:43.330> well<00:05:43.510> as

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
that's from the vibration as well as

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.440 
that's from the vibration as well as
the<00:05:44.680> weight<00:05:44.890> of<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.460> jack<00:05:45.760> pulling<00:05:46.240> down<00:05:46.420> on

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
the weight of the jack pulling down on

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.000 
the weight of the jack pulling down on
it<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:46.930> vibrating<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.590> everything<00:05:47.890> else

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
it and vibrating and everything else

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.160 
it and vibrating and everything else
people<00:05:48.430> hitting<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.850> and<00:05:48.910> ripping<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.300> out<00:05:49.480> so

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
people hitting it and ripping it out so

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.560 
people hitting it and ripping it out so
what<00:05:50.320> ends<00:05:50.560> up<00:05:50.620> happening<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:51.250> on<00:05:52.180> the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
what ends up happening is on the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.570 
what ends up happening is on the
backside<00:05:53.080> of<00:05:53.140> this<00:05:53.290> piece<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.710> PC<00:05:54.190> board<00:05:54.430> so

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
backside of this piece of PC board so

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.100 
backside of this piece of PC board so
I'd<00:05:54.670> have<00:05:54.790> to<00:05:54.850> pull<00:05:55.450> all<00:05:55.510> these<00:05:55.630> knobs<00:05:55.810> and

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
I'd have to pull all these knobs and

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.690 
I'd have to pull all these knobs and
pull<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.350> PC<00:05:56.650> board<00:05:56.890> out

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
pull the PC board out

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.210 
pull the PC board out
you<00:05:58.090> basically<00:05:58.270> have<00:05:58.510> to<00:05:58.690> resolder<00:05:59.230> where

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
you basically have to resolder where

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.120 
you basically have to resolder where
those<00:06:00.460> pins<00:06:00.790> come<00:06:01.060> through<00:06:01.390> so<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.800> can<00:06:02.830> you

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
those pins come through so you can you

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.370 
those pins come through so you can you
even<00:06:03.340> utilize<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.880> solder<00:06:04.090> that's<00:06:04.270> there<00:06:04.630> but

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
even utilize the solder that's there but

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.020 
even utilize the solder that's there but
I<00:06:05.440> usually<00:06:05.740> add<00:06:05.890> a<00:06:05.920> little<00:06:06.160> bit<00:06:06.340> more<00:06:06.370> now<00:06:06.850> what

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
I usually add a little bit more now what

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.910 
I usually add a little bit more now what
somebody's<00:06:07.480> done<00:06:07.720> you<00:06:08.110> can<00:06:08.290> almost<00:06:08.470> see<00:06:08.830> it

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
somebody's done you can almost see it

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.640 
somebody's done you can almost see it
there<00:06:09.280> is<00:06:09.460> they<00:06:10.300> took<00:06:10.450> hot<00:06:10.690> glue<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.380> you'll

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
there is they took hot glue and you'll

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.710 
there is they took hot glue and you'll
see<00:06:11.830> how<00:06:11.950> it<00:06:12.010> glue<00:06:12.220> this<00:06:12.430> hot<00:06:12.670> glue<00:06:12.790> there<00:06:13.150> I'm

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
see how it glue this hot glue there I'm

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.590 
see how it glue this hot glue there I'm
assuming<00:06:14.200> this<00:06:14.350> is<00:06:14.530> all<00:06:15.480> from<00:06:16.480> the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
assuming this is all from the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.630 
assuming this is all from the
manufacturer<00:06:17.260> but<00:06:17.890> they<00:06:18.010> don't<00:06:18.190> always<00:06:18.370> put

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
manufacturer but they don't always put

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.690 
manufacturer but they don't always put
it<00:06:18.730> on<00:06:18.850> these<00:06:19.030> jacks<00:06:19.450> so<00:06:20.290> that's<00:06:21.040> a<00:06:21.250> couple<00:06:21.430> of

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
it on these jacks so that's a couple of

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.940 
it on these jacks so that's a couple of
possible<00:06:22.360> fixes<00:06:22.720> for<00:06:22.870> your<00:06:23.020> amp<00:06:23.320> I'm<00:06:23.620> sorry<00:06:23.860> I

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
possible fixes for your amp I'm sorry I

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.990 
possible fixes for your amp I'm sorry I
didn't<00:06:24.160> get<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.310> chance<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.640> show<00:06:24.760> you<00:06:24.850> how<00:06:24.940> to

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
didn't get a chance to show you how to

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.120 
didn't get a chance to show you how to
start<00:06:25.270> this<00:06:25.480> one<00:06:25.720> but<00:06:26.620> I'm<00:06:26.710> not<00:06:26.740> going<00:06:26.950> to<00:06:27.010> go

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
start this one but I'm not going to go

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.650 
start this one but I'm not going to go
through<00:06:27.250> that<00:06:27.370> process<00:06:27.550> because<00:06:28.030> mine's<00:06:28.450> not

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
through that process because mine's not

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.810 
through that process because mine's not
having<00:06:28.930> that<00:06:29.020> issue<00:06:29.230> so<00:06:29.620> so<00:06:30.550> it<00:06:30.640> could<00:06:30.790> be

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
having that issue so so it could be

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.640 
having that issue so so it could be
something<00:06:31.120> like<00:06:31.300> this<00:06:31.480> or<00:06:32.080> it<00:06:32.200> could<00:06:32.410> be<00:06:32.530> the

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
something like this or it could be the

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.360 
something like this or it could be the
solder<00:06:33.390> joints<00:06:34.390> on<00:06:34.510> these<00:06:34.660> legs<00:06:35.230> to<00:06:35.860> the<00:06:36.010> input

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
solder joints on these legs to the input

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.950 
solder joints on these legs to the input
Jack<00:06:36.610> so<00:06:36.910> hopefully<00:06:37.540> this<00:06:37.630> video<00:06:37.750> has<00:06:37.930> been

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
Jack so hopefully this video has been

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.659 
Jack so hopefully this video has been
helpful<00:06:38.050> give<00:06:38.470> a<00:06:38.500> give<00:06:38.919> a<00:06:38.950> question<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:39.610> the
