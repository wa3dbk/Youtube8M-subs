00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 good people heard the smell of 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.509
 Sonic messages are especially 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 from one that looks like an acre pita 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.490
 It's good I'll explain why 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.250
 this message and such that you have played 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.260
 sonic cd you will know that the Japanese version 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.480
 and the American have different music 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.220
 as you do not know why, because 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.779
 Americans changed the music that's already 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 normal the halos were going to do very 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.320
 often 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.990
 well, you writing a code to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.399
 beginning of the game that was down below 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.600
 or left to right and squeezing it 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 would you like a radio menu to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 listen to the game points 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.679
 and aside to listen before 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.449
 game also if I wrote some codes 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.280
 specific this part in images and 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.960
 among them was the image that I am going 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.159
 to show but it's not the image is not left 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 bad roll is the music 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.329
 good the music plus the image because the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 music if you listen to the game either 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.079
 affects so much but the truth is that the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.119
 people in the roll so good the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 you take off or I'm going to put it to ring 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:02.309
 the music of this to demonstrate those that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 it's true and that you do not listen and then you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.509
 I'm going to show you why it's such a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.009
 music is where in the game it sounds 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.380
 which is against the ham but well I'm going 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.000
 to show and then the Japanese version 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
 so you can see what is different and what 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.670
 it really says the good message let's go 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670
 there 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.269
 to 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.700
 and well this is what we find 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.380
 when putting the color the truth is that it gives 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.330
 pretty bad roll 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 the Japanese does not give anything bad 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.510
 because different music gives more 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.980
 on the roll of this is music not to the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.610
 image but if not exposed in the image 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.370
 more the music gives here a few 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.430
 Japanese facts in it puts funk and without 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.970
 final 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 they will be interpreters 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.740
 what the Spanish work would be the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.720
 fun is infinite company of mowing 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.640
 but people started to invent that 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:10.640
 here they put the one of weak and without end 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 the price what translated into Spanish 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 it would be the infinite demons 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.170
 company has therefore measured well now 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.060
 I'm going to teach the Japanese version and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.060
 you will see how this changes a lot 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.030
 well this is the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.110
 if Japanese pressure 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.170
 the first time I had problems with 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.060
 them because I did not sound music like that 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.950
 I hope that this time if for the moment 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.900
 it's going well so I 'm going to put it on 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.140
 codes again and I'll show you how it is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.550
 the music here so you can see that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.450
 we achieve and here is what makes the 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.450
 scary message or not 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.169
 yes 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 yes 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.440
 everyday 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.440
 do not 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.930
 from titles 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.979
 to change much hope the good thing 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:19.199
 that has served you well and to those who 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.919
 you have caught something scared of the game by 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.539
 blame for this, that is, do not pay attention to it 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.770
 only music and people if I lie 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.680
 the rest so I hope that I have 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.509
 served something until next time 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.520
 and good that I had forgotten before 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.789
 here is the proof that this music 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.789
 it sounds 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.890
 the one in the image 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 Y 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.159
 ace 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.730
 look
