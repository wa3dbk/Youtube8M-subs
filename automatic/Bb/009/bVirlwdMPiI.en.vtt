00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.030 
want to won't want me to do and then I
make<00:03:49.680> up<00:03:50.070> my<00:03:50.100> mind<00:03:51.019> when<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.799> know<00:03:52.890> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
make up my mind when you know the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.289 
make up my mind when you know the
servers<00:03:53.400> all<00:03:53.549> sorted<00:03:53.850> out<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> can

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
servers all sorted out and I can

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.479 
servers all sorted out and I can
actually<00:03:54.500> maybe<00:03:55.500> talk<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:56.010> staff<00:03:56.250> because<00:03:56.430> i

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
actually maybe talk to staff because i

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.690 
actually maybe talk to staff because i
know<00:03:56.670> i've<00:03:57.209> spoken<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.780> captain<00:03:58.670> dragna<00:03:59.670> i
