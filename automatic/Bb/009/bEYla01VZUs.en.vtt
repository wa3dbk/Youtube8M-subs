00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and you get a perfect corner now if

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
and you get a perfect corner now if
you're<00:01:38.609> like<00:01:38.789> me<00:01:38.899> most<00:01:39.899> you<00:01:40.170> tried<00:01:40.560> mounting

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you're like me most you tried mounting

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.480 
you're like me most you tried mounting
hinges<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.179> success

hinges with very little success

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.620 
hinges with very little success
generally<00:01:44.490> what<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.210> slide<00:01:45.479> our

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
generally what we do is we slide our

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.929 
generally what we do is we slide our
hinge<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:45.990> place<00:01:46.369> mark<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> holes<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
hinge into place mark the holes of the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.349 
hinge into place mark the holes of the
pencil<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.630> drill<00:01:49.319> it<00:01:49.499> or<00:01:49.679> if<00:01:50.429> you<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.759> me<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
pencil and drill it or if you like me I

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:54.260 
pencil and drill it or if you like me I
take<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> drill<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.039> I<00:01:53.429> try<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.759> eyeball

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
take the drill bit and I try to eyeball

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.429 
take the drill bit and I try to eyeball
those<00:01:54.539> holes<00:01:54.869> come<00:01:55.770> out<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> hinge<00:01:57.439> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
those holes come out of that hinge now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.340 
those holes come out of that hinge now
the<00:01:58.499> problem<00:01:59.039> with<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.479> most<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the problem with this is that most of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
the problem with this is that most of
the<00:02:01.409> time<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.979> drill<00:02:02.189> bit<00:02:02.369> has<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> tendency<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the time the drill bit has a tendency to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.499 
the time the drill bit has a tendency to
walk<00:02:03.359> and<00:02:04.039> cause<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.280> hinge<00:02:05.639> to<00:02:05.909> slide

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
walk and cause the hinge to slide

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.850 
walk and cause the hinge to slide
off-center<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:09.390> cases<00:02:09.720> even<00:02:10.649> miss

align itself or strip out the holes

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470 
align itself or strip out the holes
which<00:02:13.740> make<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.130> frustrating

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
which make it very frustrating

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
which make it very frustrating
to<00:02:15.540> get<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> nice<00:02:16.050> clean<00:02:16.349> look<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.860> you

away<00:02:26.760> from<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> edge<00:02:27.680> well<00:02:28.680> let<00:02:28.769> me<00:02:28.890> show<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
away from the edge well let me show you

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.949 
away from the edge well let me show you
what<00:02:29.280> we've<00:02:29.430> come<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.480> make<00:02:30.510> hinge

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
what we've come up with to make hinge

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.640 
what we've come up with to make hinge
mounting<00:02:31.769> very<00:02:32.190> simple<00:02:32.730> they're<00:02:33.629> called<00:02:34.019> self

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
mounting very simple they're called self

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
mounting very simple they're called self
centering<00:02:35.040> drill<00:02:35.370> bits<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:36.660> way<00:02:36.780> they<00:02:36.959> work

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
centering drill bits the way they work

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.809 
centering drill bits the way they work
is<00:02:37.410> they've<00:02:37.590> got<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> little<00:02:38.040> cone<00:02:38.250> shape<00:02:38.640> on

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
is they've got a little cone shape on

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.020 
is they've got a little cone shape on
the<00:02:38.940> tip<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.269> them<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.599> it's<00:02:40.319> spring-loaded

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
the tip of them and it's spring-loaded

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.449 
the tip of them and it's spring-loaded
that<00:02:42.030> cone<00:02:42.440> matches<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> taper<00:02:43.829> of<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.129> hinge

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that cone matches the taper of the hinge

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.729 
that cone matches the taper of the hinge
as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.480> place<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.780> into<00:02:46.140> place

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
as you place that into place

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.289 
as you place that into place
basically<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.519> drill<00:02:47.730> bit<00:02:47.879> comes<00:02:48.090> out

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
basically the drill bit comes out

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.530 
basically the drill bit comes out
perfectly<00:02:48.930> centered<00:02:49.349> every<00:02:50.220> single<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
perfectly centered every single time it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.599 
perfectly centered every single time it
also<00:02:52.200> doesn't<00:02:52.680> allow<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.890> hinge<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.430> walk

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
also doesn't allow the hinge to walk

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.300 
also doesn't allow the hinge to walk
around<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.090> opening<00:02:55.010> simply<00:02:56.010> place<00:02:56.280> your

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
around the opening simply place your

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.940 
around the opening simply place your
hinge<00:02:56.760> into<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.780> cutout<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:59.250> your<00:02:59.459> bit<00:02:59.670> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
hinge into the cutout take your bit and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.550 
hinge into the cutout take your bit and
drill<00:03:01.950> four<00:03:02.430> different<00:03:03.150> holes<00:03:03.560> perfectly

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
drill four different holes perfectly

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:26.820 
drill four different holes perfectly
centered<00:03:05.329> every<00:03:06.329> single<00:03:06.629> time

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.640 

and<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:27.950> end<00:03:28.130> up<00:03:28.310> with<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.520> nice<00:03:28.850> straight<00:03:29.810> flush

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
and we end up with a nice straight flush

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.860 
and we end up with a nice straight flush
mount<00:03:31.340> every<00:03:32.060> single<00:03:32.330> time

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
mount every single time

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.840 
mount every single time
