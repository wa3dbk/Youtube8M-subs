00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
most three games that I find it's way

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.300 
most three games that I find it's way
better<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.719> two<00:02:00.869> players<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.679> that's<00:02:02.069> just

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
better with two players and that's just
