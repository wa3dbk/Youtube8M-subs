00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.730
 sponsor a team in Formula 1 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.189
 the clio cup in brazil and have no 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.830
 model with at least sport face 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.090
 offered here in our market was a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 problem that the renault had to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.480
 solve the solution came with megane 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.779
 stream a bold design and only 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.359
 black color it is a special series but 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 if you please you have a chance of becoming a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.300
 version for the front transformation 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 were placed new grade bumper 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 which give the air thrown sideways mini 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 skirts and logos and stream to see 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.719
 I'll clash with a showy 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 airports 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 now for us the graphite painting of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.489
 door handles and mirrors 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.329
 wheels could be the same and did not count 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.190
 different on each inner piece 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 exclusive coating of the seats and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.870
 steering wheel shift lever leather all 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.510
 with red stitching to highlight the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 style but if you are waiting for that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.979
 something else under the hood 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 my friend and my friend fell off the horse is 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.630
 that the mechanics are exactly the same as 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.090
 Mexicans and even strange with 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 1.6 engine and turkey grand tour 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.330
 we walked in version 2.0 with exchange 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.610
 138 horsepower allows you to 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.979
 performance that can be considered good 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 only for a car and it was said 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.880
 is far from pleased that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 also hinders the automatic transmission with 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.780
 only four gears allowing 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.670
 sequential exchanges 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.670
 the sport has nothing 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.869
 consumption remained averaged 6.6 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.689
 kilometers per liter of gasoline in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.159
 our testing circuit in the city and 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.530
 half road and no one enthuses 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.329
 on the other hand efficient disc brakes 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 four-wheel drive and steering with 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.649
 variable electric assist very 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.640
 need to be directed with 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.829
 tranquility 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 only about 30 a pat on the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.429
 safety 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.069
 it has standard with front air bags and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.489
 abs system on the brakes and belt of three 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.250
 points for all five occupants but 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.989
 lack what the headrest for those who 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.500
 goes in the middle and that the models 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.350
 have toothpick savings not 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.460
 The soft suspension allows for smooth 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.620
 comfortable 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.200
 in addition to efficiently absorb the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 irregularities helps to maintain 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.400
 a low internal noise level and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.160
 ensures good stability 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.130
 the cool space for five adults 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.930
 520 liters trunk a charm of the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.630
 card in place of the key 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.540
 complements the version-based stream 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 dynamique who comes equipped has 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.070
 with the aerodynamic kit 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.830
 exclusive version which gives you a 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.080
 interesting cost benefit ratio 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.020
 renewed feather does not yet provide 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.540
 the 2.0 engine with flex technology 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.880
 Anyway if you do not mind walking 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.700
 with the lamb in wolfskin 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.370
 ex 30 may be an alternative to 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.370
 At least 30 brave he has until 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.380
 let's remember the pros and cons 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.750
 pointed by the corn 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.290
 internal space, stability and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.330
 negative suspension consumption exchange 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.240
 security and safety 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.850
 the reputation wins this in automatic 240 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.540
 It costs 64 thousand five hundred and fifty 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.340
 real 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.550
