00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:15.100
 hello well look today I thought we're going 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.380
 to do a little bit of their and I've 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.900
 prepared everything to make the video a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.760
 a little more 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.450
 and I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.250
 ingredients are these 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.570
 we have algae here to make 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.610
 we also have two palettes policies 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:36.800
 I have known some nice prawns 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.400
 and a little cucumber we have here the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.860
 smoked salmon the tortilla 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.860
 and there we also have the water 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.350
 here we also have a little bit of 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 rice vinegar and also here we have 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.100
 and he 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.190
 It can be special to make sushi or 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.800
 we can also put the pump rice 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.220
 the title that we will make the page because that 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.130
 is the most similar to make sushi with 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.280
 this and we will start to bake and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.460
 we have the boiling water and we are going to 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.620
 add rice rice I have not told you 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.750
 before you have that he has watered with 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.500
 water and you have to raise it until 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.210
 lose all the starch you have and leave 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.490
 the water is very soft 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.180
 they have already done this and then you are seeing 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.180
 let's add 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 for 10 minutes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.470
 At medium heat I put two glasses of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.230
 rice 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.230
 and two and a half of water 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.130
 both airs 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.950
 we will cover 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.099
 i 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.459
 about 10 minutes 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 Well, here we already have the rice 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.840
 been ten minutes boiling on fire 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.090
 means we will let stand other 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.569
 ten more minutes while we go 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.530
 to prepare the sauce his dressing called 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:33.280
 more then for this we will need the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.680
 rice vinegar and sugar so 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.630
 let's start moving the fire 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.520
 because this has to be diluted in the water 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.100
 in the pot 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.819
 and we add half glass 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.099
 finish the iron 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.310
 and a half glass a little less than 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.310
 sugar 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.910
 we will move it 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.950
 Well, I already put it aside 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.800
 minutes of the reposado and now we are going to 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 add the sauce we have made 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.310
 previously it has only been dissolve 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.350
 a little sugar with vinegar 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.540
 we are going to remove everything well so that 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.390
 unifiquen 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.590
 and then let it rest in a tray 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:23.030
 in a dish to cool and we can already 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 proceed to see them 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.250
 we already have the rice 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.170
 here we have the altar 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.600
 the face that is lawful we will put the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.350
 part outside and here the inside 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.650
 let's proceed to put the side 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.490
 we will submit the good ones a little bit 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.520
 then we take the error 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.510
 and we are going to extend it throughout the 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.510
 surface of the face 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.410
 we have already extended the car 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.580
 and now let's put a stick 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.580
 of crab well 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.000
 more or less 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.650
 let's cut 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.389
 well we will put why 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.389
 wine 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.490
 roll it up 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.250
 good ones 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.730
 second we have already put the word milestone and 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.870
 Now we are going to put this as a 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.560
 little tortilla 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.560
 he is doing well 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.169
 but it breaks is to put a little moment in 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.780
 the freezer so that it hardens a bit 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.540
 and then it 's simpler and this is the 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.020
 half of half 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.020
 A) Yes 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.800
 others
