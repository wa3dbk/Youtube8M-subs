something really quick this right here
this<00:03:15.920> boomerang<00:03:16.489> teardrop<00:03:17.360> controller<00:03:17.930> is

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
this boomerang teardrop controller is

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.979 
this boomerang teardrop controller is
what<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> call<00:03:18.739> it

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.180 

this<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.100> for<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.340> ps1<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.709> Alps

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
this is for the ps1 this is the Alps

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.150 
this is for the ps1 this is the Alps
interactive<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.780> think<00:03:30.590> they<00:03:30.709> call<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:30.950> a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
interactive I think they call it a

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.880 
interactive I think they call it a
boomerang<00:03:31.519> controller<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.620> for<00:03:33.799> the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
boomerang controller but this is for the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.670 
boomerang controller but this is for the
ps2<00:03:34.540> ps1<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.370> had<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.519> crazy-looking<00:03:38.000> d-pad

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
ps2 ps1 and it had a crazy-looking d-pad

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.600 
ps2 ps1 and it had a crazy-looking d-pad
crazy<00:03:39.680> d-pad<00:03:40.250> it's<00:03:40.489> very<00:03:40.670> comfortable<00:03:42.610> very

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
crazy d-pad it's very comfortable very

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.400 
crazy d-pad it's very comfortable very
different<00:03:44.120> from<00:03:44.269> any<00:03:44.480> d-pad<00:03:44.810> I've<00:03:44.989> ever<00:03:45.140> seen

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.280 
different from any d-pad I've ever seen
before<00:03:45.820> as<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:46.940> can<00:03:47.120> see<00:03:47.299> there<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.110> got

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
before as you can see there and it's got

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.930 
before as you can see there and it's got
