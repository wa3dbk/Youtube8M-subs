00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.480
Demonstrate, is your right, farther more your obligation

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.600
Demonstrate, if under your chest there is still a beating heart

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.220
Demonstrate, is the public awareness arising

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040
Demonstrate, is the human tide displaying

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.780
Demonstrate, is your right, farther more your obligation

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860
Demonstrate, if under your chest there is still a beating heart

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.540
Demonstrate, is the public awareness arising

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.620
Demonstrate, is the human tide displaying

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.720
In this world of uncertain chaos

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.160
The people are wondering where are we going?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.420
If we are free men or slaves

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.280
There’s no more difference in this hole we are in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.100
We have the power to find the exit

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
To build union, to look other choices

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.680
But also the responsibility

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.300
To change our future and not aloud this anymore

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.040
I demonstrate, raise my voice, I manifest!

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.120
I keep going in the walk I defend

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.120
The legitimate right of expression and movement

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.400
And I differ from vertical laws

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880
Bipolar reforms, rapes, kidnappings and massacres

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.180
That’s why I demonstrate

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.860
Against the most obscene ever committed crime

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640
And it name is...  government!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.900
Here in my land, things are tuff

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.800
The same happens in Salvador, Brazil and Honduras

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.200
This won’t stop until we abolish the dictatorship

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.380
In democracy disguise, being a rebel is my culture

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.240
Listen the noise of my people resurging.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.640
The thread containing us is breaking

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.860
And we fight the lies of the bad government Wake up!

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.560
Together we gathered our voices to tell you Demonstrate!

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.240
Demonstrate, more than a right is an obligation

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.460
When the media lie is because you are right

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.640
Not even with bombs and shotguns will hush us

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.880
The accumulate anger that surrounds the nation

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.680
That’s why I will insist

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.500
That’s why I will resist

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.200
Because everything we do today

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
Or not do will make history.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.980
Wake up call, to my untruly friend

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.760
I’m the Callus I don’t try, it became evil

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.560
I’m not god to call you back home

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.240
But for sure in your pain you will recognize to your own race

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.000
For my race the spirit will speak

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.240
Do you understand what I’m talking about?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.940
You will understand when a don’t discriminate your own children

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.760
The message is the key, a feat from front

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.480
The demonstrations are here to wake you up from your trance!

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.520
I’m my people’s eco... I’m my people’s eco!

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.400
The anger arises... The anger arises!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.100
I’m the free spirit... I’m the free spirit!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.040
The revolution explodes... !The Revolution explodes!

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.400
Mi voice, your voice is a cry of hope

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.000
And the only way to do this battle

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.400
Rise our weapons

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.500
The Revolution is already win

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.160
Take the Street and act stop being indifferent

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.220
The life you have is your look for transcendence

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.520
Because there’s no kindness in any government

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.880
I just believe in the people’s organization

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.800
In those who look beyond the establishment

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.420
In those who look for freedom because they have motifs

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.080
All together we keep fighting

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.920
Looking in us, the biggest change of all.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.880
With reason, with each collaboration...

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.420
Shoulder by shoulder, connection with everyone and everythinhg, with...

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.660
The conscious and the intention

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.460
The experience of the generation

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.280
Joining strengths to create it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.100
And we are one vibrating, connecting

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.900
Each path crossing borders

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.580
Each warrior leaving a footprint

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.520
Demonstrate, this song is a protest song

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.120
Defeat the fear and joining to the proposal

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.800
Demonstrate, raising the voice everywhere

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.740
Painting walls, organize all the neighbourhoods

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.840
Demonstrate, this protest poetry

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.420
The barricades and demonstrations are the answer

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.080
Demonstrate, there’s other possible world

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.580
The union makes us stronger and our dream is invincible.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.640
This is the every day drama

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.440
Is the coldest war, against your own people

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.340
Our indifference won’t solve it we need to manifest

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.420
The violence here has a silence shape

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.020
And if you don’t thing in shouting it

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.500
Here nobody will do it in your name…

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.660
Doesn’t matter if you are a man or a woman

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.880
The power is inside you, inside your being

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.760
They want to hush us but we have learned to shout

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.600
To protest and was only because we were in need

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.920
Which pacifism? Tell me you Which violence?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.000
Here people defend as the Mapuche en their land

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.680
Make the streets to talk, to shout, to burst

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.860
The powerful most feel that the combat has started

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.600
The misery they have submitted us

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.840
Will be the gunpowder that will blow their castles.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.800
Some request peace, others look for wars

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.580
In this everyday life you don’t get poison

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.400
Enchained to all kind of stupid laws

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.660
That burst in your hands just leaving scars

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.300
marks and footprints of stupid labelling

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.500
Trashy adverts promoting violence today

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.060
A new generation of warriors is born without fear for protest

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.940
Rising the voice all the people resists.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.500
Demonstrate, do it on your own way

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.380
In this battle filed we go shoulder by shoulder

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.160
We are an infinite battalion of the others

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.260
We are invincible because we found out there’s no I but us

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.720
This retinue, moves forward not a single step back

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.500
Colouring the walk with so mush adversity in it

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.300
This is the power of speech that they can’t hush

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.100
Because many blood has been offered in this search for freedom

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.480
When the neighbourhood is in danger, all is aloud

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.380
The only not aloud thing is not fight for it my friend

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.180
The main battle is the enemy’s mind

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060
That’s why we will demonstrate, for the same reason

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.860
The Revolution, the school of the justice and hard working people

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.620
The Revolution and idea from the heart

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.420
Don’t be scared to shout, fight for every reason

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.000
Because those who died with honour will never be forgotten

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.360
The streets are burning, the heart is beating

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.340
The blood is hot

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.580
The people is no longer stopping

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.400
We go straight, consciously, bravely

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.120
To up and to the front, always!

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.760
Even though the government wants to finish us

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.220
With their power abuse

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.240
We won’t die in our knees we will live stand in our feet
