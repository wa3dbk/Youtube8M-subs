assumed that that was a pretty stunning

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.770 
assumed that that was a pretty stunning
moment<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.600> kept

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
moment for you you know what I just kept

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.030 
moment for you you know what I just kept
trying<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.079> tell<00:01:55.259> myself<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.799> some

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
trying to tell myself there was some

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.219 
trying to tell myself there was some
other<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
other reason for it and I think like a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.510 
other reason for it and I think like a
lot<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> people<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.890> knew<00:01:59.009> him<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> lot<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
lot of people that knew him and a lot of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.310 
lot of people that knew him and a lot of
the<00:01:59.670> wrestlers<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.240> think<00:02:00.810> everyone<00:02:01.110> that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the wrestlers I think everyone that's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
the wrestlers I think everyone that's
sort<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.590> coming<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.340> terms<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
sort of coming to terms with it this

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.569 
sort of coming to terms with it this
right<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.140> everyone<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:05.280> hoping

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
right now I think everyone was hoping

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
right now I think everyone was hoping
there<00:02:05.729> was<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:06.000> other<00:02:06.439> there<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
there was some other there was a that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800 
there was some other there was a that
there<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> better<00:02:08.429> explanation<00:02:08.789> than<00:02:09.330> this

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
there was a better explanation than this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.100 
there was a better explanation than this
you<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.319> uh<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.870> going

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you know but uh it's I think it's going

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.900 
you know but uh it's I think it's going
to<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.560> long<00:02:13.890> time<00:02:14.099> before<00:02:14.310> anybody<00:02:14.760> gets

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910

think<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.690> there's<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.989> deeper<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:02.400> goes

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
think that there's a deeper it goes

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.729 
think that there's a deeper it goes
beyond<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.120> at<00:04:03.630> this<00:04:03.870> point<00:04:04.109> is<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.560> going

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
beyond that at this point is this going

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.379 
beyond that at this point is this going
to<00:04:04.799> bring<00:04:04.950> wrestling<00:04:05.340> data<00:04:05.519> leaves<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.030> say<00:04:06.209> is
