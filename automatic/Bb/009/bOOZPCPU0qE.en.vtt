00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
recently updated some stuff and i got my

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
recently updated some stuff and i got my
eyes<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> dark<00:00:37.500> piece<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.640> never

first time killing them but you know the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
first time killing them but you know the
drops<00:00:52.320> are<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> good<00:00:53.309> while<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
drops are not that good while the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
drops are not that good while the
requirements<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:55.199> too<00:00:55.260> high<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
requirements are way too high for this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
requirements are way too high for this
creature<00:00:56.430> skill<00:00:56.940> 90<00:00:57.719> Slayer<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
creature skill 90 Slayer and you have to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.810 
creature skill 90 Slayer and you have to
start<00:00:59.129> moaning<00:00:59.460> parts<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.480> access<00:01:01.230> them

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
start moaning parts and to access them

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
start moaning parts and to access them
but<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> complete<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> morning<00:01:04.049> ends

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
but if you complete the morning ends

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
but if you complete the morning ends
part<00:01:04.530> 2<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> use<00:01:05.519> layering<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.299> teleport

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
part 2 you can use layering to teleport

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.140 
part 2 you can use layering to teleport
to<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:07.950> useful<00:01:08.700> however

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to them and that is very useful however

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
to them and that is very useful however
what<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.619> beasts<00:01:10.920> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
what I do like about these beasts is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
what I do like about these beasts is
that<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.760> unlimited<00:01:12.020> agron<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that they have unlimited agron you so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800 
that they have unlimited agron you so
you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.070> stay<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:15.000> hour<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.570> two

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can stay there for one hour or two

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
you can stay there for one hour or two
hours<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.860> still<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.189> attacking<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hours and it will still be attacking you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270 
hours and it will still be attacking you
now<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> unfortunate<00:01:19.259> thing<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.979> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
now the unfortunate thing is that I have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
now the unfortunate thing is that I have
not<00:01:20.460> managed<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> single<00:01:21.659> Darko<00:01:22.290> drop

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
not managed to get a single Darko drop

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.700 
not managed to get a single Darko drop

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
when the drop rate is one of 512 and I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.179 
when the drop rate is one of 512 and I
killed<00:01:25.950> 1000<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.759> them<00:01:26.939> oh<00:01:27.119> boy<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.229> 2.7
