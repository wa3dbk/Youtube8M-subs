00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.939
 hello girls this video is a demo of the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.820
 new baby lipsticks from the line of 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.460
 color sensation and they are called beats them 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.029
 I'm going to show three of the colors them 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.399
 They took out a total of 10 colors and the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.009
 I want to compare with 2 labials of the 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.610
 Mark Mack that I think they are almost 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.610
 identical 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.190
 the first color is called fat jokin and 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.370
 is the one I have on and this is my 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.690
 favorite indeed I thought it was going to be a 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.000
 little bit more orange 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.520
 but it's more pink 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.520
 so I 'm going to show you the color 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.550
 this is one of those that I want to do the 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.700
 comparison with marc the one that I think it 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.420
 it seems quite is not identical but it 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.270
 It seems a lot of the brand of mac is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.270
 call so much passion or impasse 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.660
 that is this 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 and I'm going to put it in the part from here to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.650
 side of maybelline color so that 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.650
 see the difference 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.720
 it's not exactly the same but I think it 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:43.210
 It seems a lot 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.020
 the next color is 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.020
 rose 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.870
 if I'm going to put in the part from here to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.880
 side 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.189
 it's like one more color of yours 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.770
 I also liked this because it is 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.530
 as stronger 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.369
 and the last color I have is called 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.369
 fuchsia flash 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.290
 this stake 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.000
 and this last one is the other one that I want 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.030
 compare with one of mac that is called 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.030
 candy union of max 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.159
 again they are not identical but I think that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.159
 they look very much 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.980
 here is the mac and the baby 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.870
 of maybelline 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.959
 good my opinion about these 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.480
 lipsticks is that I loved the quality 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.790
 it's super good they're good economic 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.790
 they cost around 5 to 7 dollars 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.150
 It depends where you buy it and good 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.069
 really like compare with others who 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.890
 a lipstick only also costs 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.160
 around 15 dollars and I got 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.610
 the 3 labials level by the same 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.799
 price of only one gun so I 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.519
 they enchanted a friend also tried them and 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.610
 they really liked it, they really are 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.489
 tremendous quality and for the price I 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.609
 really loved it and for almost all the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.349
 day so I recommend them and thank you

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.989
