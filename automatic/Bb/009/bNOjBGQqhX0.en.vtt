00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.780
 p 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.789
 the project for a long time 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.069
 your toronto player 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:35.420
 I have three more years of contract a rumor that is not pure smoke i stayed 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.930
 it's a complicated year we've gone far away from other peoples young team with 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.740
 very willing to work and well I think we are more team with two years not 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.990
 xinhua because he never knows book thinks that's why no goal 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.010
 I think we have a lot of talent said we are going to see what happens 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.900
 go from day to day to day to day critics 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.670
 I did many things for all the people are wrong 90 days but like other 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.540
 thing but today well good with the opponent team many 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.710
 we have a team with a desire to work young 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 I think we will be a team 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.930
 for less fun and really 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 is to come if that is what the press says but not dismissed for a topic 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.790
 of the salary limit that throw it rough of snow and then why did they kill with 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.460
 a contract of the source 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.220
 so positive not that playing it playing quite well as the neighborhood of three in 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.890
 the last second in the quarterfinals that he places in a lung he fights for the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 medals 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 they will go to their positive service that they validate we will be again there fighting for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.580
 everything and it is enough that in addition adults pass page pd man we can tell 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.710
 to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.290
 to people who are 22 24 years old to withdraw from the selection 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.800
 sometimes I think you have to have a little bit of the head and know a little bit of what 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 it is talked about and for having a player not be next year but 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.640
 that the group are the same and we are there 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 and we still have the appalling 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.980
 or definitive has lost a game after many years 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.520
 the year wants to return bold
