that<00:02:48.710> was<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.160> same<00:02:49.460> with<00:02:50.060> magazine<00:02:50.720> comics

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
that was the same with magazine comics

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.460 
that was the same with magazine comics
when<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.560> would<00:02:51.650> get<00:02:51.770> them<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:54.110> what's

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
when we would get them but what's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.040 
when we would get them but what's
different<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:56.540> doesn't<00:02:56.720> say

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
different is that this it doesn't say

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.380 
different is that this it doesn't say
like<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.440> other<00:02:57.590> one<00:02:57.830> did<00:02:57.860> um<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.730> second<00:02:59.150> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
like the other one did um the second it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.130 
like the other one did um the second it
doesn't<00:02:59.630> say

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
doesn't say

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.110 
doesn't say
look<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:01.250> find<00:03:01.430> out<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.760> happens<00:03:02.060> next

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
look for to find out what happens next

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
look for to find out what happens next
see<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.630> movie<00:03:02.960> this<00:03:03.380> one<00:03:03.590> doesn't<00:03:03.890> say<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
see the movie this one doesn't say that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.030 
see the movie this one doesn't say that
and<00:03:04.460> there's<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.700> third<00:03:05.060> movie<00:03:05.420> hello

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
and there's a third movie hello

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.070 
and there's a third movie hello
so<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.130> just<00:03:07.220> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.520> leaves<00:03:07.700> off<00:03:07.970> there<00:03:08.270> but

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
so it just kind of leaves off there but

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.810 
so it just kind of leaves off there but
whatever<00:03:09.290> most<00:03:09.860> people<00:03:10.220> know<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.550> there's<00:03:10.760> a

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
I don't know I need this happened with a

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.000 
I don't know I need this happened with a
couple<00:04:20.600> other<00:04:20.630> people<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.320> probably<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
couple other people and probably the

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.850 
couple other people and probably the
majority<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:23.419> them<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.140> when<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.350> open<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> up

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
majority of them is when you open it up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.290 
majority of them is when you open it up
and<00:04:25.040> you've<00:04:25.130> read<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.490> couple<00:04:25.669> times<00:04:25.940> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and you've read it a couple times and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.880 
and you've read it a couple times and
kind<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.600> been<00:04:26.720> wearing<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.140> out<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.650> pages

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
kind of been wearing and out the pages

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.560 
kind of been wearing and out the pages
fall<00:04:28.310> out<00:04:28.660> cuz<00:04:29.660> it's<00:04:30.169> like<00:04:30.550> it's<00:04:31.550> stick<00:04:32.000> binded

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
fall out cuz it's like it's stick binded

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.050 
fall out cuz it's like it's stick binded
like<00:04:32.810> glue<00:04:33.500> ish<00:04:33.710> kind<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.160> bind<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:34.850> not

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
like glue ish kind of bind it it's not

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.540 
like glue ish kind of bind it it's not
string<00:04:36.050> binded<00:04:36.470> which<00:04:36.710> keeps<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.100> a<00:04:37.160> lot<00:04:37.340> more

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
string binded which keeps it a lot more

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.030 
string binded which keeps it a lot more
secure<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.470> would<00:04:39.710> really<00:04:39.919> recommend

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
secure so I would really recommend

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.159 
secure so I would really recommend
getting<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.790> hardback<00:04:41.240> one<00:04:41.570> but<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:42.050> the

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
getting the hardback one but but the

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:42.850 
getting the hardback one but but the
hardbacks

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
hardbacks

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.170 
hardbacks
they<00:04:43.160> do<00:04:43.220> cost<00:04:43.580> more<00:04:45.490> paper<00:04:46.490> cuts<00:04:46.850> is<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
they do cost more paper cuts is the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.920 
they do cost more paper cuts is the
people<00:04:47.450> who<00:04:47.510> made<00:04:47.690> them<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:47.990> don't<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.380> iris

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
people who made them I don't think iris

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.920 
people who made them I don't think iris
but<00:04:49.350> uh<00:04:50.419> 12:19<00:04:51.419> 5<00:04:52.039> or<00:04:53.039> 99<00:04:53.520> probably<00:04:54.030> just<00:04:54.240> $13

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
but uh 12:19 5 or 99 probably just $13

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.719 
but uh 12:19 5 or 99 probably just $13
actually<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.410> same<00:04:55.650> as<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.039> glatorian<00:04:56.370> czar
