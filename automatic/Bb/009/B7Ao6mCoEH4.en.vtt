special occasion are you going to choose

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.149

a<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.090> expensive<00:01:27.330> wine<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.020> take<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> from

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
a more expensive wine and take it from

there
but<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.880> should<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.479> much<00:01:31.100> find<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.189> wine

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
