hours<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.170> film<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.860> because<00:02:05.550> we<00:02:05.730> needed

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
hours of film and because we needed

different angles and everything and we
added<00:02:07.920> stuff<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.460> which<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:08.850> amazing<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
added stuff in which was amazing and I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.540 
added stuff in which was amazing and I
loved<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.290> Kenny<00:02:10.770> had<00:02:11.010> her<00:02:11.100> do<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.430> their

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
loved what Kenny had her do with their

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.640 
loved what Kenny had her do with their
hands<00:02:11.850> so<00:02:11.880> Jane<00:02:12.270> would<00:02:12.570> go<00:02:13.170> every<00:02:13.470> which<00:02:13.590> way

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
hands so Jane would go every which way

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.770 
hands so Jane would go every which way
with<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.130> magic<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.390> what

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
with the magic I really like that what

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.330 
with the magic I really like that what
was<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.990> like<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.320> between<00:02:16.740> takes<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.220> would

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
was it like in between takes what would

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.290 
was it like in between takes what would
you<00:02:17.430> guys<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.760> cut<00:02:17.970> doing<00:02:18.450> singing<00:02:20.240> they<00:02:21.240> were

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
you guys be cut doing singing they were

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.820 
you guys be cut doing singing they were
definitely<00:02:21.570> like<00:02:21.990> moments<00:02:22.410> when<00:02:22.560> there's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
definitely like moments when there's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.040 
definitely like moments when there's
like<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> breakout<00:02:23.550> singing<00:02:24.000> think<00:02:24.420> cuz<00:02:24.780> Kenny

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
like a breakout singing think cuz Kenny

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.260 
like a breakout singing think cuz Kenny
would<00:02:25.290> start<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> little<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.310> chant<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
would start like a little a chant and

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.750 
would start like a little a chant and
then<00:02:27.390> we'd<00:02:27.600> all<00:02:27.720> join<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.470> yeah<00:02:29.430> we

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
then we'd all join in and yeah we

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.430 
then we'd all join in and yeah we
probably<00:02:30.150> wasted<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.960> lot<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.140> time<00:02:31.350> doing<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
probably wasted a lot of time doing that

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.080 
probably wasted a lot of time doing that
but<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.650> mean<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.220> fun<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.640> know<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:35.970> to
