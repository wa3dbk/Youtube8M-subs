00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.530
 there are one animal terms of this 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.600
 Well, this time we are in a video 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.960
 informative about when it comes out what 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.779
 it would be minecraft little television 0 points 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.849
 9.04 Sorry pasta looks fuzzy but 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.800
 the recorder I do not know you have a problem 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.410
 it looks a bit fuzzy but understand 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.950
 fix good so to begin we are 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.770
 on the twitter of johann berg hansen and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.670
 Well, here on your twitter mentions 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.250
 what would be fixing what would be the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.560
 grass 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.070
 and all that and as we see here there are several 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.440
 tweets that have commented and well then 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.820
 have a problem apparently with this what 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.110
 what would that be and well let's move on 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.040
 now like the tweet 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.070
 of tomaso checking then here he put 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.980
 this photo that now went up we're going to 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.010
 open and as you see is a new language what 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.810
 which I do not know how it's called good because yes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.230
 a user asked him how he 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.120
 called but it was not said that it was forest and 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.030
 which is not that then I do not know if 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.440
 I was confusing or something like that but what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 which it is pretty pink looks like that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.340
 will be mixed and good, because here I come from a 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.550
 also that he had previously published 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 that he had not seen me and well then here 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.600
 down we had what would be what 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.600
 they commented about 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.640
 good then the content that will bring what 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.060
 what do you want jon 0.9 point zero and good 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.920
 because in the statement we will look up 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 down I think there's nothing else that is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 forget us because you need to show 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.590
 just as we are in what would be the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.290
 link that they leave in the description of 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.260
 video where they will live what would be the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.920
 they are good because it is the communication of iu 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.770
 that did a lot and now good so here 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.660
 I'm not going to translate all this but 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 here mentions tells us about the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.830
 nightmare minecraft 360 said what yes 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.840

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.560
 to rain 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
 no more here he mentioned about what 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 it would be when the live 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.430
 sing and all that come back but to us 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.860
 what we care about would be the king when 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.140
 the king is a place for good then in 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.349
 she is busy to post her 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.330
 arguments or statements they make about 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.400
