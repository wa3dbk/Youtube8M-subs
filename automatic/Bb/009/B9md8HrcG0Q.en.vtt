00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.220 

hey<00:00:12.120> guys<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:13.190> had<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> few<00:00:14.639> questions<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
hey guys I had a few questions on one of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170 
hey guys I had a few questions on one of
my<00:00:16.350> videos<00:00:16.529> about<00:00:17.010> nose<00:00:17.250> torque<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> ammonia

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
my videos about nose torque and ammonia

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.769 
my videos about nose torque and ammonia
so<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:19.260> had<00:00:19.410> some<00:00:19.439> PMS<00:00:20.449> people<00:00:21.449> asking<00:00:21.750> about

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
so I've had some PMS people asking about

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
so I've had some PMS people asking about
how<00:00:22.050> strong<00:00:22.470> each<00:00:22.920> one<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
how strong each one is so I'm going to a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.620 
how strong each one is so I'm going to a
video<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> difference<00:00:26.220> between<00:00:26.630> like

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
video on the difference between like

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
video on the difference between like
ammonia<00:00:28.080> tabs<00:00:28.789> which<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> something<00:00:30.269> like

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
ammonia tabs which is something like

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780 
ammonia tabs which is something like
this<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.340> don't<00:00:32.579> know<00:00:32.700> if

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
this you can get them I don't know if

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.920 
this you can get them I don't know if
you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:32.969> still<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.329> them<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.690> Walgreens

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you can still get them at like Walgreens

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
you can still get them at like Walgreens
for<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.590> reason<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.130> heard<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.610> came<00:00:35.820> or

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
for some reason I heard that you came or

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
for some reason I heard that you came or
so<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.719> them<00:00:36.840> online<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.219> look

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
so you can get them online but they look

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
so you can get them online but they look
something<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:40.200> happens<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
something like this and what happens is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.940 
something like this and what happens is
you<00:00:40.770> squeeze<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:42.360> releases<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
you squeeze them and that releases the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
you squeeze them and that releases the
whatever<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.329> smell<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> it's

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
whatever and you smell it and it's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
whatever and you smell it and it's
definitely<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.670> definitely<00:00:47.789> wakes<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.360> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
definitely it definitely wakes you up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.150 
definitely it definitely wakes you up
for<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> 1<00:00:50.129> rep<00:00:50.280> max<00:00:50.309> attempt<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> other

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
for like a 1 rep max attempt the other

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
for like a 1 rep max attempt the other
option<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.320> gonna<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.559> those<00:00:56.550> torque<00:00:57.890> where

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
option is gonna be those torque where

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.400 
option is gonna be those torque where
you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.640> places<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.629> zur<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you can get at places like in zur and a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
you can get at places like in zur and a
few<00:01:01.559> other<00:01:01.680> places<00:01:01.829> online<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> like

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
few other places online and this is like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.310 
few other places online and this is like
a<00:01:03.930> super<00:01:04.530> concentrated<00:01:05.780> version<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.900> guess<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a super concentrated version I guess of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.359 
a super concentrated version I guess of
ammonia<00:01:08.310> tabs<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:10.320> I'll<00:01:10.409> do<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.340> will

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
ammonia tabs so what I'll do is I will

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.840 
ammonia tabs so what I'll do is I will
test<00:01:12.299> both<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.400> idea<00:01:14.490> as

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
test both just so you can get an idea as

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
test both just so you can get an idea as
a<00:01:15.060> difference<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.720> strength<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.040> not

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a difference of strength if you have not

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
a difference of strength if you have not
tried<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.939> ammonia<00:01:18.330> tabs<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.140> would

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
tried the ammonia tabs I would

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
tried the ammonia tabs I would
definitely<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.950> those<00:01:20.070> first<00:01:20.840> instead<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
definitely go for those first instead of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.240 
definitely go for those first instead of
demonstrate<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> nose<00:01:22.740> torque<00:01:23.070> because

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
demonstrate to the nose torque because

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.060 
demonstrate to the nose torque because
usually<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.270> first<00:01:24.509> time<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> try<00:01:24.990> these

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
usually the first time you try these

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070 
usually the first time you try these
they're<00:01:26.070> enough<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.509> happens<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
they're enough and what happens is you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
they're enough and what happens is you
adapt<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.710> used<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.490> they're

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
adapt and get used to them and they're

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
adapt and get used to them and they're
not<00:01:29.640> quite<00:01:30.030> strong<00:01:30.299> enough<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.140> wouldn't

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
not quite strong enough so I wouldn't

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.560 
not quite strong enough so I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:31.860> using<00:01:32.220> them<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.820> every<00:01:33.240> set

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
recommend using them for like every set

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.160 
recommend using them for like every set
in<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.680> gym<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.659> it's<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:36.990> good

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in the gym because it's pretty not good

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
in the gym because it's pretty not good
for<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:38.250> brain<00:01:38.460> cells<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:39.180> whatnot<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.750> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
for your brain cells or whatnot so I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
for your brain cells or whatnot so I'm
going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> kill<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> few<00:01:40.500> showing<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> exactly

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
going to kill a few showing you exactly

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
going to kill a few showing you exactly
kind<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> how<00:01:42.390> strong<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:43.430> here<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
kind of how strong these are here it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.929 
kind of how strong these are here it
goes<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.060> ammonia<00:01:45.659> tab<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.610> squeeze

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
goes this is the ammonia tab you squeeze

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.760 
goes this is the ammonia tab you squeeze
it<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:50.119> happens<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.649 

yeah<00:01:56.770> that's<00:01:56.979> actually<00:01:57.330> fairly<00:01:58.330> strong

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
yeah that's actually fairly strong

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
yeah that's actually fairly strong
compared<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> ones<00:01:59.290> I've<00:01:59.409> used<00:01:59.440> before

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
compared to the ones I've used before

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.219 
compared to the ones I've used before
but<00:02:01.590> yeah<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.650> definitely<00:02:03.030> wakes<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.210> up<00:02:04.270> and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
but yeah it definitely wakes you up and

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.410 
but yeah it definitely wakes you up and
kind<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.560> makes<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.830> more<00:02:06.040> alert<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:07.090> know

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
kind of makes you more alert so I know

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.719 
kind of makes you more alert so I know
someone<00:02:08.080> posted<00:02:08.619> something<00:02:08.950> somewhere<00:02:09.399> about

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
someone posted something somewhere about

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.370 
someone posted something somewhere about
why<00:02:10.570> exactly<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.740> kind<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.240> amped<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.510> but

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
why exactly it kind of amped you up but

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.580 
why exactly it kind of amped you up but
I'll<00:02:14.860> see<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.130> can<00:02:15.280> find<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.590> I'm

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
I'll see if I can find that and I'm

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.530 
I'll see if I can find that and I'm
gonna<00:02:17.740> jump<00:02:17.980> straight<00:02:18.070> into<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.910> nose<00:02:19.120> torque

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
gonna jump straight into the nose torque

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.340 
gonna jump straight into the nose torque
which<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:21.180> fresh<00:02:22.180> bottle<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> lot<00:02:23.020> stronger

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
which a fresh bottle is a lot stronger

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.770 
which a fresh bottle is a lot stronger
than<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.950> not-so-fresh<00:02:24.640> bottle<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:27.780> don't

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
than a not-so-fresh bottle and I don't

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.660 
than a not-so-fresh bottle and I don't
normally<00:02:28.900> hit<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.830> while<00:02:30.130> I'm<00:02:30.220> sitting<00:02:30.489> in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
normally hit this while I'm sitting in

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
normally hit this while I'm sitting in
my<00:02:30.880> bedroom<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:33.870> guess<00:02:34.870> I'll<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.489> here

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
my bedroom so I guess I'll do this here

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.390 
my bedroom so I guess I'll do this here
it's<00:02:37.690> kind<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.019> tough<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:40.769> force<00:02:41.769> myself<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
it's kind of tough to force myself to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.580 
it's kind of tough to force myself to
jump<00:02:43.300> into<00:02:43.510> something<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.050> since<00:02:44.320> it's

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
jump into something like this since it's

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.160 
jump into something like this since it's
very<00:02:46.650> cause<00:02:47.650> optimal<00:02:48.160> time<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.489> do<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.170> all

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
very cause optimal time to do it so all

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.290 
very cause optimal time to do it so all
right<00:02:50.350> like<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> smell<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.190> already

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:09.380 

so<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:55.480> we<00:02:55.570> go<00:03:05.160> yeah<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.370> definitely

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.810 

stronger<00:03:10.390> especially<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.079> sniff<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.680> up

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
stronger especially if you sniff it up

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.080 
stronger especially if you sniff it up
sniff<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:12.970> unevenly<00:03:14.489> usually<00:03:15.489> catch<00:03:15.700> up<00:03:15.910> one

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
sniff it unevenly usually catch up one

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.080 
sniff it unevenly usually catch up one
nostril<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.750> could<00:03:16.870> literally<00:03:17.110> feel<00:03:17.500> it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
nostril and you could literally feel it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.360 
nostril and you could literally feel it
go<00:03:19.090> into<00:03:19.329> your<00:03:19.660> not<00:03:20.290> much<00:03:20.440> here<00:03:20.799> or<00:03:21.040> here<00:03:21.340> but

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
go into your not much here or here but

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
go into your not much here or here but
like<00:03:22.200> right<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.350> there<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.880> far<00:03:24.940> as<00:03:25.150> your<00:03:25.269> brain

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
like right in there as far as your brain

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.300 
like right in there as far as your brain
goes<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.410> liberate<00:03:26.739> feel<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.070> in<00:03:27.190> your

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
goes and you liberate feel it in your

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.430 
goes and you liberate feel it in your
head<00:03:27.519> but<00:03:29.459> yeah<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.700> I'd<00:03:30.790> recommend

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
head but yeah so I'd recommend

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.870 
head but yeah so I'd recommend
definitely<00:03:32.440> going<00:03:32.709> for<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> tabs<00:03:34.600> first

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
definitely going for the tabs first

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.520 
definitely going for the tabs first
buttkiss<00:03:36.880> or<00:03:37.180> if<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.390> end<00:03:37.570> up<00:03:37.690> doing<00:03:38.019> going

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
buttkiss or if you end up doing going

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.900 
buttkiss or if you end up doing going
for<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.739> nose<00:03:38.920> torque<00:03:39.280> after<00:03:39.640> you've<00:03:39.760> got

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
for the nose torque after you've got

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.960 
for the nose torque after you've got
their<00:03:40.090> tabs<00:03:40.799> definitely<00:03:41.799> try<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.250> before<00:03:42.670> you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
their tabs definitely try it before you

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.500 
their tabs definitely try it before you
go<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.540> meet<00:03:44.760> don't<00:03:45.760> go<00:03:45.940> nuts<00:03:46.090> you<00:03:46.239> know<00:03:46.329> if<00:03:46.390> to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
go to meet don't go nuts you know if to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.060 
go to meet don't go nuts you know if to
dump<00:03:46.750> your<00:03:46.870> nose<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.530> take<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.799> big

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
dump your nose in it and take a big

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.569 
dump your nose in it and take a big
whiff<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:49.260> I'll<00:03:50.260> try<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.560> first<00:03:50.799> because<00:03:51.370> if

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
whiff but I'll try it first because if

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.780 
whiff but I'll try it first because if
you<00:03:51.700> take<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.970> big<00:03:52.209> enough<00:03:52.450> hit<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.840> is

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
you take a big enough hit of that is

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.940 
you take a big enough hit of that is
very<00:03:54.790> kind<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.120> distracting<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:55.840> as<00:03:56.829> you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
very kind of distracting because as you

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.580 
very kind of distracting because as you
can<00:03:57.100> see<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.549> disorients<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.690> little<00:03:59.440> bit

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
can see it disorients you a little bit

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.440 
can see it disorients you a little bit
if<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.739> do<00:03:59.890> too<00:04:00.100> much<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.150> last<00:04:01.239> thing

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
if you do too much and the last thing

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.699 
if you do too much and the last thing
you<00:04:01.510> want<00:04:01.629> to<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.810> throw<00:04:01.930> something<00:04:02.379> new<00:04:02.590> in

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
you want to do is throw something new in

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.970 
you want to do is throw something new in
the<00:04:02.800> mix<00:04:03.010> when<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.430> go<00:04:03.550> to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
the mix when you go to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.280 
the mix when you go to
and<00:04:04.190> you're<00:04:04.550> stumbling<00:04:04.940> around<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:06.020> can't

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
and you're stumbling around you can't

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.160 
and you're stumbling around you can't
see<00:04:06.560> or<00:04:06.890> think<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.540> try<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.780> lift<00:04:08.989> like

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
see or think and you try to lift like

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.229 
see or think and you try to lift like
that<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:10.069> can<00:04:10.099> definitely<00:04:10.370> kind<00:04:11.180> of

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
that so they can definitely kind of

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.350 
that so they can definitely kind of
knock<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.540> off<00:04:11.569> your<00:04:11.690> feet<00:04:12.129> so<00:04:13.129> I<00:04:13.519> hope<00:04:13.790> that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
knock you off your feet so I hope that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.330 
knock you off your feet so I hope that
kind<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.930> gives<00:04:15.230> someone<00:04:15.500> idea<00:04:15.800> of<00:04:15.890> how<00:04:16.070> much

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
kind of gives someone idea of how much

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.190 
kind of gives someone idea of how much
stronger<00:04:16.700> than<00:04:16.970> those<00:04:17.180> torque<00:04:17.480> is<00:04:17.750> from

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
stronger than those torque is from

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.469 
stronger than those torque is from
pneumonia<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.519> actually<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:19.910> didn't<00:04:20.269> take

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
pneumonia and actually I didn't take

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.900 
pneumonia and actually I didn't take
that<00:04:20.840> huge<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.799> sniff<00:04:22.100> on<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.700> if<00:04:22.790> you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
that huge of a sniff on that so if you

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.400 
that huge of a sniff on that so if you
really<00:04:23.240> stick<00:04:23.479> your<00:04:23.630> nose<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:24.020> that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
really stick your nose in that

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.730 
really stick your nose in that
it's<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:26.030> hard<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:26.840> it's<00:04:27.229> only<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.590> new

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's it's hard so it's only of a new

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.370 
it's it's hard so it's only of a new
bottle<00:04:28.130> there's<00:04:28.370> more<00:04:29.330> than<00:04:29.570> enough<00:04:31.600> gusto<00:04:32.600> in

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
bottle there's more than enough gusto in

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.000 
bottle there's more than enough gusto in
that<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:33.979> hope<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:34.790> helps<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.150> guys<00:04:35.240> and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
that so hope that helps you guys and

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
that so hope that helps you guys and
I'll<00:04:37.010> see<00:04:37.220> if<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.340> can<00:04:37.490> put<00:04:37.610> up<00:04:37.639> some<00:04:37.880> more

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
I'll see if I can put up some more

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.680 
I'll see if I can put up some more
videos<00:04:38.770> on<00:04:39.770> certain<00:04:40.520> subjects<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.419> have

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
videos on certain subjects that have

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.100 
videos on certain subjects that have
been<00:04:41.990> asked<00:04:42.380> more<00:04:42.560> frequently
