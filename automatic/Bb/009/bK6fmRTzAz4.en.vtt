some<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> predictions<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.700> that<00:00:06.330> London

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
some of the predictions that that London

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.440 
some of the predictions that that London
faces<00:00:07.140> are<00:00:07.259> for<00:00:07.410> example<00:00:07.519> warmer<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.730> drier

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
faces are for example warmer and drier

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.470 
faces are for example warmer and drier
summers<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.340> whole<00:00:11.550> wetter<00:00:12.030> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
summers and on the whole wetter and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.919 
summers and on the whole wetter and
slightly<00:00:12.990> warmer<00:00:13.139> winters<00:00:14.509> well<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.780> new

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
slightly warmer winters well it's a new

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.050 
slightly warmer winters well it's a new
climate<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.560> London<00:00:17.100> it's<00:00:17.369> obviously<00:00:17.880> not

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
climate for London it's obviously not

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
climate for London it's obviously not
new<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.449> world<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.960> what's<00:00:19.109> exciting<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
new in the world and what's exciting is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.900 
new in the world and what's exciting is
that<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.130> start<00:00:20.340> looking<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.760> other

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that we can start looking at other

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.560 
that we can start looking at other
cities<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> world<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.769> example<00:00:23.570> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
cities in the world for example the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
cities in the world for example the
Mediterranean<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.619> regards<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> warm

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
Mediterranean with regards to warm

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
Mediterranean with regards to warm
summers<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.689> how<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> prevent<00:00:28.260> overheating

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
summers and how to prevent overheating

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.420 
summers and how to prevent overheating
and<00:00:29.630> safeguard<00:00:30.630> occupant<00:00:31.140> health<00:00:31.399> but<00:00:32.399> also

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and safeguard occupant health but also

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
and safeguard occupant health but also
then<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.940> example<00:00:33.000> Venice<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.920> Netherlands

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
then for example Venice and Netherlands

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.670 
then for example Venice and Netherlands
because<00:00:35.570> when<00:00:36.570> we're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.290> more

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
because when we're going to see more

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.369 
because when we're going to see more
winter<00:00:38.460> rain<00:00:38.820> were<00:00:39.719> likely<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.230> more

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
winter rain were likely to get more

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
winter rain were likely to get more
flash<00:00:40.620> floods<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.309> might<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> building<00:00:41.790> more

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
flash floods we might be building more

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990 
flash floods we might be building more
on<00:00:43.079> flood<00:00:43.410> plains<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.129> course<00:00:44.340> there<00:00:44.969> are

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
on flood plains and of course there are

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.729 
on flood plains and of course there are
cities<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.140> learned<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
cities that really have learned how to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.510 
cities that really have learned how to
work<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.280> water<00:00:47.550> rather<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:48.059> against<00:00:48.629> it

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
work with water rather than against it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.740 
work with water rather than against it
what's<00:00:50.520> interesting<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
what's interesting is that some of the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
what's interesting is that some of the
measures<00:00:52.079> are<00:00:52.230> help<00:00:52.410> overheating<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.160> green

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
measures are help overheating like green

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.689 
measures are help overheating like green
spaces<00:00:54.350> some<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.559> call<00:00:55.649> water<00:00:56.039> squares

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
spaces some what we call water squares

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.810 
spaces some what we call water squares
and<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.260> trees<00:00:58.620> they<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.039> help<00:00:59.489> prevent

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and and trees they also help prevent

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
and and trees they also help prevent
some<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.420> flash<00:01:00.719> flooding<00:01:01.050> while<00:01:01.739> they

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
some of that flash flooding while they

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
some of that flash flooding while they
also<00:01:02.070> provide<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.609> calling<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> some

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
also provide some calling and some

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
also provide some calling and some
amenities<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> residents<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> also

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
amenities for the residents and and also

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520 
amenities for the residents and and also
provides<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.240> healthy<00:01:06.450> living<00:01:07.229> work

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
provides a healthy living work

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.420 
provides a healthy living work
environment<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> city<00:01:11.840> some<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
environment in the city some of the

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.710 
environment in the city some of the
measures<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> were<00:01:14.729> looking<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.150> both<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
measures that were looking at both of a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
measures that were looking at both of a
city<00:01:16.259> scale<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> building

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
city scale as well as at a building

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.109 
city scale as well as at a building
scale<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.900> overheating<00:01:19.439> would<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.369> well

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
scale for overheating would be well

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
scale for overheating would be well
insulated<00:01:21.479> buildings<00:01:22.259> both<00:01:22.530> new<00:01:22.799> build<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
insulated buildings both new build and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
insulated buildings both new build and
also<00:01:23.729> retrofit<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> existing<00:01:25.049> building

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
also retrofit of the existing building

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
also retrofit of the existing building
stock<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.369> London<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
stock in London which is one of the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.429 
stock in London which is one of the
oldest<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.650> Europe<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.990> as

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
oldest in Europe actually and also as

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
oldest in Europe actually and also as
well<00:01:31.650> insulation<00:01:32.220> good<00:01:32.400> air<00:01:32.549> tightness

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
well insulation good air tightness

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.410 
well insulation good air tightness
because<00:01:33.540> these<00:01:33.720> measures<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.170> both<00:01:34.350> prevent

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
because these measures are both prevent

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.590 
because these measures are both prevent
overheating<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:37.409> summer<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.939> obviously<00:01:39.240> also

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
overheating in summer but obviously also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
overheating in summer but obviously also
keep<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> cold<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.530> winter<00:01:40.829> which<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.100> why

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
keep the cold out in winter which is why

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
keep the cold out in winter which is why
we're<00:01:41.400> currently<00:01:41.579> using<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:42.240> measures<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we're currently using these measures and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.560 
we're currently using these measures and
of<00:01:43.710> course<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.520> soon<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> insulate<00:01:45.299> really

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
of course as soon as you insulate really

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
of course as soon as you insulate really
well<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.110> safe<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> look<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.770> sort<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
well you're all safe to look at sort of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190 
well you're all safe to look at sort of
shading<00:01:47.579> having<00:01:48.299> effective<00:01:48.659> solar<00:01:48.899> shading

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
on all your buildings and at the same

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.210 
on all your buildings and at the same
time<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:51.899> providing<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.530> embroidered

time also providing for embroidered

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859 
time also providing for embroidered
opening<00:01:53.430> windows<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.119> night<00:01:54.299> cooling

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
opening windows for good night cooling

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.850 
opening windows for good night cooling
and<00:01:55.079> secure<00:01:55.409> ventilation<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> buildings

and secure ventilation of the buildings

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
and secure ventilation of the buildings
so<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> course<00:01:59.070> we've<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.610> got<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.970> be

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so of course we've also got to be

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
so of course we've also got to be
careful<00:02:00.300> about<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:01.020> we're<00:02:01.200> building<00:02:01.350> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
careful about when we're building and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.000 
careful about when we're building and
retrofitting<00:02:01.980> in<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.430> city<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.440> we<00:02:04.440> all

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
retrofitting in the city is that we all

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.260 
retrofitting in the city is that we all
the<00:02:05.160> buildings<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.550> very<00:02:05.580> close<00:02:05.970> together

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the buildings are very close together

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.020 
the buildings are very close together
and<00:02:07.130> while<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.250> might<00:02:08.490> want<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> reflect

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and while you might want to reflect

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
and while you might want to reflect
sunlight<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.720> prevent<00:02:09.990> overheating<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
sunlight to prevent overheating in a

sunlight to prevent overheating in a
building<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:12.120> issue<00:02:12.270> currently<00:02:12.780> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
building the issue currently is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.300 
building the issue currently is
particularly<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.350> corporate<00:02:13.860> office

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
particularly with corporate office

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.070 
particularly with corporate office
buildings<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.850> lot<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> them<00:02:15.240> are<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.450> glass<00:02:15.720> are

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
buildings a lot of them are in glass are

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.280 
buildings a lot of them are in glass are
in<00:02:16.200> steel<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.720> they<00:02:18.810> tend<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.050> reflect

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
in steel and so they tend to reflect

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
in steel and so they tend to reflect
lights<00:02:19.740> very<00:02:20.070> specifically<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.060> actually

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
lights very specifically and actually

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.140 
lights very specifically and actually
quite<00:02:21.810> strongly<00:02:22.140> down<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> ground<00:02:23.150> which

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
quite strongly down to the ground which

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.840 
quite strongly down to the ground which
then<00:02:24.300> combined<00:02:24.720> people<00:02:25.230> provide<00:02:26.070> glare<00:02:26.430> into

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
then combined people provide glare into

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.000 
then combined people provide glare into
other<00:02:27.000> spaces<00:02:27.420> across<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.020> road<00:02:28.230> for<00:02:28.500> example

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
other spaces across the road for example

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.850 
other spaces across the road for example
and<00:02:29.330> has<00:02:30.330> also<00:02:30.570> happened<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.260> London<00:02:31.410> lead

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and has also happened in London lead

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.800 
and has also happened in London lead
actually<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.490> started<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.060> damage

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
actually really started to damage

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.970 
actually really started to damage
property<00:02:34.110> on<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.489> ground<00:02:35.730> level<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.350> when

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
property on the ground level and so when

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
property on the ground level and so when
you're<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.400> looking<00:02:38.580> at<00:02:38.910> building

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you're really looking at building

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
you're really looking at building
sustainably<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.590> really<00:02:40.860> have<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.130> be<00:02:41.250> aware

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
sustainably you really have to be aware

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890 
sustainably you really have to be aware
of<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> surrounding<00:02:42.000> buildings<00:02:42.690> are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
of what the surrounding buildings are

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.290 
of what the surrounding buildings are
how<00:02:43.230> both<00:02:43.830> your<00:02:44.070> overshadowing<00:02:44.940> and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
how both your overshadowing and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.940 
how both your overshadowing and
impacting<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.020> but<00:02:46.230> equally<00:02:46.560> also<00:02:46.830> when

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
impacting them but equally also when

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.430 
impacting them but equally also when
you're<00:02:47.070> reflecting<00:02:47.610> light<00:02:47.850> back<00:02:48.209> how<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.290> is

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
you're reflecting light back how that is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.190 
you're reflecting light back how that is
impacting<00:02:50.010> them
