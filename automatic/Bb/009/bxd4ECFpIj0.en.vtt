00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.360
 achieving the bottom tourists that 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.820
 when he told me a little something but this one with 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.460
 the little man is just made of this recipe 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.790
 it's very very easy and make it rinse 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.550
 some clothes more potatoes in expenses that are 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.890
 raised are bleached about 45 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.300
 minutes in boiling water that when 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.250
 they are thermal that use actions 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.619
 little legs do not break in the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.690
 remove and cut cooking with water 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.430
 cool 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.410
 45 minutes sorry if you want to put a 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.410
 a little droplet of vinegar to the water 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.060
 It can be installed in a little water 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.680
 also always the potatoes 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 in water for a little bit of vinegar 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 withdrawals and cut the cooking and what 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.350
 we will do with this pope I like 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.350
 the chicken with potatoes 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 I really like the one that does not cry 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.959
 on that flight I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.450
 olive oil and what it does is very 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.150
 easy to pass the potato for olive oil 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.610
 and on Saturdays songs that I have here 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.430
 abundant and that should make a weight a 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.890
 hard text the magazines confess but 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.959
 look how easy it is to squeeze a little 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.720
 some potato is precocious the potato is 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.900
 skinny precocity we are going to put a 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.180
 little olive oil this plate 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.520
 well strong oven obviously the potato already 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.910
 has a cool option and you place these 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.020
 potatoes some golden potatoes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.000
 validity you have to return in peace 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.000
 then it is a good base 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.560
 but here all in love we do not go for 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.569
 here so that it looks good 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.040
 talk a little bit so what for 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.290
 that they criticize me so that it is not 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.700
 Christian but you are a person to 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.980
 that they say even 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.680
 I do not know what the oil takes where 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.280
 there were and these things well 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.140
 they always go to look for the hair to the egg 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.290
 we are one step further but we would not do 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.290
 nothing 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.879
 yes 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.530
 missing a date at liberty two points 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.220
 up more first first then to the champion the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.220
 week that we are going to take 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.769
 the face arrives 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.450
 We have to wait while we wait for the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.240
 river party sign that in the week 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.520
 I say it has whiskers that always 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.540
 cooked the raisins for olive oil and 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.850
 the roses 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.090
 with abundant that if we take the insurance 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.690
 always with love all things that you do 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.740
 the same 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.740
 who you like the least 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.690
 then the overflow with that cited by the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.850
 Something they said to me but we liked it 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.460
 It makes a lot of sense that it overflows 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.720
 quietly white with oil furnace 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.740
 very strong was also a few minutes 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.890
 making the view kidnap I'm going to 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.930
 show when we start we have a 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.970
 program because the fact something that started 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.340
 the week of the mozzarella then juan 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.680
 bracelli with a guest every day a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.400
 foreign guest in this case gerardo 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.020
 from Spain to have that tile 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.700
 incredible in an omelet like to the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.700
 Spanish but covered with mozzarella 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.940
 well it's a show so if 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.500
 you did not do the opposite we are seeing 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.500
 as workers talking 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.830
 now if we continue with this pulse of the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.830
 lacquer this
