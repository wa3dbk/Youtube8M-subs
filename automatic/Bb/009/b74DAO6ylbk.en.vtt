 true but I think it 's a lie not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.789
 I'm trusting the circuit very well. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.710
 No, but I found it very interesting. 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 series something like a legend to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.500
 hell brain beauty then there 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.629
 minecraft everyone who knew him played 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 minecraft but to download it was 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 need to pay on credit card 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.870
 and since my family and I are poor 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 We do not have credit cards or money. 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 to spend nonsense then from time to time 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 when I was the money and I was in 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 lan house play one day I was so 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 eager to play had joined 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.039
 money paying for the house but when 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 I arrived at the place he had caught fire. 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.700
 mysteriously and how it was a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.159
 very small town the only one in the house 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 was it so I decided that all 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.240
 money that I could make I would 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 save and join in order to buy a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 computer long after I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 I managed to save a thousand reais and it was 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.470
 bazaar buy a computer already used a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.930
 bit old when I got home 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 first thing I did was install the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 Unfortunately I tried several minecraft 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.729
 and several times and I could not just 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.710
 get more and more viruses then enter 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 a forum about minecraft and I asked 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 if anyone would like to understand the game 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 Just when I did the thigh 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.259
 a user's response appears 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.810
 called minecraft game and left a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.520
 message to call my phone 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 so I ran to the pay phone 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 I called the phone and for an instant 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 nobody answered me 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.439
 I could only hear a breath 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.909
 heavy but then a hoarse voice told me 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.350
 behind you 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.420
 when I put the phone on the hook and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.640
 I turned around without understanding what 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.979
 had happened there was a small box 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 of wood behind me so I took it and 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.670
 I took it home when I opened the box 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 there was a stern of him and a ticket 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.560
 written by minecraft kan for lucas 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.860
 I was a bit scared because in any case 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.300
 moment had to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.160
 I put the cd in my 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.490
 computer and open an application called 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 minecraft point these execute the file 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.170
 and when he opened it already had a name and a 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.550
 user as well as the user was 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.800
 minecraft under league and password was 66 min 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.100
 so there was an open world called help 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.020
 me 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.850
 ignorei creates a new world and I played 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 I was very excited because finally 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.270
 I had the game and my computer. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.430
 after several days playing in my 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.709
 world I was curious to know how it was 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.970
 the other player's world its conditions 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 and your items 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.800
 then called a help call when 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.720
 values ​​are loaded but there were several 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.420
 flowers and plants around 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.160
 It turns out that everything was dry and part of the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.650
 brand was on fire instead of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.260
 animals that are always there like sheep 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.970
 then they were all dead 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.410
 I was scared even some kind of 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.590
 radio to the game when you open the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.420
 inventory had 60,000 animal bones 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.459
 I was a little surprised at how much 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.290
 animals that this guy had killed in the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.360
 inventory there was also a pickaxe 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.850
 tape of some kind of use I thought it was 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.019
 a rack or some river stripecke rumor 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.090
 when I looked at my character 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.010
 I realized he was full of wounds 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.750
 and I had no eyes or mouth I found everything 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.790
 that's very strange but I decided 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.470
 continue my first step of one 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.989
 written dialog box 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 help me please, then I typed who 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 It's you and no one answered then. 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.380
 I keep walking around the map exploring 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.090
 then again a buffer the notebooks 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.340
 Pedro help me please 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.380
 so I typed where you are and 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.880
 No one answered me again here. 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.430
 it limited a little that touched me 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.799
 but I kept walking around the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.560
 until you find a dark cave like the 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.450
 written plaque happy place and when I 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.390
 I entered inside this cave appeared 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.190
 ultra written dialogue box are you 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.489
 close and I said ok 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.989
 I went into the cave and went exploring 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.870
 until you find a red light 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.180
 symbol from within one then I broke 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.890
 this cube and inside there was a cell 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.200
 similar to prisoners 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.720
 there was a plate and food on the floor and 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.060
 very much blood spread then 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.040
 again an April written dialogue you 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.770
 Found me this time, I did not write anything. 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.030
 When I got near the cell I saw something. 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.770
 written with blood on the wall 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.360
 A mother had written soon when 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.310
 I finished to read, my father was crying. 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.700
 at home with the blood of your arms 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.380
 screaming inexplicably then 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.910
 I asked what had happened and he 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.010
 told me that my mother had been 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.139
 murdered and was found inside 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.639
 a cave that was close to home 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.470
 When I found out, I was running. 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.840
 to the place when I got there was a 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.130
 inside the cave with the plate and 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.860
 a lot of blood on the floor 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.139
 the place reminded me a lot of game because it was 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.970
 so I found a cave with 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.010
 dish and neither blood 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.750
 I came home very nervous looking 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.940
 then reopen the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.669
 world and went to the cave is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.669
 inscribed on the wall inside the cave in 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.480
 Mother's Day was written to you. 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.180
 I was very scared so hello 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.700
 I am Lucas's father. I write to 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.500
 inform that he is gone and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020
 anyone who has information of 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.040
 Where is he letting me know? 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.860
 search for him 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.160
 he left a single written note 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.200
 Minecraft, that's it then, I hope 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.030
 You liked it, man. I liked it. 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.010
 shiver and morale at the very end 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.040
 here when it was written instead of mother 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.530
 It was written to you, I shudder and in morale. 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.080
 dating but in three states have 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.360

 the favorite already help me a lot if you guys 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.770
 It is logical that I can look for 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.690
 four more cups like this or even 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.820
 better than this and bring the channel 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.490
 because seriously I think so fucking those 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.260
 things like asking if of Pokemon of 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.210
 several other things that story of the 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.010
 West in coma mano I think a lot in 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.080
 so if you want then I can 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.630
 to continue if you do not want to speak 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.700
 so for ugly package I do not want to 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.520
 It 's beauty, that's it 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.520
 I hope you like a suite
