six right there I'm gonna kinda you put
it<00:02:17.180> ended<00:02:18.180> irate<00:02:18.540> about<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.470> past<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it ended irate about a little past I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.150 
it ended irate about a little past I
think<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:21.840> right<00:02:22.110> about<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.410> second<00:02:22.710> hash<00:02:22.860> on

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
think I'm right about the second hash on

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.300 
think I'm right about the second hash on
the<00:02:23.640> y-axis<00:02:24.120> negative<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.350> because<00:02:26.100> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the y-axis negative two because you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.520 
the y-axis negative two because you
could<00:02:26.460> say<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.080> number<00:02:28.080> seven<00:02:28.530> um<00:02:30.170> that's<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
could say and number seven um that's the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.310 
could say and number seven um that's the
other<00:02:31.740> side<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:33.360> other<00:02:33.510> hand<00:02:33.780> side<00:02:34.020> right

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
other side the other hand side right

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.000 
other side the other hand side right
about<00:02:34.530> there

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
about there

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.290 
about there
um<00:02:36.920> yeah<00:02:37.920> make<00:02:38.250> sure<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.490> fits<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.880> there<00:02:39.060> nice

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
um yeah make sure it fits in there nice

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.260 
um yeah make sure it fits in there nice
perfect<00:02:39.900> make<00:02:40.140> sure<00:02:40.290> everything's<00:02:41.270> parallel

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
perfect make sure everything's parallel

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.010 
perfect make sure everything's parallel
and<00:02:43.520> mirror<00:02:44.520> reflecting<00:02:45.770> um<00:02:46.770> now<00:02:47.390> eight<00:02:48.390> nine

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and mirror reflecting um now eight nine

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.600 
and mirror reflecting um now eight nine
or<00:02:49.050> seven<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.950> eight<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.100> don't<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.460> which

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
or seven and eight I don't know which

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.280 
or seven and eight I don't know which
ones<00:02:50.790> was<00:02:50.970> uh<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.330> think<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.960> eight<00:02:52.050> nine

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
ones was uh I think it's eight nine

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.390 
ones was uh I think it's eight nine
those<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:55.260> two<00:02:55.500> opposite<00:02:56.040> sides<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
those are the two opposite sides I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.530 
those are the two opposite sides I
figure<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.700> didn't<00:02:56.910> need<00:02:56.970> how<00:02:57.150> much<00:02:57.270> help

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
figure you didn't need how much help

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
figure you didn't need how much help
with<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:58.980> I'm<00:02:59.130> getting<00:02:59.400> way<00:02:59.580> too

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
with that all that I'm getting way too

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.490 
with that all that I'm getting way too
behind<00:03:00.330> right<00:03:01.050> now

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
behind right now

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.490 
behind right now
make<00:03:01.950> sure<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.370> bottom<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.240> M<00:03:03.510> doesn't

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.710 

doesn't<00:03:07.500> touch<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.070> G<00:03:08.370> now<00:03:09.150> we're<00:03:09.330> moving<00:03:09.570> on

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
doesn't touch the G now we're moving on

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.530 
doesn't touch the G now we're moving on
to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.960> G<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.530> G<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.280> arc<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:12.300> get

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
to the G the G is just this arc you get

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.600 
to the G the G is just this arc you get
the<00:03:12.690> arc<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.200> make<00:03:13.410> that<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> top<00:03:13.920> make<00:03:14.580> sure

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
the arc you make that the top make sure

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.530 
the arc you make that the top make sure
it<00:03:14.880> touches<00:03:15.450> all<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:16.410> mean<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:18.150> touches

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
it touches all I mean it touches

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.760 
it touches all I mean it touches
everything<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.100> area<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.090> little

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
everything in the area but that little

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.790 
everything in the area but that little
cross<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.100> bottom<00:03:23.910> M<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.260> G

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
cross the bottom M there so that's the G

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800 
cross the bottom M there so that's the G
top<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.250> G<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:27.240> we're<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.540> move<00:03:27.660> on

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
top of the G now we're going to move on

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.540 
top of the G now we're going to move on
to<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.020> bottom<00:03:28.560> or<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.120> little<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.860> cross

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
like it was a G and it never was a two

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.490 
like it was a G and it never was a two
little<00:04:04.340> arcs<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.940> then<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.480> little<00:04:07.489> circle

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
little arcs and then a little circle

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.880 
little arcs and then a little circle
because<00:04:10.500> that'd<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.800> stupid<00:04:11.780> anyway<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:13.470> kind

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890
