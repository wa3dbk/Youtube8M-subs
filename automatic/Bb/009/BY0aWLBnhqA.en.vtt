instead<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.200> butter<00:02:25.459> because<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.610> works<00:02:26.820> great

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
instead of butter because it works great

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.460 
instead of butter because it works great
with<00:02:27.209> baking<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.900> cooking<00:02:28.050> at<00:02:28.320> high

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
temperatures and again it's cholesterol

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080 
temperatures and again it's cholesterol
free<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.560> has<00:02:31.590> ketones<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:32.459> help<00:02:32.760> feed

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
free and it has ketones which help feed

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.120

that feed our brains and keep us healthy

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.850 
that feed our brains and keep us healthy
now<00:02:38.010> instead<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.459> sugar<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.209> am<00:02:39.570> gonna<00:02:39.750> use<00:02:40.260> it's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
now instead of sugar I am gonna use it's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.790 
now instead of sugar I am gonna use it's
a<00:02:41.130> stevia<00:02:41.790> sugar<00:02:41.900> baking<00:02:42.900> combination<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
a stevia sugar baking combination it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.310 
a stevia sugar baking combination it
helps<00:02:44.370> things<00:02:44.640> bake<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> regular

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
helps things bake with the regular

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.020 
helps things bake with the regular
consistency<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.250> would<00:02:47.370> expect<00:02:47.760> it's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
consistency that you would expect it's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.970 
consistency that you would expect it's
going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.270> taste<00:02:48.480> almost<00:02:48.870> identical<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> using

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
going to taste almost identical to using

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.699 
going to taste almost identical to using
sugar<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:50.970> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.239> take<00:02:51.480> 2/3<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
sugar but it is going to take 2/3 of the

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.520 
sugar but it is going to take 2/3 of the
calories<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.540> sugar<00:02:54.750> calories<00:02:55.019> out<00:02:55.380> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
calories out the sugar calories out of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.920 
calories out the sugar calories out of
your<00:02:55.650> recipe<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.190> you're<00:02:56.310> only<00:02:56.760> getting<00:02:57.150> 1/3

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
your recipe so you're only getting 1/3

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
your recipe so you're only getting 1/3
of<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.140> calories<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.830> would<00:02:59.070> if<00:02:59.310> you

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
of the calories that you would if you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.580 
of the calories that you would if you
were<00:02:59.820> using<00:02:59.850> regular<00:03:00.810> sugar<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.320> that's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
were using regular sugar and that's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.630 
were using regular sugar and that's
awesome

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
