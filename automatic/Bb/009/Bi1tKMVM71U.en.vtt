00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.719
 say hello 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.519
 I am yesterday from gamer tv and like all 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.140
 weeks we are bringing you the best 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.570
 content of the whole industry 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.270
 videogames and this time it's my turn 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.880
 show them docter and master this review 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.189
 of a remake of a classic capcom 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.200
 developed by wayforward let's see the 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.880
 adventures the legs adventures of the uncle 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.980
 rich and enjoy many adventures there in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.530
 duckling with the bad guys and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.810
 also the good ones why when he does 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.700
 more than 20 years adapted to the first 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.490
 nintendo the television series 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.590
 starring the rich boy mcpato the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.890
 result was very fun and memorable 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.990
 why when capcom and wave for world 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.180
 they announced that they would work again 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.450
 docters in high definition 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.090
 the expectations went to heaven the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 mission is not simple because personal 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.980
 as keiji inafune the creator of megaman 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 participated in the construction of this 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.590
 classic lost himself instead of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.210
 just recover the original pixels and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 give him a little cat 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.850
 the graphic section is reconstructed 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.610
 therefore maintaining the essence was a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.979
 fundamental aspect as in the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.750
 8 bit version we have a game of 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.640
 platforms that differs from others 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.190
 similar for their tendency to 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.979
 exploration the treasure hunt and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.259
 pieces to complete the levels well 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.140
 as their particular game mechanics 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.360
 they are all here with the same 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.149
 advantages and disadvantages that in your delivery 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.490
 of origin so we still have that 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.580
 defeat the enemies by pressing a 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.009
 button and down the veterans will not have 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.350
 no conflict in doing it but for 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.360
 many new players adapt to 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.170
 command and execute it in the moment 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 precise will be a mess besides the physics of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.119
 the jumps and the movement is almost 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.159
 traced from the 8-bit edition so 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.500
 that if you are very fussy and the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 compare with current games maybe you 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 Looks like you're losing 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 the levels continue to maintain the design 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.810
 that made them popular with details like 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.360
 adding a faithful visual style to the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.610
 caricature on enemies and characters 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 great dangers to overcome and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.590
 Dodge pursuers do each 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.240
 screen as they did yesterday giving it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 a challenge that gets complicated with the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.459
 controls already mentioned but of course 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.520
 nobody takes a good visit to the mines 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.250
 Africans to the Himalayas and even the moon 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.320
 sometimes leaves a bit to be desired the 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.140
 graphic section since it is 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.959
 inconsistent and for many it breaks with the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.150
 retro charm likewise although the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.510
 sprites of characters like the rich uncle 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.390
 hugo to luis or if it operates crazy are 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.459
 very beautiful it takes away that for many 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.730
 it would have been better to have them too 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.340
 in three of those and you're going to miss the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.739
 dubbing and Latin subtitles but 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 the voices in English are the original 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.319
 If you want a game that looks too 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.970
 like the current ones and play the same 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.489
 it's definitely not your title 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.159
 preserves the essence for good and for evil 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.890
 of the original fire if what you need 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.680
 is to resurrect those old times with a 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.970
 new perspective do not hesitate to throw a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.970
 eye to the pacts
