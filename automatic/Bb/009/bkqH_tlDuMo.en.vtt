00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
it has been a huge change not only with

it has been a huge change not only with
the<00:00:10.670> amount<00:00:10.880> of<00:00:10.940> people<00:00:11.120> that<00:00:11.269> are<00:00:11.420> using<00:00:11.450> the

upstream<00:00:15.970> before<00:00:16.970> we<00:00:17.180> would<00:00:17.300> see<00:00:17.570> a<00:00:17.600> lot<00:00:17.960> of

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
upstream before we would see a lot of

upstream before we would see a lot of
the<00:00:18.170> fish<00:00:18.439> being<00:00:19.039> stopped<00:00:19.760> right<00:00:20.600> before<00:00:20.930> the

bridge and a little bit sooner because
there<00:00:24.380> are<00:00:24.439> now<00:00:24.590> riffles<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.099> pools<00:00:25.400> in<00:00:25.760> the

concrete<00:00:37.460> section<00:00:38.120> we<00:00:38.300> also<00:00:38.480> took<00:00:39.110> out<00:00:39.290> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
concrete section we also took out the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.920 
concrete section we also took out the
concrete<00:00:39.890> from<00:00:40.010> 6<00:00:40.309> feet<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.730> 94<00:00:41.270> having<00:00:41.719> that

that new portion of the 6th Street
bridge<00:00:44.020> completed<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:45.980> great<00:00:46.250> place<00:00:46.430> to

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
bridge completed is a great place to

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.459 
bridge completed is a great place to
point<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.090> as<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.270> tangible<00:00:47.750> result<00:00:48.289> this<00:00:48.410> is

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
point to as a tangible result this is

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.500 
point to as a tangible result this is
what<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.219> entire<00:00:49.340> corridor<00:00:50.030> will<00:00:50.180> look<00:00:50.329> like

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
what the entire corridor will look like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.180 
what the entire corridor will look like
and<00:00:50.809> this<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.320> what<00:00:51.500> we're<00:00:51.770> really<00:00:51.890> working

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
and this is what we're really working

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.189 
and this is what we're really working
towards<00:00:52.640> at<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.090> long<00:00:53.270> term<00:00:53.539> vision<00:00:53.899> well

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
towards at the long term vision well

towards at the long term vision well
what<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:54.440> have<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.949> concrete<00:00:55.430> line

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
what we have now is a concrete line

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.060 
what we have now is a concrete line
channel<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.210> was<00:00:56.390> used<00:00:56.660> as<00:00:56.840> an<00:00:56.989> older<00:00:57.590> style

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
channel that was used as an older style

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.799 
channel that was used as an older style
of<00:00:58.370> flood<00:00:58.579> management<00:00:58.789> which<00:00:59.270> is<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.570> convey

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
of flood management which is to convey

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
what we're going to do is remove the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.120 
what we're going to do is remove the
concrete<00:01:06.480> we're<00:01:06.870> gonna<00:01:06.990> widen<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.680> channel

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
concrete we're gonna widen this channel

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.040 
concrete we're gonna widen this channel
we're<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.910> it<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> pool<00:01:09.540> riffle

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
we're gonna make it into a pool riffle

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.350 
we're gonna make it into a pool riffle
system<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> fish<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.730> actually<00:01:11.760> rest

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
system where the fish can actually rest

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.150 
system where the fish can actually rest
in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> pools<00:01:12.870> move<00:01:13.350> through<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> riffles

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
in the pools move through the riffles

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.100 
in the pools move through the riffles
into<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.550> pool<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.120> move<00:01:15.570> their<00:01:15.750> way<00:01:15.870> all<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
into a pool and move their way all the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.840 
into a pool and move their way all the
way<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.380> twenty-seven<00:01:16.980> Street<00:01:17.220> something

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
way up to twenty-seven Street something

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
way up to twenty-seven Street something
that<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.210> gorgeous<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.170> natural-looking<00:01:19.710> but

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
that is gorgeous and natural-looking but

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
that is gorgeous and natural-looking but
also<00:01:20.220> serves<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:21.060> purpose<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.720> natural

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
also serves a purpose as a natural

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
also serves a purpose as a natural
resource<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.640> than<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
resource so it's more than just

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.400 
resource so it's more than just
improving<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.510> river<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.870> more<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.200> just

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
improving the river it's more than just

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.740 
improving the river it's more than just
removing<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> concrete<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.030> transforming

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
removing the concrete it's transforming

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.360 
removing the concrete it's transforming
the<00:01:27.840> neighborhood<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.130 
the neighborhood and this kind of
investment<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.120> really<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.600> change<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
investment can really really change the
