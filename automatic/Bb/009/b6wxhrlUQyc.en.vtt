another<00:00:28.859> way<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.429> would<00:00:29.609> suggest<00:00:29.820> we've

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
another way that we would suggest we've

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.319 
another way that we would suggest we've
had<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> few<00:00:31.230> customer<00:00:31.679> concerns<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> way

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
had a few customer concerns with the way

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
had a few customer concerns with the way
it<00:00:33.510> came<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.290> wires<00:00:34.590> getting

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
it came with of the wires getting

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
it came with of the wires getting
twisted<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> potentially<00:00:36.630> causing

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
twisted up and potentially causing

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.450 
twisted up and potentially causing
problems<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.920> another<00:00:38.190> way<00:00:38.399> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
buffer tube but what you don't want to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
buffer tube but what you don't want to
do<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> battery<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.320> buffer

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
do is have the battery in the buffer

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.620 
do is have the battery in the buffer
tube<00:01:23.009> while<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.490> spinning<00:01:23.640> where<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.509> we

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
tube while it's spinning where if we

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.440 
tube while it's spinning where if we
start<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> battery<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.409> now<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> start

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
start the battery in here now and start

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.609 
start the battery in here now and start
twisting<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> buffer<00:01:27.810> tube<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> putting<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
twisting the buffer tube and putting it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
twisting the buffer tube and putting it
back<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> gun<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.520> battery<00:01:29.970> stuff<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
back on the gun the battery stuff is

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
back on the gun the battery stuff is
gonna<00:01:30.570> twist<00:01:30.960> as<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.189> gonna<00:01:32.310> twist

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
gonna twist as well and it's gonna twist

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
gonna twist as well and it's gonna twist
up<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> bunch<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> wires<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.659> where<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
up a bunch of wires and that's where you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.880 
up a bunch of wires and that's where you
can<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.290> problems<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.740> I'm<00:01:34.799> gonna

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can have some problems so what I'm gonna

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
can have some problems so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.159> leave<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> battery<00:01:35.610> expose<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.299> here

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
do is leave the battery expose out here

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
do is leave the battery expose out here
so<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> hold<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.070> gonna

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so I can hold on to it so it's not gonna

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.399 
so I can hold on to it so it's not gonna
twist<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.390> twist<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> buffer<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
twist and then twist the buffer to on

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.050 
twist and then twist the buffer to on
separately

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.160 

so<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.150> can<00:01:50.300> see<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:50.600> I'm<00:01:50.720> actually<00:01:50.870> putting

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
so you can see now I'm actually putting

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.720 
so you can see now I'm actually putting
the<00:01:51.290> buffer<00:01:51.530> tube<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:52.220> threading<00:01:52.610> on

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
the buffer tube on and it's threading on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.100 
the buffer tube on and it's threading on
the<00:01:52.850> back<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.210> receiver<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:53.960> this

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the back of the receiver but this

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.020 
the back of the receiver but this
battery<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.530> not<00:01:54.830> moving<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.820> wires

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
battery is not moving so the wires

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.360 
battery is not moving so the wires
inside<00:01:56.270> are<00:01:56.750> staying<00:01:57.080> straight<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.860> not

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
inside are staying straight and not

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.070 
inside are staying straight and not
getting<00:01:58.610> twisted<00:01:58.910> up<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.300> not<00:01:59.450> causing<00:01:59.750> any

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
getting twisted up and not causing any

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.280 
getting twisted up and not causing any
problems<00:02:05.110> once<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.770> good<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.310> tight

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
problems once that is on good and tight

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.419 
problems once that is on good and tight
what<00:02:09.290> you're<00:02:09.410> going<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.590> do<00:02:09.740> is<00:02:09.920> put<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
what you're going to do is put the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.300 
what you're going to do is put the
battery<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.320> be<00:02:12.320> gentle<00:02:12.650> because<00:02:12.950> what's

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
battery and be gentle because what's

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.800 
battery and be gentle because what's
happening<00:02:13.610> inside<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.209> battery<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
happening inside is the battery or the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
happening inside is the battery or the
wires<00:02:14.990> are<00:02:15.170> kind<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.380> folding<00:02:15.740> within<00:02:16.040> itself

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
wires are kind of folding within itself

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
wires are kind of folding within itself
so<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:16.970> want<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.360> kind<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:17.900> feel<00:02:18.260> around

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
so you want to kind of just feel around

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.380 
so you want to kind of just feel around
for<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.580> battery<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
for it and get the battery in there and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
for it and get the battery in there and
then<00:02:23.510> you're<00:02:23.630> going<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> close<00:02:24.050> up<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> end

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
then you're going to close up the end

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.220 
then you're going to close up the end
cap<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:29.209> way<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.630> little<00:02:29.989> bit

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
cap and so this way is a little bit

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.780 
cap and so this way is a little bit
safer<00:02:30.650> where<00:02:30.920> you're<00:02:31.100> not<00:02:31.220> going<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.640> any

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
safer where you're not going to have any

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
safer where you're not going to have any
problems<00:02:32.209> with<00:02:32.360> those<00:02:32.510> wires<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> better<00:02:33.440> get

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
problems with those wires and better get

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.630 
problems with those wires and better get
twist<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:35.150> you're<00:02:35.300> good<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> go<00:02:36.640> alright

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
twist that and you're good to go alright

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.979 
twist that and you're good to go alright
so<00:02:37.760> that's<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.090> way<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.540> suggest

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
so that's the way that we suggest

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.080 
so that's the way that we suggest
installing<00:02:39.320> your<00:02:39.530> battery<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:40.100> your<00:02:40.130> new<00:02:40.489> GMG

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
installing your battery on your new GMG

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.910 
installing your battery on your new GMG
