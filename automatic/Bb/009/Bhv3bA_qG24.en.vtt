their<00:00:18.539> brains<00:00:18.779> grow<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.890> develop<00:00:20.070> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
their brains grow and develop but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420 
their brains grow and develop but
through<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> years<00:00:21.210> from<00:00:21.390> wood<00:00:21.750> age<00:00:22.039> from<00:00:23.039> 3

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
through the years from wood age from 3

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660 
through the years from wood age from 3
and<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:24.449> 5<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.800> eager<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.519> look

and from 5 I'm really eager to look

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
and from 5 I'm really eager to look
inside<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.269> brain<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> gonna<00:00:28.289> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
inside your brain is one of you gonna be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.589 
inside your brain is one of you gonna be
able<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> show<00:00:29.460> us<00:00:29.609> your<00:00:29.760> brain<00:00:29.970> today<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.359> guess

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
able to show us your brain today I guess

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.530 
able to show us your brain today I guess
I<00:00:31.260> will<00:00:31.560> okay<00:00:32.070> great<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.910> let's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
take a look and put them in the scanner

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.220 
take a look and put them in the scanner
that'll<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.370> great

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.439 
picture of how the makeup of a young
brain<00:00:48.239> changes<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> matures<00:00:49.969> can<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> show

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
brain changes as it matures can you show

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
brain changes as it matures can you show
me<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.559> changed<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> Jordan's<00:00:53.670> brain

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
me how that changed in Jordan's brain

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.439 
me how that changed in Jordan's brain
over<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> years<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:56.160> from<00:00:56.489> photograph

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
over the years we can from photograph

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.560 
over the years we can from photograph
give<00:00:57.629> me<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.899> scan<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> long<00:00:59.579> time<00:00:59.910> though<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
give me a scan for a long time though so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
give me a scan for a long time though so
this<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.219> ages<00:01:02.550> he<00:01:02.670> started<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this is what what ages he started so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.560 
this is what what ages he started so
this<00:01:03.899> um<00:01:04.199> needle<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> port<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.549> goes<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.150> from

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
this um needle it port it goes on from

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.840 
this um needle it port it goes on from
ages<00:01:07.049> 3<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.680> 25<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.659> actually<00:01:10.049> combining

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
ages 3 to 25 and it's actually combining

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
ages 3 to 25 and it's actually combining
people<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.119> across<00:01:12.930> different<00:01:13.380> tongues<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
people of across different tongues in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
people of across different tongues in
nitrus<00:01:14.310> Jordan<00:01:14.760> right<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
nitrus Jordan right but it's actually a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469 
nitrus Jordan right but it's actually a
part<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> our<00:01:17.040> art<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.000> memory

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
part of it our art is actually a memory

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.800 
part of it our art is actually a memory
in<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.729> what<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> these

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
in this one and what we see in these

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.609 
in this one and what we see in these
colors<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.590> blue<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.210> seen<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.840> maturation

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
colors is blue can be seen as maturation

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.710 
colors is blue can be seen as maturation
in<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.280> sense<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.580> getting<00:01:26.790> closer<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
in the sense it's getting closer to the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
in the sense it's getting closer to the
adult<00:01:28.020> brain<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.210> when<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> draw

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
adult brain and when I'm going to draw

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
adult brain and when I'm going to draw
your<00:01:30.810> attention<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.950> part<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
your attention to is this part of the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.050 
your attention to is this part of the
brain<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:33.920> here<00:01:34.920> yeah<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.759> turns

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
brain right here here yeah that turns

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.170 
brain right here here yeah that turns
the<00:01:36.570> last<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.079> turn<00:01:37.290> blue<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the last to turn blue right and this is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.280 
the last to turn blue right and this is
a<00:01:39.210> part<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> brain<00:01:39.960> called<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
a part of the brain called the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.240 
a part of the brain called the
prefrontal<00:01:40.470> cortex<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.880> involved<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
prefrontal cortex and involved in

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.389 
prefrontal cortex and involved in
impulse<00:01:44.250> control<00:01:45.170> long-range<00:01:46.170> planning<00:01:46.560> the

kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> hard<00:01:47.939> stuff<00:01:48.000> integrating

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
kind of the hard stuff integrating

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.510 
kind of the hard stuff integrating
everything<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> part

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
everything to make that is it a part

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
everything to make that is it a part
that<00:01:50.579> should<00:01:50.880> come<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.560> maturation

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
that should come in first the maturation

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.310 
that should come in first the maturation
of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.520> adolescent<00:01:54.270> brain<00:01:54.329> involves<00:01:55.200> the

of the adolescent brain involves the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
of the adolescent brain involves the
pruning<00:01:55.710> away<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.280> its<00:01:56.460> gray<00:01:56.759> matter<00:01:57.090> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
join in now where would I should be

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.300 
join in now where would I should be
along<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.380> you're<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.740> couple

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
along this is actually you're a couple

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.880 
along this is actually you're a couple
years<00:02:32.520> old<00:02:32.670> 19<00:02:33.420> 2<00:02:33.660> years<00:02:33.810> older<00:02:34.080> yeah<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.740> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
years old 19 2 years older yeah so that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.610 
years old 19 2 years older yeah so that
exactly<00:02:35.610> two<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> half<00:02:36.120> years<00:02:36.360> apart<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
exactly two and a half years apart the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.750 
exactly two and a half years apart the
twist<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.280> though<00:02:38.489> is<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.380> females

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
twist on this though is that females

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.310 
twist on this though is that females
tend<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.970> hit<00:02:42.120> these<00:02:42.270> Peaks<00:02:42.630> about<00:02:42.930> two<00:02:43.170> years

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
tend to hit these Peaks about two years

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.670 
tend to hit these Peaks about two years
earlier<00:02:43.739> than<00:02:44.280> males<00:02:44.550> as<00:02:44.760> well<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.870> Sasha

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
earlier than males as well so for Sasha

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.990 
earlier than males as well so for Sasha
we<00:02:47.100> need<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.970> go<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.920> little<00:02:49.920> bit<00:02:50.160> further<00:02:50.459> than

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
we need to go a little bit further than

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.320 
we need to go a little bit further than
two<00:02:51.239> years<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.610> still<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.120> little

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
two years and so we still see a little

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.750 
two years and so we still see a little
bit<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:56.000> non<00:02:57.000> blue<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:58.410> these<00:02:58.560> areas<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.580> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
bit of of non blue in these areas but it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640 
bit of of non blue in these areas but it
is<00:02:59.910> farther<00:03:00.360> along<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.350> sure<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
is farther along it's not sure do you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.350 
is farther along it's not sure do you
have<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.040> picture<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.550> your<00:03:02.700> facebook<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:05.610> can

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
have this picture on your facebook I can

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.350 
have this picture on your facebook I can
get<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.540> lot<00:03:06.750> already<00:03:07.640> but<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.850> interesting

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
get a lot already but it is interesting

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.750 
get a lot already but it is interesting
as<00:03:09.510> well<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.930> these<00:03:10.380> are<00:03:10.530> averages<00:03:11.040> yeah

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
as well that these are averages yeah

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.479 
as well that these are averages yeah
and<00:03:12.090> both<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.810> brain<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> behavior<00:03:14.070> we

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
and both in brain and the behavior we

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.090 
and both in brain and the behavior we
see<00:03:14.700> some<00:03:14.940> young<00:03:15.840> people<00:03:16.200> about<00:03:16.440> 34<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.980> are

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
see some young people about 34 that are

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.400 
see some young people about 34 that are
very<00:03:17.370> responsible<00:03:17.940> not<00:03:18.299> impulsive<00:03:18.660> make<00:03:19.170> good

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
very responsible not impulsive make good

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.340 
very responsible not impulsive make good
decisions<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.160> we<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.670> people<00:03:21.290> our<00:03:22.290> age

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
decisions and we see people our age

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.000 
decisions and we see people our age
older<00:03:22.860> who<00:03:22.980> never<00:03:23.640> pick<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:23.940> up
