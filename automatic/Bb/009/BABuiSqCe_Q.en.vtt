on top of it see if this is right that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.580 
on top of it see if this is right that
up<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:24.080> need<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.290> be<00:03:24.380> like<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:25.300> upside<00:03:26.300> down

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
up you need to be like this upside down

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.320 
up you need to be like this upside down
and<00:03:27.590> make<00:03:27.890> sure<00:03:27.920> again<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.550> it<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.120> perfectly

and make sure again that it is perfectly

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.670 
and make sure again that it is perfectly
centered<00:03:30.430> with<00:03:31.430> measuring<00:03:31.970> tool<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.530> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
centered with measuring tool and that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.520 
centered with measuring tool and that
should<00:03:33.890> do<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.739> that's<00:03:36.739> step<00:03:37.400> three<00:03:38.530> step

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
better that way so this is close to 99.9

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.999 
better that way so this is close to 99.9
alright<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.199> take<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.860> and<00:05:01.949> put<00:05:02.949> it

alright so you just take this and put it
on<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.280> back<00:05:03.490> side<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.560> fifth<00:05:09.009> and

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
on the back side this is a fifth and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.240 
on the back side this is a fifth and
final<00:05:10.300> part<00:05:10.479> it's<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.410> most<00:05:11.620> crucial<00:05:11.860> part<00:05:12.039> in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
final part it's the most crucial part in

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.460 
final part it's the most crucial part in
the<00:05:12.370> whole<00:05:12.490> project<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:13.750> make<00:05:13.960> sure<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.289> birds

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
will come to it you need tape specially

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.860 
will come to it you need tape specially
cut<00:05:21.430> off<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.030> measure<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.539> little<00:05:22.660> bit
