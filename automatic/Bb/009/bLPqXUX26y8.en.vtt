00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.440 

I<00:00:13.320> remember<00:00:14.070> he<00:00:14.220> started<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.730> run<00:00:14.940> towards<00:00:15.090> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I remember he started to run towards the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.870 
I remember he started to run towards the
box<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.380> ball<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> sorted<00:00:17.430> into<00:00:17.610> any

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
box with the ball and I sorted into any

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.609 
box with the ball and I sorted into any
danger<00:00:18.330> initially<00:00:18.780> it<00:00:19.020> looked<00:00:19.290> like<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.590> had

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
danger initially it looked like you had

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.290 
danger initially it looked like you had
pretty<00:00:19.980> good<00:00:20.070> control<00:00:20.220> when<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.940> ball<00:00:21.119> was

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
pretty good control when the ball was

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.730 
pretty good control when the ball was
coming<00:00:21.450> in<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.020> were<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.619> up

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
coming in you were just going to go up

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
coming in you were just going to go up
and<00:00:22.920> pick<00:00:23.790> the<00:00:23.939> bell<00:00:24.150> well<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:25.860> people

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and pick the bell well one or two people

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
and pick the bell well one or two people
joked<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.520> me<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.760> say<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.450> can<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
joked to me and say how can a little

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
joked to me and say how can a little
fellow<00:00:28.200> like<00:00:28.260> him<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.800> jump<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.640> why

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
fellow like him out jump you and why

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.390 
fellow like him out jump you and why
didn't<00:00:30.690> you<00:00:30.720> knock<00:00:30.960> his<00:00:31.170> head<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:31.530> but<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.040> mean

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
didn't you knock his head off but I mean

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.010 
didn't you knock his head off but I mean
all<00:00:32.520> those<00:00:32.669> things<00:00:32.970> coming<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.449> your<00:00:33.570> mind<00:00:33.780> but

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
all those things coming to your mind but

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.619 
all those things coming to your mind but
I<00:00:34.080> think<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> time<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:36.090> always<00:00:36.239> second

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
I think at the time I was always second

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.570 
I think at the time I was always second
best<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.230> his<00:00:37.470> momentum<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.309> coming

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
best because his momentum was coming

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.240 
best because his momentum was coming
into<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.790> box<00:00:39.059> he<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.449> the<00:00:39.600> first<00:00:39.809> run<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
into the box he got the first run but I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.979 
into the box he got the first run but I
was<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.550> reaching<00:00:42.270> above<00:00:42.480> him<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.809> thought

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
was just reaching above him I thought

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
was just reaching above him I thought
I'm<00:00:43.199> just<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.250> wanted

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I'm just going to get this I just wanted

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.579 
I'm just going to get this I just wanted
to<00:00:44.879> knock<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> away<00:00:45.269> clear<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.839> danger<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
to knock it away clear the danger and

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.740 
to knock it away clear the danger and
the<00:00:47.250> next<00:00:47.519> thing<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.729> knew<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.420> ball<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.720> in

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the next thing I knew the ball was in

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.450 
the next thing I knew the ball was in
the<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> net<00:00:49.500> did<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.010> understand

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the back of the net did you understand

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
the back of the net did you understand
that<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.729> was<00:00:50.850> any<00:00:51.320> godly<00:00:52.320> incident<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that there was any godly incident that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.829 
that there was any godly incident that
some<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> I'll<00:00:54.150> try<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.479> extraordinary

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
some for you I'll try the extraordinary

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.780 
some for you I'll try the extraordinary
I<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.470> think<00:00:55.680> God'll<00:00:55.890> incident<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.580> how<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
I don't think God'll incident was how I

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.700 
I don't think God'll incident was how I
would<00:00:57.120> call<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.659> but<00:00:57.690> certainly<00:00:58.110> if<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.650> know

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
would call it but certainly if I know

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.160 
would call it but certainly if I know
but<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> certainly<00:00:59.540> cheated<00:01:00.540> yeah<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.780> mean<00:01:00.989> he

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but it certainly cheated yeah I mean he

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.350 
but it certainly cheated yeah I mean he
I<00:01:01.379> didn't<00:01:01.979> actually<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.430> him<00:01:02.519> do<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.909> but<00:01:03.330> I

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
I didn't actually see him do that but I

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.180 
I didn't actually see him do that but I
knew<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.989> something<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:04.860> must<00:01:05.010> have

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
knew that something like that must have

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.399 
knew that something like that must have
happened<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.970> saw<00:01:06.180> our<00:01:06.570> players<00:01:06.870> took

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
happened and then I saw our players took

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
happened and then I saw our players took
what<00:01:07.620> their<00:01:07.770> arms<00:01:08.100> up<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.549> sort<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> did<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
what their arms up and I sort of did the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
what their arms up and I sort of did the
same<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.690> I<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:11.100> looked<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> referee

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
same and I just looked at the referee

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.170 
same and I just looked at the referee
and<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.330> thought<00:01:12.860> yeah<00:01:13.860> blow<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.580> whistle<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and I thought yeah blow your whistle and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.969 
and I thought yeah blow your whistle and
then<00:01:15.720> he<00:01:15.840> ran<00:01:15.990> off<00:01:16.049> foot<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> pitch<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.770> thought

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
then he ran off foot the pitch I thought

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
then he ran off foot the pitch I thought
where<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.370> going<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.660> looked<00:01:18.960> across

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
where you going and then I looked across

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.110 
where you going and then I looked across
quickly<00:01:19.980> at<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.160> linesman<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.730> he<00:01:20.820> stood

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
quickly at the linesman and he stood

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.340 
quickly at the linesman and he stood
there<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.390> he<00:01:21.510> was<00:01:21.660> looking<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.110> again<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
there and he was looking at me again I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.500 
there and he was looking at me again I
thought<00:01:22.620> well<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.340> flag<00:01:23.550> up<00:01:23.730> and<00:01:23.940> then

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
thought well put your flag up and then

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.360 
thought well put your flag up and then
he<00:01:24.720> ran<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.260> pitch<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.310> just

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
he ran up the pitch and I it was just

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.760 
he ran up the pitch and I it was just
shock<00:01:26.730> that<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> goal<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.260> going<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.530> stand

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
shock that the goal was going to stand

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
shock that the goal was going to stand
at<00:01:29.100> something<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.820> happens<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.510> goals
