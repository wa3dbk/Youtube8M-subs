00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hi everyone, my name is daniele 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.210
 this is my first video I wanted 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.100
 tell you about the drones sincerely there 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 I consider very very funny a lot 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.890
 nice compared to the rc helicopter 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.750
 coaxial that a minimum of wind is enough e 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.160
 don't fly 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.320
 these instead I must say that yes 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.830
 they behave very very well too 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 with great wind I will show you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 let's say the leaves that move first 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.399
 which was much more windy and yet 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:40.860
 the drone flew quite well is a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.010
 four-engine with a lot of support 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 resistant before it made him slam 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 on a tree nothing was done e 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.629
 it is very well balanced 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.149
 stable even if there is wind and rimmel 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.149
 skillful seadream to all we say 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.300
 we all say that all the aces have the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.650
 drone is very very very precise I have to 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.770
 say despite being a toy 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 I bought this on e bay 80 euros if 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.830
 I am not mistaken I find myself quite well 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.440
 let's say public enough for me 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.470
 I was expecting a little something more 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.930
 honestly I think I buy on amazon 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.280
 and a helicopter that is twice the size of 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.220
 this then apologized that contrast 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.640
 surely it will be much better 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.310
 this is already good, however, it is already a lot 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.100
 effective for what it has to do 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 it is equipped with an adjustable hd camera 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.679
 interchangeable batteries you can 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.630
 buy five batteries and use them all 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:05.590
 together as they download and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.319
 the batteries are 3.7 volt and this 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.780
 model can mount you use up to 950 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.489
 milan for example can mount these 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.310
 1 sun nanotech all bacteria of the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.019
 comparison nanotech I feel good ne 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.440
 cost is still a fair price 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:32.579
 do their job and this at 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:36.180
 2.4 gigas remote control remote control 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:40.360
 so there are no frequency losses 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.160
 this is the little button to do the and the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.319
 in short, this is the camera 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.299
 remote then I'll explain it in the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:57.610
 next video and now we move to a 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:01.540
 another model a little smaller but in my own 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 more effective opinion in the sense that today 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.859
 I tried them on both 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.600
 I must say that the child behaves in 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:13.359
 so let's say more adequate and more 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.959
 faster more snappy it seems maybe even 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:20.620
 for very aerodynamic dimensions 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.200
 seems we don't say feel the wind like 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.200
 if there wasn't good but maybe a lot 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.139
 better this here than those more 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.109
 grandicello although I must say anyway 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.930
 that this nothing is not bad either 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.290
 I always have a reinforcement structure 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.470
 propellers fold so there is no risk 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.299
 that it is difficult to break them before they have me 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.430
 given up on a tree it was not done 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.319
 nothing 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.349
 also on this model much of the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.750
 ever nanotech batteries e 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.209
 now I'll show you it's batteries 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.799
 also these of the nanotech now puts a 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:08.190
 sorry moment at 260 milan for 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.190
 always technical 7 or so are already potential 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.160
 I paid € 30 of the € 40 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.530
 euro in short, in the next video I will make you 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.460
 see the two models I currently have 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.460
 in flight how they will behave 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 thank you
