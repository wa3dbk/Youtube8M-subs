what we have to identify and address and
get<00:02:32.240> better<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.110> not<00:02:33.230> far<00:02:33.470> maybe<00:02:33.830> it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
get better so it's not far maybe it's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.350

not<00:02:34.100> far<00:02:34.310> maybe<00:02:34.520> it's<00:02:34.670> whatever<00:02:34.820> far<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.240> is

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
not far maybe it's whatever far it is

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.680 
not far maybe it's whatever far it is
but<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:36.260> gotta<00:02:36.410> find<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.710> way<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.860> get<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.220> I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.180 

think<00:02:41.690> that's<00:02:41.810> an<00:02:41.990> excuse<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.530> think<00:02:42.740> back<00:02:42.950> in

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
think that's an excuse I think back in

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.060 
think that's an excuse I think back in
Miami<00:02:43.790> Ohio<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.209> was<00:02:44.270> pretty<00:02:44.630> good<00:02:45.070> right

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
Miami Ohio that was pretty good right

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.930 
Miami Ohio that was pretty good right
now<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.640> should<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:47.000> better<00:02:47.180> than<00:02:47.270> we<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.560> and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
now we should be better than we are and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.750 
now we should be better than we are and
just<00:02:49.940> kind<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.120> work<00:02:50.240> our<00:02:50.390> tails<00:02:50.420> off
