now that I've got the case mounted in
the<00:01:52.320> motherboard<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> system<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the motherboard back into the system I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.750 
the motherboard back into the system I
had<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.630> some<00:01:54.900> modifications<00:01:55.520> which<00:01:56.520> means

i had tin snips and some cutting to do
for<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.580> back<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> case<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> had<00:02:02.009> an<00:02:02.130> 80

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
for the back of the case now I had an 80

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.570 
for the back of the case now I had an 80
millimeter<00:02:02.759> fan<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> needed<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> 120<00:02:04.399> adapter<00:02:05.399> so

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
millimeter fan I needed a 120 adapter so

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.100 
millimeter fan I needed a 120 adapter so
i<00:02:05.640> hope<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.970> adapter<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:06.869> i'm<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.050> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
i hope this adapter on what i'm going to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
i hope this adapter on what i'm going to
do<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.320> I'm<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> push<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:08.039> air<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.940> cool

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
do is I'm going to push the air the cool

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.830 
do is I'm going to push the air the cool
air<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.600> outside<00:02:09.800> into<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.069> case<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
air from the outside into the case and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.180 
air from the outside into the case and
allow<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.020> cool<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.040> what<00:02:14.160> I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
allow it to cool like that so what I

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.440 
allow it to cool like that so what I
needed<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.970> needed<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.330> actually

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
needed to do is I needed to actually

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.340 
needed to do is I needed to actually
have<00:02:15.950> my<00:02:16.950> radiator<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.850> my<00:02:18.090> cpu<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
have my radiator and my cpu and I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.640 
have my radiator and my cpu and I
actually<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.970> slides<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.420> there

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
actually see how that slides in there

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.259 
actually see how that slides in there
actually<00:02:22.650> slides<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:23.760> mount<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
actually slides in and it will mount so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.810 
actually slides in and it will mount so
this<00:02:24.450> will<00:02:24.600> go<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.459> that's<00:02:26.640> what

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
this will go like that so that's what

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.110 
this will go like that so that's what
we're<00:02:27.000> planning<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:29.040> i<00:02:29.459> will

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
we're planning to do for this so i will

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.940 
we're planning to do for this so i will
get<00:02:30.330> everything<00:02:30.750> mounted

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.349 

so<00:02:36.950> what<00:02:37.129> I<00:02:37.159> needed<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.640> do<00:02:37.819> was<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.090> actually

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
so what I needed to do was I actually

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.240 
so what I needed to do was I actually
have<00:02:38.659> my<00:02:38.840> radiator<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.409> the<00:02:39.590> outside<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> have

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
have my radiator on the outside I have

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
have my radiator on the outside I have
the<00:02:40.340> fan<00:02:40.579> pulling<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> air<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.689> through<00:02:42.079> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the fan pulling the air in through this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.589 
the fan pulling the air in through this
way<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.799> it's<00:02:43.010> supposed<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.340> do<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.569> i

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
way as it's supposed to do and then i

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.160 
way as it's supposed to do and then i
have<00:02:44.719> my<00:02:44.900> corsair<00:02:45.739> unit<00:02:46.099> ready<00:02:46.609> to<00:02:47.359> go<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:48.019> it

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
have my corsair unit ready to go now it

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.539 
have my corsair unit ready to go now it
already<00:02:48.379> has<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.650> thermal<00:02:48.950> paste<00:02:49.129> apply<00:02:49.400> it's

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
already has the thermal paste apply it's

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.220 
already has the thermal paste apply it's
all<00:02:49.670> i<00:02:49.730> need<00:02:49.909> to<00:02:49.939> do<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.420> flip<00:02:51.379> it<00:02:51.530> over<00:02:51.620> here

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
all i need to do is flip it over here

all i need to do is flip it over here
mount<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.379> into<00:02:54.680> my<00:02:54.829> cpu<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.389> get<00:02:56.659> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
mount it into my cpu and then get the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.390 
mount it into my cpu and then get the
bracket<00:02:57.260> lined<00:02:58.010> up<00:02:58.219> so<00:02:58.609> to<00:02:58.670> do<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:58.879> I<00:02:59.060> just

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
bracket lined up so to do that I just

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
until it lines up once it lines up and

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.869 
until it lines up once it lines up and
all<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> need<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.269> do<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:17.810> go<00:03:17.959> in<00:03:18.189> and<00:03:19.189> tighten

all I need to do is to go in and tighten
up<00:03:20.919> the<00:03:21.919> bracket<00:03:27.219> to<00:03:28.219> get<00:03:28.340> everything<00:03:28.700> lined

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
up the bracket to get everything lined

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.050 
up the bracket to get everything lined
up<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.269> if<00:03:29.389> while<00:03:29.540> you're<00:03:29.569> seeing<00:03:29.959> this<00:03:30.049> okay

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
up so if while you're seeing this okay

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.830 
up so if while you're seeing this okay
everything's<00:03:32.060> lined<00:03:32.299> up<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.599> way<00:03:32.629> it's

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
everything's lined up the way it's

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.490 
everything's lined up the way it's
supposed<00:03:33.139> to<00:03:34.599> it<00:03:35.599> should<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.019> seated

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
supposed to it should have seated

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.679 
supposed to it should have seated
properly<00:03:36.879> now<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:37.939> only<00:03:38.150> thing<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.569> I<00:03:38.599> need

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:38.689 
properly now the only thing that I need

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.890 
properly now the only thing that I need
to<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.019> now<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.260> hook<00:03:39.620> up<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.949> two<00:03:40.900> electrical

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
to do now is hook up the two electrical

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.150 
to do now is hook up the two electrical
connections

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.680 

and<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.390> do<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.720> have<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.110> fan<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:52.240> I<00:03:52.450> have

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
and to do that I have the fan and I have

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.710 
and to do that I have the fan and I have
the<00:03:53.020> pump<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.030> pump<00:03:55.240> is<00:03:55.360> going<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.600> go<00:03:55.690> on

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
the pump so the pump is going to go on

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.420 
the pump so the pump is going to go on
one<00:03:56.020> side<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.620> fan<00:03:56.860> is<00:03:57.010> going<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.250> go<00:03:57.340> in

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
one side and the fan is going to go in

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.010 
one side and the fan is going to go in
the<00:03:57.520> other<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.910> unfortunately<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.660> have<00:03:58.810> enough

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
the other so unfortunately I have enough

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.690 
the other so unfortunately I have enough
cable<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.650> just<00:03:59.770> be<00:03:59.890> careful<00:04:00.250> because<00:04:00.400> of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
cable and I just be careful because of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.020 
cable and I just be careful because of
the<00:04:00.880> amount<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.400> serious<00:04:03.400> damage<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.880> did<00:04:03.970> to

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the amount of serious damage it did to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.180 
the amount of serious damage it did to
my<00:04:04.180> case<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.700> I'm<00:04:06.820> just<00:04:07.000> going<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.360> mount<00:04:11.190> and

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
my case and I'm just going to mount and

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:26.040 
my case and I'm just going to mount and
connect<00:04:22.380> first<00:04:23.380> connection<00:04:23.740> there<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.810> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
connect first connection there and the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.290 
connect first connection there and the
sexy<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.710> second<00:04:27.100> connection<00:04:27.400> excuse<00:04:27.940> my<00:04:28.090> big

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
sexy the second connection excuse my big

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.810 
sexy the second connection excuse my big
head<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.950> have<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.100> remember<00:04:30.310> where<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.670> had<00:04:31.660> it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.400 

so<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.570> what<00:04:39.750> I've<00:04:39.870> got<00:04:42.110> so<00:04:43.110> everything

went<00:04:43.890> through<00:04:44.100> pretty<00:04:44.490> straightforward<00:04:45.210> I

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
went through pretty straightforward I
