00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.700
 the expectation for Christmas sales 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 this year is not very optimistic second 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 specialists who take into account 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.279
 the low growth of consumption in other 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.350
 commemorative dates throughout 2014 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.570
 I am luciene miranda and this is the one 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.430
 Paulo's crown education rex had the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.630
 talk now to flávio calife 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.250
 good economist scpc because the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.149
 staff is not so excited for this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.370
 Christmas 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.020
 Look, this year's Christmas should be a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 a reflection of what we have seen all year 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 so it 's just a matter this Christmas 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.129
 since last year was already worth 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 It has grown less chance to grow 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.270
 and high rates're now growing 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.010
 a much lower rate 4% a year more or 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.020
 less and all the searches that we 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.180
 we did this year and all the indicators 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.370
 on this year's 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 all the commemorative dates show a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 lower than last year 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.180
 some even far smaller than tas 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.310
 get out of trade in bad times then 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.140
 It is to be expected five days I ask that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.939
 was recently the last date 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.979
 important aspect of trade was also 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.350
 less than in previous years that the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.520
 also has a smaller growth 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.630
 we still expect growth 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.580
 less Christmas is but a growth 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 smaller number of growth but still 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 should not be negatively expected 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.530
 is that we ask one by one and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 half a percent from last year 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.720
 already had moments from previous years 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 4 5% growth this year the event 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 more modest one more hill of the year 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.630
 past has been a warmer growth 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.149
 is this year and should also continue to be 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 take a well knowledge and ecologists 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 industry views this as the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.200
 trade is prepared for a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.689
 growth down to why these dates 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.070
 recent show what's going one 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.649
 consumer behavior 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.040
 more cautious with those worried 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.770
 contoured very confident that you are 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.140
 a little with lace growing up - hand price 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.120
 high that is taking continues 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 until it's own version of the credit 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.450
 it's harder to get this taking 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.950
 the consumer to consume less 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.630
 so the two are already more or less 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.640
 prepared for this, that all 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.680
 have already signaled that it is 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.430
 probably the soloist are already 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.080
 waiting for a Christmas with a growth 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.360
 small compared to the previous 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.090
 the rent this should be offset then 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.100
 for other purposes eg the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.580
 payment of debts instead of purchases 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.380
 Christmas still this 13th usually 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.780
 happens every year and usually does not 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.150
 will also happen and generally the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.250
 people enjoy is not to pay their 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.530
 debts to organize your budget is 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.019
 and it must happen of course that pattie 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.610
 for consumption, but as the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.750
 budgets are tighter for 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 account of rising prices of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 mainly consumption has been a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.310
 little affected 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.850
 then as in previous rounds 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.940
 even with the 11 resources that will 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.880
 come now and should not encourage both the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.040
 consumption as the previous moments 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.720
 provision of temporary jobs as well 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 should be reduced 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.100
 this expectation is of lower growth 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.320
 It's no different, you can not expect a 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.180
 very high growth in use by 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.070
 how to grow must still 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.260
 there is a movement nearer than the year 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.310
 you can expect the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.500
 jobs generated this year will be 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.269
 like last year should also not 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.709
 reduce should be more or less close 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.269
 last year the generation of employment 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.459
 temporary for this year 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.680
 flávio calife, thank you very much for your 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.090

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.610
 thank you very much
