00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.570
 stella says 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.969
 is urgent 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.969
 the fans and partners 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.599
 it's a justus track 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 just today almost nothing 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.369
 the readjustments 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.369
 of the six games played 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.450
 with the approximation of the population 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 one of the most difficult in the world of mothers 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 it's a curve 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.040
 the pilot has to be very delicate pontomobi 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.750
 suddenly the point of tangency appears in a scene now since curve 2 is a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 continuation of the class 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 the referee however in the second vat and as such to use more organized in thesis 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.790
 at 20 230 per hour 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.900
 then nothing 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 it's the only place in interlagos 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.070
 if a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.160
 who is ahead also tries to ensure that such a practice 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.460
 so sometimes 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.830
 andressa replied that paulo 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.830
 the approximation of the three present 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 I was worthy to testify 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.030
 The breech socket put out usually goes out front here very important to leave 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.700
 fast because after the court 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 the net has already rises towards the horseshoe 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 We leave here four or more domain 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.060
 200 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.860
 with the approach of the horseshoe with a building with the exception of the incra 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.380
 I feel very cold 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.060
 those of low speed 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.870
 who stands in the midst of severe 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.470
 here at the accelerator curve exit 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.069
 amorth who would already have 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.069
 and reaches four 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.829
 with a community more speed 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829
 it is very difficult to keep the car on the inner side of the track 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.999
 it is there that the car as well as the whole city 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.669
 according to cement data and from time to time the people about how they saw the second 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.549
 the season started 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.549
 on the second part of the track which is a bit that they have 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.269
 you could enjoy the sea 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.089
 over the show 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.489
 is one of the hardest tests and more - also that a year ago 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.719
 it is quite difficult the second installment has a rating because it made the new 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:54.649
 on sites of the curve of the sun at 245 of the debut modesty of these cruel people 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.889
 enough on an interlagos cold 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.769
 now it's going to me 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.059
 see how dollars be an orange that solano held by the state 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.199
 now at the bottom of the circuit sector 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.749
 and in the afternoon where the pilot coming back together with the pilot thymus 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.709
 can enter very strong can enter more men and never succeeded 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.459
 now the audience 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 young low speed all first with formula 1 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.869
 It's difficult because I know you did not want to get out of the car. 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.909
 despite the tracey diver everyone who has a good approach 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.699
 difficult 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.099
 what he decides he has done on the climb is starting now in braga 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.049
 have a car like that 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.349
 frequenting the ascent to the mountains 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.349
 despite the goal at the end of the climb is easy to do well low 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:23.119
 now in the first part of latin sports here at that time 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.080
 the EU's approach is one of the most
