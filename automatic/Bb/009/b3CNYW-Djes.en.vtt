main<00:01:30.060> reasoning<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.780> buying<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.520> stuff

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
main reasoning for buying all this stuff

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.789 
main reasoning for buying all this stuff
most<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.110> without<00:01:37.110> rule<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> law

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
most of it is for a without rule of law

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.140 
most of it is for a without rule of law
situation<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
situation you know pretty much just a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
situation you know pretty much just a
you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.200> hell<00:01:43.470> breaks<00:01:43.770> loose<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you know all hell breaks loose and you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.310 
you know all hell breaks loose and you
gotta<00:01:44.549> defend<00:01:45.090> yourself<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:45.659> family

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.660 

I'm<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> college<00:01:49.860> student<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.369> don't<00:01:50.520> have

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
I'm a college student so I don't have

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.060 
I'm a college student so I don't have
you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.509> gobs<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.320> money<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.649> spending

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you know gobs of money to be spending

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.149 
you know gobs of money to be spending
but<00:01:54.500> what<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> yalls<00:01:56.159> opinion<00:01:57.049> on<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:59.040> much

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but what is yalls opinion on how much

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.910 
but what is yalls opinion on how much
ammo<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.579> necessary<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
ammo is necessary because if it's it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.490 
ammo is necessary because if it's it
gets<00:02:02.070> real<00:02:02.310> bad<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.000> something<00:02:03.750> happens<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
gets real bad and something happens you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
gets real bad and something happens you
know<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.880> stuff<00:02:06.060> can't<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.540> carried

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
know all this stuff can't be carried

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.300 
know all this stuff can't be carried
with<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:09.000> mean

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
with here so I mean

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.010 
with here so I mean
I<00:02:10.429> don't<00:02:11.300> know<00:02:11.390> what's<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> point<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:11.959> you

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
I don't know what's the point of you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.750 
I don't know what's the point of you
getting<00:02:12.170> any<00:02:12.440> more<00:02:12.530> i<00:02:12.620> mean<00:02:12.739> i<00:02:12.800> think<00:02:12.860> for

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
getting any more i mean i think for

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.309 
getting any more i mean i think for
because<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.300> glock<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.630> what<00:02:15.080> i'm<00:02:15.140> going<00:02:15.230> to

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
because that glock is what i'm going to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.680 
because that glock is what i'm going to
be<00:02:15.380> shooting<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.830> 40<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:17.270> other<00:02:17.480> than

be shooting is 40 out of and other than

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.650 
be shooting is 40 out of and other than
target<00:02:18.080> practice<00:02:18.700> this<00:02:19.700> stuff<00:02:20.030> would<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.330> be

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
target practice this stuff would just be

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.130 
target practice this stuff would just be
used<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.830> hopefully<00:02:22.760> would<00:02:23.690> never<00:02:23.900> have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
