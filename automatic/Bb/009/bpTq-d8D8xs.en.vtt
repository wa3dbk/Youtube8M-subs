00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Speak to 21 people 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.000
 The current time is undecided 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.549
 I can not do without you 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.999
 Detect the world 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.009
 Me too 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.009
 Do what you need to do for the snow 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.630
 Thank you 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 I think from now on I will come along well with Ming 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.339
 City please again 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.380
 Really 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.300
 I will consult with the director 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.470
 I can not get time 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.470
 I support you 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 Thank you 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.940
 Bullying problem 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.060
 I'm sorry 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 The number is also 142 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 Once again thank you 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.609
 From my head again 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.209
 One more step 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.450
 The same player will play first in the morning 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.789
 There was also such a thing 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:26.099
 US time is still up to you- 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.099
 what 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.589
 surely 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:32.759
 It was characterized that it was bad 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.379
 Outlook for all models 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.699
 Is it sending 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:39.729
 I can't go to a concert 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.549
 I have 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.299
 In addition, it is blocking around 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.919
 Driven himself 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.279
 that is 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:47.889
 Protest against this 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.299
 After cooking 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.369
 It does not go for the denial of the upper house 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.339
 At least that it is doing well 

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.969
 Surely a word 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.109
 First mound 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.789
 Like that 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:01.789
 small 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.539
 If it says so, it will move frustrated 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.679
 I'm new to steak 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:08.900
 Still not enough 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.959
 Such 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.059
 We ate out to chicks 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.059
 The reason for this 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:18.019
 Happy 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620
 I did a snow concert 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.569
 I did not want to run through 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.659
 Working 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.110
 See things 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.590
 Once 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 He broke 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.539
 If marriage gets clear 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.490
 And 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.509
 I have a group 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.479
 1 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.289
 draft 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
 8 o'clock 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.740
 Yes 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.669
 End 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.669
 Housewife in the city 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.650
 Showed a stance of predecessor 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.569
 Displayed to operate
