00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.720 

kind<00:02:06.880> of<00:02:06.969> difficult<00:02:07.420> actually<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:09.729> go

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.680 

and<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.209> have<00:02:16.239> it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
and there you have it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.440 
and there you have it
so<00:02:17.650> inside<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.879> really<00:02:19.239> anything

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
heavy it's a heavier material because

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.920 
heavy it's a heavier material because
they<00:02:26.530> use<00:02:26.769> what's<00:02:27.670> forged<00:02:28.120> obviously<00:02:28.690> and
