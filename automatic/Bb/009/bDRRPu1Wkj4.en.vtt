ground<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.150> much<00:00:18.300> as<00:00:18.359> there<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.810> earlier

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
ground not as much as there was earlier

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019 
ground not as much as there was earlier
when<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.500> made<00:00:19.740> my<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:19.949> video<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> see

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
when I made my first video for I see

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.540 
when I made my first video for I see
your<00:00:21.150> iPhone<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:23.039> there

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
your iPhone as you can see right there

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.420 
your iPhone as you can see right there
there<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> lot<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.180> snow<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.130> most<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.279> its

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
there was a lot more snow I most of its

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.960 
there was a lot more snow I most of its
melted<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.289> hopefully<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:29.010> restock<00:00:29.670> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
melted but hopefully it will restock in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299 
melted but hopefully it will restock in
tonight<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.199> will<00:00:31.230> freeze<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.099> it's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
tonight and it will freeze because it's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.729 
tonight and it will freeze because it's
supposed<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.880> down<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.540> 18<00:00:34.200> degrees<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
supposed to get down to 18 degrees I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.569 
supposed to get down to 18 degrees I
think<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.790> yeah<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:36.899> cold<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.010> I'm

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
think so yeah that's pretty cold and I'm

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
think so yeah that's pretty cold and I'm
hoping<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.180> will<00:00:39.329> cancel<00:00:39.600> school<00:00:40.050> again

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
hoping they will cancel school again

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
hoping they will cancel school again
tomorrow<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.520> case<00:00:41.760> i'll<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.149> making<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
tomorrow in which case i'll be making a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
tomorrow in which case i'll be making a
ton<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> videos<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.620> channel<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.370> also

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
ton of videos for this channel and also

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.020 
ton of videos for this channel and also
for<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:44.940> main<00:00:45.149> channel<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.579> actual

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
for my main channel so on to my actual

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.010 
for my main channel so on to my actual
main<00:00:48.690> point<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.469> video<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:49.829> guess<00:00:50.420> iOS<00:00:51.420> 4.3

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
main point of this video i guess iOS 4.3

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
main point of this video i guess iOS 4.3
so<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> features<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so these are some of the features that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
so these are some of the features that
will<00:00:53.969> most<00:00:54.300> likely<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> we're

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
will most likely see in it we're

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
will most likely see in it we're
probably<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> implementation

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
probably going to see the implementation

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.770 
probably going to see the implementation
of<00:00:57.660> hotspot<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:59.129> gsm<00:00:59.640> users<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> personal

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
of hotspot for gsm users so the personal

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.380 
of hotspot for gsm users so the personal
hotspot<00:01:00.989> thing<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.250> verizon<00:01:02.820> users<00:01:02.850> have

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
hotspot thing that verizon users have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.990 
hotspot thing that verizon users have
where<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.960> tether<00:01:04.369> devices<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.700> their

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
where they can tether devices to their

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
where they can tether devices to their
iphone<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.710> actually<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> pay<00:01:08.549> an

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
iphone I you actually have to pay an

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.469 
iphone I you actually have to pay an
additional<00:01:09.240> fee<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:11.000> hopefully<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
additional fee for that but hopefully it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.410 
additional fee for that but hopefully it
will<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.900> implemented<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.830> iOS<00:01:14.430> 4.3<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
will be implemented into iOS 4.3 now I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.600 
will be implemented into iOS 4.3 now I
really<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:15.990> care<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:17.070> actually

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
really don't care because i actually

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.800 
really don't care because i actually
just<00:01:17.909> Heather<00:01:18.360> mine<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:19.409> my<00:01:20.369> why<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.240> for

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just Heather mine with my why but for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.899 
just Heather mine with my why but for
everybody<00:01:22.500> who<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> guess<00:01:23.250> doesn't<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.759> my

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
everybody who I guess doesn't have my

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.420 
everybody who I guess doesn't have my
wire<00:01:24.150> isn't<00:01:24.450> jailbroken<00:01:24.920> then<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> look

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
wire isn't jailbroken then they can look

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.810 
wire isn't jailbroken then they can look
forward<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:28.220> multi-touch<00:01:29.220> gestures

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
forward to that I multi-touch gestures

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.390 
forward to that I multi-touch gestures
also<00:01:30.420> might<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.930> enabled<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> iPad<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
also might be enabled on the iPad the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
also might be enabled on the iPad the
reason<00:01:32.759> why<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> say<00:01:33.119> might<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.170> they

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
reason why I say might is because they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.210 
reason why I say might is because they
were<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.880> first<00:01:36.270> public<00:01:36.810> beta

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
were actually in the first public beta

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.179 
were actually in the first public beta
version<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.630> 4.3<00:01:39.630> however<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.680> were<00:01:40.740> taken

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
version of 4.3 however they were taken

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
version of 4.3 however they were taken
out<00:01:41.340> after<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.259> if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
out after that so I don't know if

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
out after that so I don't know if
they're<00:01:43.470> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.829> them<00:01:43.920> back<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.460> 24

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
they're going to put them back in 24

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.289 
they're going to put them back in 24
points<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.689> you're<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:46.729> airplay<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.939> also

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
points or you're not airplay will also

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
points or you're not airplay will also
support<00:01:48.659> third-party<00:01:49.470> things<00:01:49.710> such<00:01:50.009> as

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
support third-party things such as

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
support third-party things such as
YouTube<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.970> should<00:01:51.630> also<00:01:51.930> support<00:01:52.530> things

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
YouTube it should also support things

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
YouTube it should also support things
online<00:01:52.979> as<00:01:53.369> well<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.299> basically<00:01:54.570> just

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
online as well so you can basically just

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.380 
online as well so you can basically just
stream<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:56.159> YouTube<00:01:56.670> videos<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
stream I like YouTube videos for

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.300 
looks weird to me I don't know I so what
else<00:02:29.030> they<00:02:30.030> will<00:02:30.690> probably<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.530> full<00:02:31.860> screen

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
full screen I ads will probably pay a

full screen I ads will probably pay a
lot<00:02:43.890> more<00:02:43.920> than<00:02:44.400> regular<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.210> ads<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.960> they

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
lot more than regular I ads and they

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.030 
lot more than regular I ads and they
will<00:02:46.410> also<00:02:46.680> look<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.950> lot<00:02:47.160> better<00:02:47.460> too<00:02:48.710> so<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
will also look a lot better too so the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.300 
will also look a lot better too so the
side<00:02:50.310> switch<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.390> side<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.530> iPad<00:02:53.040> will

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
side switch on the side of the iPad will

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.620 
side switch on the side of the iPad will
now<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.880> able<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.180> actually<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:55.860> able<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.630> wait

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
now be able to actually be able to wait

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.200 
now be able to actually be able to wait
that<00:02:57.780> didn't<00:02:57.960> make<00:02:58.020> any<00:02:58.080> sense<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that didn't make any sense at all so the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.600 
that didn't make any sense at all so the
side<00:03:00.660> switch<00:03:00.960> on<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.140> iPad<00:03:01.680> will<00:03:02.220> either<00:03:02.400> be
