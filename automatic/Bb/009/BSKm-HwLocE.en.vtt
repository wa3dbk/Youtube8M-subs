about<00:00:14.040> changing<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> oil<00:00:14.820> properly<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.039> guess

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
about changing the oil properly I guess

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.189 
about changing the oil properly I guess
if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.520> want<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> say<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.180> changed<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.869> spark

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
if you want to say I changed my spark

if you want to say I changed my spark
plugs<00:00:19.500> recently<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.539> guess<00:00:21.869> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
plugs recently or just now I guess you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
plugs recently or just now I guess you
should<00:00:22.260> say<00:00:23.869> they<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:28.369> see

here the dipstick tube suck out about
six<00:00:46.680> quarts<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.070> took<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
six quarts I took out of it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
six quarts I took out of it
I<00:00:47.940> used<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:49.190> Kawasaki<00:00:50.190> original<00:00:50.940> filter<00:00:51.629> which

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I used a Kawasaki original filter which

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.540 
I used a Kawasaki original filter which
is<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.980> clip<00:00:53.219> made<00:00:53.460> by<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> truth<00:00:55.770> It's<00:00:56.129> Made

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is a clip made by to the truth It's Made

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
is a clip made by to the truth It's Made
word<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.390> made<00:00:57.690> I've<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> find<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
word is so made I've got to find the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.990 
word is so made I've got to find the
original<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.579> anyway<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:05.000> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
original one but anyway so it is a one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
original one but anyway so it is a one
one<00:01:06.630> six<00:01:06.900> zero<00:01:07.020> nine<00:01:07.799> seven<00:01:07.830> triple<00:01:08.670> zero

eight<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:10.290> only<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> change<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.640> filter

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
eight the only way to change that filter

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.990 
eight the only way to change that filter
underneath<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.720> intake<00:01:13.020> manifold<00:01:13.850> if<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
underneath the intake manifold if you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940 
underneath the intake manifold if you
have<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.450> small<00:01:15.780> abortionist<00:01:16.560> hand<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
have a very small abortionist hand you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
have a very small abortionist hand you
could<00:01:17.070> probably<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> from<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
could probably get to it from here but I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.289 
could probably get to it from here but I
took<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> access<00:01:20.130> panel<00:01:20.549> stuck<00:01:20.850> my<00:01:21.090> big

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
took out the access panel stuck my big

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.649 
took out the access panel stuck my big
long<00:01:21.540> arm<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:23.189> able<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.700> change

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
long arm in there and was able to change

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.560 
long arm in there and was able to change
the<00:01:25.110> filter<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.590> barely<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:27.000> careful<00:01:27.420> right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the filter just barely be careful right

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
the filter just barely be careful right
up<00:01:27.720> above<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> oil<00:01:28.290> filter<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.040> oil

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
up above the oil filter is the oil

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.929 
up above the oil filter is the oil
pressure<00:01:29.640> switch<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.259> break<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
pressure switch and you can break it

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
pressure switch and you can break it
it's<00:01:32.939> happened<00:01:33.299> before<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:35.009> careful

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it's happened before so be very careful

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.410 
it's happened before so be very careful
with<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
with that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
with that
so<00:01:37.290> yeah<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.040> spark<00:01:38.369> plugs<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.670> change<00:01:38.970> them

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so yeah the spark plugs that change them

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.330 
so yeah the spark plugs that change them
oil<00:01:39.600> filter<00:01:40.020> got<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> from<00:01:40.590> Amazon<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
oil filter got it from Amazon and the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.749 
oil filter got it from Amazon and the
oil<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.670> I'm<00:01:41.850> using<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:43.020> 10<00:01:43.649> W<00:01:44.130> 40<00:01:44.579> white

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
oil that I'm using is a 10 W 40 white

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.969

Lucas<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.420> they're<00:01:48.659> recommending<00:01:48.979> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
Lucas that's what they're recommending I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
Lucas that's what they're recommending I
would<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.820> reading<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
would do some reading up on it just to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
would do some reading up on it just to
be<00:01:52.350> sure<00:01:52.380> that's<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.189> putting<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.610> mind

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
be sure that's what I'm putting in mind

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
be sure that's what I'm putting in mind
I'm<00:01:54.060> not<00:01:54.210> saying<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I'm not saying that you got to use I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
I'm not saying that you got to use I
guess<00:01:56.399> depending<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> temperatures<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
guess depending on the temperatures of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
guess depending on the temperatures of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
where you're going and what you're doing

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
where you're going and what you're doing
but<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.659> Washington<00:02:00.719> state<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.710> not

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
but here in Washington state it's not

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.010 
but here in Washington state it's not
too<00:02:02.219> bad<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.360> yes<00:02:03.630> six<00:02:04.320> quarts<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:05.270> 10<00:02:06.270> W<00:02:06.600> 40

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
too bad so yes six quarts about 10 W 40

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.100 
too bad so yes six quarts about 10 W 40
