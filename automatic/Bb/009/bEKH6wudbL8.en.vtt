00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.660
 hello you love to welcome 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.540
 a new episode of my series 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.210
 nice hair as you can see 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.980
 I'm surprised again dyed the hair 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.840
 but not if I'm the next 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.009
 videos suddenly have red hair again 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.410
 I have this month one 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.000
 bit worked up and yes 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.859
 accordingly, the hair is just as 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.390
 still good 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.120
 I have my hair with me again 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.890
 Plant colored hair color and this time 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.850
 I have the plant hair color of the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.130
 The brand used and that is that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.040
 the color dark brown 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.989
 so it looks even and the personal 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.059
 color of kali is of course pure 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.790
 natural cosmetics it is 100 percent 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.250
 herbal and she even has at Ã–kotest 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.230
 with very good marks and I have 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.090
 These plant hair color on amazon 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.160
 I can order the page again 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.559
 link below in the infobox 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.649
 with shipping costs has the whole thing about 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:08.800
 cost ten euros is still 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:11.590
 cheaper than the plant got from logona 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.270
 which costs about 13 euros 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.510
 and i find this plant color 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.549
 really top so I think she is better 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.520
 as the plant of lucona she is 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.810
 cheaper and she just covers great 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.460
 So you almost do not see anything anymore 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.930
 my red have been here and there agree 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.390
 as I think a bit through 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 but that's probably more likely 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.650
 that the hair is not in place 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.630
 Well enough , here you are 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.950
 before after I had before 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.840
 so or reddish red hair so it has 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.070
 get out pretty soon 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.060
 washed and now you see one 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.009
 Brown hair 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.810
 Above all, I also like that there 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.030
 no perfume in it just so it's one 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.630
 you smell a bit better okay 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.520
 smell really not so great and short 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.780
 after the stuff just washed out 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.970
 does one really think one is somehow 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.689
 on the farm surrounded by hay and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.989
 straw and grass track and what do I know and 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.209
 you think I still smell it 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.980
 a bit later but that can not be 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.540
 if I can handle such a nice 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.400
 few result has because you really has 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.860
 barely red in it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.090
 you hardly see it red, I know it 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.590
 but not as it is with the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.480
 wash out behaves I have the hair 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.040
 once washed since it is called 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.049
 also that I am indigo what yes 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.780
 somehow I think that is rather greenish 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.310
 quickly out right than that dealer that 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.530
 means the hair can then over time 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 I am becoming more reddish, of course 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.040
 personally does not find some bad 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.840
 also has red hair before but if 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.620
 that's not good for her now is that 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.540
 of course bitter 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 They take care of their hair with natural 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.599
 active ingredients without the structure of 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.810
 to intervene 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.560
 all our plants are colors 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.480
 pollutant tested and subject 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.450
 strict controls you can do this 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.480
 Mix colors with each other , too 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 as you like it from touching it 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.950
 as this plant but actually almost 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.409
 exactly the same as the plant colors of 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.720
 logona but there with this dark brown 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.340
 a lot of indigo is included 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.439
 Do not touch it with hot water 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.450
 but only with 50 degrees warm water 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.040
 and you can also get black tea 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.859
 I also used what I did 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.379
 a lot of tea bags used black tea 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.319
 and then I have the plants 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.030
 hair color mixed in I have about 300 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.650
 millimeter used and the whole 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.370
 to listen and but it has not quite 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.989
 enough 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.940
 I got a little bit attached to that 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.909
 Planting experience oriented by Lucona 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.310
 but here is more powder in it than at 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.750
 logona and that's why it just did not work that way 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.000
 quite enough for the whole thing 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.260
 a little thinner to get it 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.030
 of course, should not be completely fluid 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.190
 you need such a pampe but the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.430
 had already so a bit of distributing 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.760
 be bar and that's why I had to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.840
 So he adds a bit more 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.239
 I'll probably be a little bit more 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.709
 than 300 milliliters need and before 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.989
 it was actually accurate 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.810
 The only thing you want is the hair 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.340
 before that does not wash like hohner does 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.799
 You can also do it on the dry hair 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.780
 make and say this is meant to be towel 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.769
 be dry so washed towel 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.000
 dry hair 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.230
 They also say you should pay attention 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.300
 that the color does not cool 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.100
 has to make everything nice and warm and I 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.769
 I also tried the color in solution 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.389
 keep the water bath warm so the pot 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.120
 I woke him up with warm water 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.280
 but the color is still 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.720
 got cold someday but that has 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.340
 as you do not really see much 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.300
 so you need it there 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.910
 do not go crazy 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.130
 when your color cools it is 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.949
 still works the whole thing 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.810
 have night about two and a half almost three 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.040
 Leave on for hours despite the fact 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.810
 you stand there on the only two 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.220
 Allow hours to act and the fans 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.919
 The hair also cares for color 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.870
 really nice so before that was yes 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.130
 really somehow i do not know what 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.350
 I did with those somehow 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.240
 they were very dissatisfied and only 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.039
 so dreadful and somehow not 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.669
 more so beautiful and now everything is back 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.650
 expensive 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.960
 now they are somehow satisfied with them 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.260
 are strong and I have one again 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.330
 a bit more volume and now I am 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.580
 happy again permanent tint 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.389
 unique care volume and 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.300
 radiance 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.400
 So everything is right or me 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.870
 do not know if that is relative 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.880
 out quickly but I will 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.620
 you then in the infobox yet 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.570
 So I can tell you the whole 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.919
 close to carly really great 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.389
 I'll even just cara the 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.729
 Buy plants after colors and not more 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.169
 from logona because I think the result 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.419
 just super nice 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.440
 so this color is my area it is 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.180
 not everyone's taste 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.210
 maybe I'm a bit too 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.250
 pale for those dark hairs but me 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.289
 think the color is really nice 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.610
 become 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.039
 I highly recommend it and at 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.930
 Next time I paint the colors 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.990
 try brown 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.010
 let's see how it will be that 's it 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.760
 catch up 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.130
 I just wanted my erfahrungsbericht 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.360
 to the k give the planter color and 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:07.160
 I say how great that is then 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.900
 I wish you a nice week 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.900
 and see you in the next video 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.770
 Welcome to a third 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.690
 I can also give you the link below 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:38.250
 link and I have the place choice 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:41.669
 color on Amazon ordered the child here 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.979
 and the plant and I have the 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.389
 Plant ordered on Amazon 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.389
 I can see you below 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:56.900
 all of them have in two 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:07:00.120
 minutes you would lick so 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.360
 hair strand there is something behind there 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.360
 stay 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:12.770
 who is actually liable permanently 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.870
 reveals that is somehow 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.870
 contradictory here are long lasting
