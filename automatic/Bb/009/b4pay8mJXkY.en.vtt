00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.619
 well the inverter's rotating scheme 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 a three-phase motor or even a motor 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.099
 single phase with a capacitor what is 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.860
 the circuit diagram with switches 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.160
 is the next we have a contact 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.750
 with four contacts are all 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.830
 open at the time the act 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.690
 coil would close another contactor here 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.360
 it's exactly the same and we have 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.880
 also some auxiliary contacts 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.220
 both in one and in another one is open 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.630
 and closed 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.630
 we also have the engine 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.260
 with the bridges for example in star 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.810
 or triangle is indifferent as you have 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.580
 what matters is how it should be 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.590
 work depending on the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.040
 features its ground wire 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.900
 protection the thermal relay and what 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.350
 we have to do is feed neutral 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.560
 the two coils 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.380
 and what is the phase we take to the relay 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.570
 thermal means that if the motor is 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.250
 there are two phases or there is some problem 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.799
 because they are decompensated and jump or 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.490
 there is a short or anything and it makes 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.420
 skip the thermal relay this contact will 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.580
 will open and prevent what is the maneuver 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.170
 or normal operation we are going to 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.399
 suppose it's working 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.590
 correctly feeds what is a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.619
 Three position switch where 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.860
 has 1 0 and 2 to 0 and right we can 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.470
 activate that works to the left 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.940
 we went through the 0 and the right if 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.009
 we leave on the left or right we're going 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.990
 to run continuously so as to 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.850
 three positions 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.140
 by leaving it at the zero where we connect 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.890
 automatically besides that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.960
 I followed what we follow is 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.000
 taking the maneuver for example we are going to 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.370
 suppose we want it to rotate to the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.940
 right we follow what is the cable of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 the maneuver we went through the contact 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.500
 opposite is to say the counter in 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.510
 driver that causes you to turn to the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.150
 left where we're going to use the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.330
 contact closed so that if this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.170
 contactor will come into operation will 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.230
 would open when this contact is at rest 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.110
 is closed so it gives way to the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.230
 coil that we want to be activated is 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.019
 say the for example the turn in this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.620
 case to the right let's assume that it is 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.600
 otherwise we take and put the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.910
 switch 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.450
 on the left or in the direction of rotation 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.310
 left we followed him through the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.800
 contact closed 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.140
 d 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.550
 the turn to the right or it always has 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.580
 to be the opposite contact and the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.060
 opposite contact gives way to the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.930
 coil and activate what is the coil 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.690
 from the contact to the left very well 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.290
 well this the theoretical 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.630
 and we're already starting to see how 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.740
 is 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.470
 the assembly of the inverter maneuver 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.880
 of rotation of the three-phase motor and the scheme 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.880
 of the maneuver
