00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 and now I show you to all good 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 last how to install the video card 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.349
 but little update here was before 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.940
 hints judge 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 which has seen perhaps the same is my 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680
 he has a dull 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.180
 done 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.160
 cousin flash and everything is broken 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
 gone and it was complete 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.670
 then I have been burned 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.990
 tried deilmann my own 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.830
 increase fan to connect 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.180
 Well then anyway well shreds anyway 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.290
 is a little bit broke 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 but nonetheless, let's start 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.050
 need to install the graphics card 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:50.340
 here at the case this screw 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:54.860
 turn out and then we can get the pci 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.860
 Simply remove brackets 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.550
 and you can install the video card 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.090
 that's what we do now and 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.650
 Although here takes the graphics card it is 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:16.479
 actually easier how to get that 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:21.159
 maybe the graphics card plugged thinks 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 They first acted on the rule 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:33.039
 side of her on video in the high presses 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 with a bit of pressure from above a bit 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.250
 on it and that 's it the graphic designer of the iss 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 So now installed course 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.130
 you have to do is you may have to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.170
 I'm not sure 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.920
 here you can come in a bit 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.670
 Do you have the two power cables here 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.220
 still connect 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.869
 there's six stages on the other 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 You need eight bands here for the 8 pin 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.929
 I say now fold times and 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.849
 then get stuck up 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.220
 but since I can not see anyway 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.110
 do it yourself so fast 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.810
 but I had one inside unfortunately 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.819
 few small problems the cables must 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.110
 you bend a bit but that 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.440
 I think I can go 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.980
 they're just stuck inside the pc 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.819
 A break it came to see job market here 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.180
 and then you take the questions 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.010
 and dust the individual or just the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 here you have to go around a bit 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.860
 noodles and watch how that fits and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.349
 then looks firmly so the women 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.340
 are installed or respectively 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.410
 screwed in and what of the pc 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.260
 world i would say this is the system 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 you really only have to if now 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.760
 install it or any other 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.379
 operating system and then you can 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.120
 actually start right now too 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.040
 Start the drivers a bit 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.569
 of course install and yes the brut 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.210
 You still have to set hard disk 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.920
 we still have to say from which 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:17.700
 plate should be booted and yes that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.500
 was the pc world of this xpc it applies 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.690
 I liked it I hope it was one 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.690
 a bit instructive and not quite so 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:32.210
 So messes up so confused 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.320
 but I hope you liked it 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.050
 and maybe I will have sometime 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.120
 benchmark out soon why this 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.110
 system itself at current games or 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.610
 for the sake of performance and to hero and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.560
 I would say we see each other in one 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.670
 my next videos and read 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.310
 maybe a thumb up thumb down 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.310
 there and has one and servus
