hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:01.140> my<00:00:01.290> name<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.589> Phil<00:00:01.800> Lesh<00:00:02.040> anko<00:00:02.370> and

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hey guys my name is Phil Lesh anko and

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.280 
hey guys my name is Phil Lesh anko and
today<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> show<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.629> how<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> make

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.160 
today I'm going to show you how to make
your<00:00:04.500> own<00:00:04.680> PCBs<00:00:05.310> using<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> toner<00:00:06.540> transfer

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
your own PCBs using the toner transfer

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.770 
your own PCBs using the toner transfer
method<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.490> can<00:00:09.000> build<00:00:09.240> something<00:00:09.599> like

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
method so you can build something like

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.910 
method so you can build something like
this<00:00:10.200> or<00:00:10.920> whatever<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> build<00:00:12.920> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
this or whatever you want to build the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.310 
this or whatever you want to build the
first<00:00:14.160> step<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.790> prepare<00:00:15.000> board<00:00:15.690> design<00:00:16.080> in

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
first step is to prepare board design in

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.859 
first step is to prepare board design in
your<00:00:16.470> favorite<00:00:16.980> CAD<00:00:17.220> software<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.000> print<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
your favorite CAD software and print it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.700

out<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.320> single<00:00:19.770> sided<00:00:20.039> glossy<00:00:20.490> paper<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.710> use

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
out on a single sided glossy paper I use

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189 
out on a single sided glossy paper I use
ego<00:00:23.100> as<00:00:23.279> my<00:00:23.490> CAD<00:00:23.699> software<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.050> can

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ego as my CAD software and as you can

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.759 
ego as my CAD software and as you can
see<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.800> board<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.369> already<00:00:26.880> been<00:00:27.150> made<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
see the board has already been made and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.519

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.109 
little chance you will damage thing
tracks<00:05:23.860> on<00:05:24.069> your<00:05:24.219> board<00:05:26.309> this<00:05:27.309> is<00:05:27.369> how<00:05:27.729> very

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.119 
tracks on your board this is how very

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:38.330 
tracks on your board this is how very
chloride<00:05:28.629> usually<00:05:29.199> looks<00:05:29.469> like

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.180 

if<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:39.720> want<00:05:39.930> to<00:05:39.990> really<00:05:40.170> fast<00:05:40.530> edging<00:05:41.040> you

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
if you want to really fast edging you

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.640 
if you want to really fast edging you
can<00:05:41.490> pour<00:05:41.760> some<00:05:41.790> really<00:05:42.630> hot<00:05:42.840> water<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.470> the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
can pour some really hot water in the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:54.050 
can pour some really hot water in the
bigger<00:05:43.860> container<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:52.580> put<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.760> smaller

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
bigger container and put the smaller

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:11.400 
bigger container and put the smaller
container<00:05:54.390> inside

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.730 

and<00:06:12.210> remember<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.570> stuff<00:06:13.870> is<00:06:14.050> really<00:06:14.440> toxic

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
and remember this stuff is really toxic

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:25.290 
and remember this stuff is really toxic
so<00:06:15.190> don't<00:06:15.460> try<00:06:15.700> to<00:06:15.760> drink<00:06:16.210> that<00:06:24.090> step<00:06:25.090> number

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
so don't try to drink that step number

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.590 
so don't try to drink that step number
six<00:06:25.780> clean<00:06:26.680> your<00:06:26.860> board<00:06:27.190> from<00:06:27.430> toner<00:06:27.850> using

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
six clean your board from toner using

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:57.659 
six clean your board from toner using
some<00:06:29.020> acetone<00:06:29.590> and<00:06:29.890> cotton<00:06:30.280> pads

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.300 

step<00:06:58.669> number<00:06:58.880> seven<00:06:59.479> drill<00:06:59.870> holes<00:07:00.169> and<00:07:00.470> I<00:07:01.070> get

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
step number seven drill holes and I get

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.100 
step number seven drill holes and I get
to<00:07:01.430> say<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:01.610> really<00:07:01.970> hate<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.330> do<00:07:02.600> that<00:07:02.630> and

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
to say I really hate to do that and

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.469 
to say I really hate to do that and
that's<00:07:03.800> why<00:07:04.039> when<00:07:04.250> designing<00:07:04.639> new<00:07:04.970> board<00:07:05.270> I'm

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 
that's why when designing new board I'm

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:22.680 
that's why when designing new board I'm
trying<00:07:06.289> to<00:07:06.470> use<00:07:06.680> exclusively<00:07:07.160> SMD<00:07:07.970> components

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.240 

and<00:07:25.000> here's<00:07:26.000> the<00:07:26.330> final<00:07:26.539> result<00:07:26.949> size<00:07:27.949> of<00:07:28.130> the

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
and here's the final result size of the

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.430 
and here's the final result size of the
resistors<00:07:28.729> and<00:07:28.940> capacitors<00:07:29.539> are<00:07:29.810> away<00:07:30.380> to

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 
resistors and capacitors are away to

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:39.490 
resistors and capacitors are away to
five

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.950 

and<00:07:39.700> finally<00:07:40.700> I<00:07:40.730> wanted<00:07:41.150> to<00:07:41.270> show<00:07:41.450> you<00:07:41.480> what<00:07:41.840> it

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
and finally I wanted to show you what it

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.980 
and finally I wanted to show you what it
does<00:07:41.990> and<00:07:42.530> well<00:07:43.130> it<00:07:43.820> actually<00:07:44.150> does<00:07:44.720> nothing

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
does and well it actually does nothing

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:56.320 
does and well it actually does nothing
useful<00:07:45.440> at<00:07:45.830> all<00:07:47.200> but<00:07:48.200> at<00:07:48.320> least<00:07:48.500> it<00:07:48.710> works<00:07:55.330> so

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.330 
useful at all but at least it works so

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.780 
useful at all but at least it works so
that's<00:07:56.840> it<00:07:57.140> you<00:07:58.070> can<00:07:58.250> find<00:07:58.490> some<00:07:58.760> additional

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.790 
that's it you can find some additional

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.420 
that's it you can find some additional
