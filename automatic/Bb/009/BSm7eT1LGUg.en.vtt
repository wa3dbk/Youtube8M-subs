to<00:02:47.150> say<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.600> most<00:02:48.230> people<00:02:48.380> used<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.830> having

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
to say that most people used to having

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.199 
to say that most people used to having
it<00:02:49.250> at<00:02:49.310> school<00:02:49.489> where<00:02:49.700> it's<00:02:49.790> not<00:02:49.910> actually

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
really that nice definitely without a

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.890 
really that nice definitely without a
shadow<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.190> doubt<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.299> feeling<00:03:05.780> that

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
shadow of a doubt I have a feeling that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.670
