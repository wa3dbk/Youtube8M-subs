00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.570
 Everyone who is looking at oricon style is Imai Michi 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.080
 This is the first time in about six years 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.410
 We will release the original there from the evening to 20may 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 After moving to London 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 It will be about 3 years a but this album is the first original to make in London 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.460
 Become an album 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.380
 This work is 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.950
 I started to work on the theme of such a feeling of excitement 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 It is exciting to say 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.570
 Hey That's right 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.400
 When I was young 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 From around the middle of the era is just 80's 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.810
 Really to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.760
 Masu mellow music 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.210
 For me who came out to Tokyo from the countryside already really 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.420
 It's a village like a jewel box a 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:07.690
 I think it was every day It's Hong 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:14.680
 Many wonderful adults on the way 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.720
 Music we like they show me a lot of dreams really us overflows in a waiting 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.900
 I feel like 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:25.450
 With all that kind of music we were all danced 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:31.390
 It has such a feel 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:34.390
 I think not that I'm sure everyone early in our generation soaked you in the that era 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 But I got to that era 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.600
 Musical 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.350
 It is something that cells are still in our bodies com 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'm breathing and I'm from anywhere anytime soon 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.070
 It's such a feeling is that would be present and active 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.190
 It's since this year 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.400
 After all books and switches are turned on 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:04.150
 Such exciting music 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.150
 We thought that we want to try this time and produced 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:15.740
 If I love those days I can not express well in words, I'm an empty pervert of music 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.240
 A real but still 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.990
 somehow 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.530
 What exciting mind surrendered to the natural music That's why I want to do also incorporate 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530
 I searched 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.020
 What I liked from those days is really Teku it also newly made I do not change much 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.320
 Any 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.630
 Somehow to or for a very new feeling if there are sooo many found in my 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.760
 Such as very nostalgic 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.760
 It is finished in the strange album that feels like that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.270
 But 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:02.990
 It's been here for decades that things like it all the time connected 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:06.040
 It is very happy for me to feel the freshest and so fresh feeling for the music 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.040
 I thought it was 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.770
 Every year since I am Noctuidae not like live 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.060
 I am really surprised that the original album production of the album was the first in six years 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.890
 Though 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.040
 But 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.150
 Three years have passed since I moved to London 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.130
 Surely that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:33.560
 New everyday since I moved to my throat 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.370
 I feel that this whirl made me naturally 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 A natural landscape that is nothing but full of everyday life 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.880
 Gratitude or seriousness 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.950
 Feeling that nothing is common 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.530
 Even though there are many doubts and anxieties, such is the full text 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.900
 Casually 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:00.290
 There there and here included in this album and also me 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.350
 One of the people who go to tomorrow who are living 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.220
 Everyone who listens is probably the same 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.450
 Everyone many pieces 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.860
 I mean companions 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.380
 I will head to the same tomorrow 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.120
 As one of the companions I also this album 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.120
 I feel like I was created 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.040
 In British English 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.940
 The spelling of Kana is English English spelling 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.930
 Say that this color 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:40.400
 I chose the word is really kind of various feelings and various really full of color 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:45.070
 Because it becomes such an album packed with various feelings various sound 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.070
 I put a want now because they become a colorful album 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.490
 You 'll feel like you're spending a mission like this at Mission London 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:57.740
 Such as 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:00.009
 I would be glad if you could listen to it as if you were reading ml from me 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.009
 I will
