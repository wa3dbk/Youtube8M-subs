00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 hello everyone with you service 239 now I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.279
 I will tell you learning a friend that you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.230
 just saw think many know 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.590
 how it is done but for those who do not know 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.300
 i will show exactly how it is done for 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 we start from the usual deck of cards who 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.650
 my hand is small for myself in plain 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.570
 poker size because that's not exactly 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.250
 placed now mentioned take any 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.579
 the card is absolutely him to him jogger here and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 so look thrust it with 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.030
 the other side of the palm i mean take so 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 here are these two fingers and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 make about the palm thinly better to take 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.739
 do not pay the size of a small here and so 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 here we bend corners yes so that was not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 seen here from this side nothing and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.850
 the moment when we are here and so the case for its 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 movement and here these two fingers 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.229
 we bend yes well, more precisely all the four 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 fingers so bend then weakens 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.000
 little finger so she jumped out like this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 and intercept 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.690
 Well, now you need a thumb 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.750
 train you yes to you immediately 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.500
 half nothing like mine and here 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.430
 when we do here bend let go and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:51.600
 take that is what it looks like we don't have 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:57.300
 dad everything and you can do it differently 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 for example, do it like this 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.630
 simplified well thanks for watching
