00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.020
 this new video today we talk about 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.460
 wifi networks created by mac osx then of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 usually when we don't connect to one 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 wi fi network is to access the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.940
 internet connection that usually comes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.400
 provided by a modem or a router 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 while why it is necessary sometimes 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.859
 create a wifi network through our e 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 mac 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.800
 maybe for the breast connected to a way 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.300
 annoying of the end of the possibility 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 wifi connection and we want 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.179
 precisely share the internet with a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.759
 iphone and a device capable of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.480
 connect via a file and then to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.820
 this can be useful for these verses 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 instead if we want for example 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.440
 pass a file through ours 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.539
 device is an application like ad 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 example in stage air that exploits the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.940
 own wifi connection to transfer 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 the files from the device to the mac is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.270
 the devices must be 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 connected to the same wi fi network 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.590
 so if we create the frame recitation 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 mac we can take advantage of this connection 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 also the absence of internet to pass 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.299
 the data precisely from the iPhone ally break 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.860
 so let's start and see a little how it is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.890
 ago it's really very simple just go 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 su seem of wifi press su create 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.780
 network to name the wi fi network between 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 an example for now tutorial is happy 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 I'm connected by cable so the internet 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.729
 will continue to work 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.220
 we select a channel but it does not have 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 importance number we give you and then 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.159
 we can set a key to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.500
 security for example a web 40 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.799
 characters and must be formed by 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.799
 five or ten we try with ciao 1 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.420
 we create our wifi network as 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.860
 you see is creating the connection e 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.159
 let's go with our iphone to see with 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 the network that was created then 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.820
 let's go over the impositions of which he does 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 we choose them test tutorial we insert the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 password each and access as 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.709
 see we are already connected with ours 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 country all those kids we saw 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.420
 how to share your connection 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.580
 ultra also via a wifi network 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.140
 using marco sx the journey in 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.769
 five we see people video 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.769
 Hi everyone
