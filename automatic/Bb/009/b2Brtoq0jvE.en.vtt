00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.330
 leopoldino is a group that 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 has its efforts focused on the livestock 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 cutting and cross-working 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.039
 industrial property has on its properties 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.840
 productive capacity already known 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 through Brazil through his days of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 field and auctions 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.830
 now on the california farm in good water 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 Let's get to know more about this. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 work through who idealizes and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.450
 develops we have the livestock vein 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 that comes from my maternal grandfather 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.629
 the abel terrugi and then continues very 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.969
 strong through my brother had the uncle 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.320
 had a vegetable garden or junior 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.460
 he had a passion for cattle that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 infected the whole family 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.050
 today we are in a differential I think 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.039
 that we are in constant evolution 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 in livestock 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.010
 the producer has to look for an evolution 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 brazil is today the largest producer of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.189
 meat of the world 's largest market player 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.010
 the country that exports the most is the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.409
 that everyone is looking at the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.470
 Brazil, what is Brazil doing? 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 I believe a lot in our livestock but 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.200
 she needs some tools 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 basic 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.229
 When you speak at precocity and you? 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 speak shorten the equation 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.829
 we need some tools 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.610
 fundamental 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.939
 one of them is genetics and another of them 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.229
 would be the nutrition the animal nutrition has 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.970
 with research at 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.090
 never imagined by us as well 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.619
 producers and we need to keep this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.020
 this face more linked with who does 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.049
 research the farmer needs to understand 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.509
 that without research there is no livestock 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.110
 as well as 100 genetics does not exist 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.939
 livestock research investment attributes 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.009
 which translate into growth in the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.200
 agribusiness but the quality that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.149
 leopoldino agriculture has today no 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.730
 is the result of chance with projects 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.350
 sustainable and well-defined partnerships 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.780
 the group achieve results 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.460
 increasingly positive and making themselves 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.510
 This will take care of our environment. 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.700
 best 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.000
 we'll have - we do not need to open 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.930
 areas do not have to open 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.270
 of science is what Brazil needs 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.470
 and I'm very happy with my 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.290
 partners 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.400
 but we will always tighten the industry 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.230
 to bring us new new challenges 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 technologies that can dominate this 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 cycle with better and more with more 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.580
 wisdom 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.550
 the director netto leopoldino also 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.770
 emphasizes partnership and in the face of 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.620
 such investments comments on the 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.230
 performance of technologies that are 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.770
 partnership we calm everything I have some 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.960
 years already the matsuda provides mineral salt 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.140
 since the mothers of these calves 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.840
 the clip for them all the product that the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 People use mineral nutrition to kill 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.600
 which provides us with grazing seeds is 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.450
 an absurd and max is a great partner 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.570
 more than five years and comes 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.940
 helping both the field day in the 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.200
 auction as well as our day-to-day life here 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.240
 inside the farm 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.450
 the products of matsuda we saw 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.040
 great results and that's for sure 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.840
 It's okay to be with us at 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.950
 provide for this by bringing in 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.200
 From home 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.690
 this good profitability that we come 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 having to talk about supplementation 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
 mineral matrix 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.840
 the cattle ranch manager 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.390
 california josé francisco takes us to 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.360
 another area here the use of supplement 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.060
 can reproduce 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.100
 quality that the group seeks and why 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.810
 people began to use an absurd 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.970
 Our index mainly on the farm 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.040
 california insemination that people 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.550
 moves too with cattle by a rock 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.410
 cat of genetic correctness we have a 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.210
 satisfaction with the part of the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.920
 country after we started to use 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.130
 an absurd one that we have 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.840
 the technicians of matsuda a theory of 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.270
 that they accompany us in the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
 part of the field everything then was very 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.640
 satisfying to the part of our staging 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.890
 we got to reach 80 2% on the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.910
 insemination using the products of 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.860
 mark studies 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.250
 we tighten the animals that are 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.640
 in this area of ​​this category to use this 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.730
 and the product is being satisfactorily 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.120
 consumption is between 110 and 120 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.980
 grams with animals and the last people 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.380
 average and after that we started to use 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.740
 this product was too 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.890
 very good and I recommend a person who 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.750
 want to use and get stuck with this 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.580
 staff who are very serious 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.740
 a person who makes up the part of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.230
 management course was we said 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.620
 and it's too good too much. 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.720
 interesting is an absurd congratulations 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.630
 leopoldino farming for work 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.550
 a serious partnership that provides 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.560
 the entire production chain 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.500
 without forgetting that the development 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.520
 sustainable development is the key to 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.430
 activity 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.730
 No, I'm not going to give you a recipe each. 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.740
 its your own environment your farm 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.130
 their particularities 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.400
 We believe in livestock farming. 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.070
 but the cattle ranching in today to do 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.200
 this short cycle to make it happen 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.050
 with the tools that we have 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.080
 we need to transform into farmers 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.490
 I do not see livestock without marriage 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.860
 with agriculture 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.320
 we do not have this tradition of 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.240
 farmers we are starting with 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.760
 so this generation that comes from 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.640
 method my nephew and he is an agronomist 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.610
 of esalq that is very involved today 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.430
 with the agricultural areas and I have 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.669
 sure that we will reach levels 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.380
 much more sustainable with livestock 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.380
 united agriculture 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.780
 We're going to have one besides one 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.650
 best business profitability 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:20.340
 we will have a capacity of 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.380
 do much more in a much smaller space 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.510
 so I think this is the way one 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.120
 way back I think the producer 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.160
 Have to think about it and that's going to 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.840
 alert to new markets in brazil 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.810
 because this will enable us not to 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.970
 to advance more about our forests 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.030
 this is also a differential for the 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.670
 Brazil 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.620
 What Brazil has 63 percent of its 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.240
 area still intact 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.070
 then this is a competitive advantage 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.610
 markets that speak 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.990
 sustainability that speak of something to 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.220
 that we can leave a planet 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.220
 better for future generations
