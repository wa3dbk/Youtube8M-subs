00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
light company ETL 903 f par 64 this is

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.660 
light company ETL 903 f par 64 this is
the<00:00:10.410> flat<00:00:10.740> LED<00:00:11.639> par<00:00:12.000> 64<00:00:12.570> light<00:00:13.370> we're<00:00:14.370> gonna<00:00:14.490> go

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the flat LED par 64 light we're gonna go

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.580 
the flat LED par 64 light we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.820> just<00:00:15.000> show<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.570> size<00:00:16.109> comparison

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
ahead and just show the size comparison

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.790 
ahead and just show the size comparison
by<00:00:16.949> putting<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.880> regular<00:00:18.390> bar<00:00:18.660> 64<00:00:19.230> next<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.680> this

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
by putting a regular bar 64 next to this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.630 
by putting a regular bar 64 next to this
now<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.720> flat<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.830> 64<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
now you can see that the flat part 64 is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.019 
now you can see that the flat part 64 is
much<00:00:27.269> more<00:00:27.539> compact<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.769> has<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.340> dual

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
much more compact it has the dual

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.920 
much more compact it has the dual
bracket<00:00:30.710> here<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.780> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:35.930> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
bracket here and you can see the the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.799 
bracket here and you can see the the
old-style<00:00:37.260> par<00:00:37.649> 64<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.000> flat<00:00:39.210> style<00:00:39.480> par

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
old-style par 64 and the flat style par

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
old-style par 64 and the flat style par
64<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> same<00:00:41.070> amount<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.809> 177<00:00:42.809> LEDs<00:00:44.360> now

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
64 have the same amount of 177 LEDs now

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
64 have the same amount of 177 LEDs now
we<00:00:45.420> don't<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:45.809> need<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.460> old<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we don't really need this old one in the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.590 
we don't really need this old one in the
picture

after<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.350> demonstrated<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.760> gonna

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
after we demonstrated that so I'm gonna

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
after we demonstrated that so I'm gonna
move<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> side<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:52.190> here's<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> good

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
move it to the side now here's the good

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.150 
move it to the side now here's the good
part<00:00:54.410> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.620> see<00:00:55.940> down<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.829> we<00:00:58.829> have

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.240

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
DMX cables in and out of this and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.870 
DMX cables in and out of this and
there's<00:01:05.430> still<00:01:05.700> room<00:01:06.619> for<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.400> bend<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there's still room for it to to bend and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.980 
there's still room for it to to bend and
not<00:01:09.030> bind<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.400> DMX<00:01:11.400> cable<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> power

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
not bind the DMX cable there's a power

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.109 
not bind the DMX cable there's a power
input<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.619> here

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
input right here

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
input right here
to<00:01:15.119> plug<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:19.159> we'll<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:22.130> okay<00:01:23.159> now

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to plug it in we'll do that now okay now

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.300 
to plug it in we'll do that now okay now
the<00:01:23.610> light<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.439> we<00:01:25.439> still<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> same

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the light is on we still have the same

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.359 
the light is on we still have the same
programming<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.360> did<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> previous

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
programming like we did in the previous

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.460 
programming like we did in the previous
LED<00:01:29.369> par<00:01:29.610> 64<00:01:30.210> I'll<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.229> ahead<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
LED par 64 I'll just go ahead and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.850 
LED par 64 I'll just go ahead and
demonstrate<00:01:31.650> some<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.530> all<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
demonstrate some of that now all the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.210 
demonstrate some of that now all the
colors<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> scale<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> 0<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> 10<00:01:37.220> right

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
colors are on a scale of 0 to 10 right

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
colors are on a scale of 0 to 10 right
now<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> representative<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:39.990> R

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
now this is a representative of an R

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280 
now this is a representative of an R
which<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:41.220> red<00:01:41.509> by<00:01:42.509> hitting<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.960> enter

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
which is for red by hitting this enter

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.880 
which is for red by hitting this enter
button<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.329> digit<00:01:46.290> which<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
button we can go to this digit which is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.840 
button we can go to this digit which is
representing<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.759> G<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.540> green<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.579> this<00:01:50.579> one

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
representing a G for green and this one

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.749 
representing a G for green and this one
for<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> B<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.990> blue<00:01:52.189> well<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> notice<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
for a B for blue well you notice that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.060 
for a B for blue well you notice that
they're<00:01:53.909> all<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.090> 10<00:01:54.570> I'll<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.770> through<00:01:55.979> them

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they're all on 10 I'll go through them

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
they're all on 10 I'll go through them
again<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.460> there's<00:01:56.610> red<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.090> 10<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.049> green<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
again so there's red on 10 and green on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.459 
again so there's red on 10 and green on
10<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.680> blue<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> 10<00:01:59.399> if<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.360> adjust<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.110> blue

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
10 and blue on 10 if I adjust the blue

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.060 
10 and blue on 10 if I adjust the blue
and<00:02:02.360> remove<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.810> zero<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:04.799> there's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and remove it down to zero now there's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.930 
and remove it down to zero now there's
no<00:02:05.280> blue<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> light<00:02:07.459> the<00:02:08.459> lights<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:08.910> on

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
no blue in the light the lights are on

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.580 
no blue in the light the lights are on
in<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.360> room

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
in this room

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.430 
in this room
it's<00:02:11.590> daylight<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.340> it's<00:02:12.460> kind<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.730> hard<00:02:12.940> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's daylight so it's kind of hard to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.320 
it's daylight so it's kind of hard to
demonstrate<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> full<00:02:14.770> brightness<00:02:15.070> here<00:02:15.490> but

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
demonstrate the full brightness here but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.510 
demonstrate the full brightness here but
you<00:02:16.960> know<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.410> these<00:02:17.620> Park<00:02:17.980> hands<00:02:18.190> are<00:02:18.340> very

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
you know that these Park hands are very

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.050 
you know that these Park hands are very
bright<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.440> then<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.680> adjust<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.220> red<00:02:21.550> out

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
bright and then if I adjust the red out

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.310 
bright and then if I adjust the red out
now<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.050> have<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.710> green<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.900> see<00:02:25.930> that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
now we have just green you can see that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.560 
now we have just green you can see that
the<00:02:26.440> light<00:02:27.000> shoots<00:02:28.020> very<00:02:29.020> very<00:02:29.380> high<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:30.570> an

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the light shoots very very high as an

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.520 
the light shoots very very high as an
