of course there's government grants

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.190 
of course there's government grants
everywhere<00:02:04.880> nobody<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> clean<00:02:06.360> no<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.079> is

everywhere nobody is clean no one is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.639 
everywhere nobody is clean no one is
innocent<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> but<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.179> theory<00:02:09.599> i'm<00:02:09.989> against

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
innocent so I but in theory i'm against

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
innocent so I but in theory i'm against
the<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.520> nea

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
the the nea

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.800 
the the nea
I<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:13.610> don't<00:02:13.760> think<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> government

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I just don't think that the government

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.940 
I just don't think that the government
should<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.319> business<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.770> picking

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
should be in the business of picking
