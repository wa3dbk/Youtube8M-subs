00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
this video is basically what I'd

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.150 
this video is basically what I'd
consider<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.509> really<00:00:13.049> weak<00:00:13.230> explanation<00:00:13.889> as<00:00:14.130> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
consider a really weak explanation as to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.050 
consider a really weak explanation as to
why<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> haven't<00:00:15.059> really<00:00:15.360> been<00:00:15.450> posting<00:00:15.900> videos

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
why I haven't really been posting videos

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.460 
why I haven't really been posting videos
since<00:00:18.060> obviously<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.660> said<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> last<00:00:19.260> video

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
since obviously I said in the last video

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.029 
since obviously I said in the last video
I'd<00:00:19.920> finish<00:00:20.279> uni<00:00:20.640> which<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:22.039> passed

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
I'd finish uni which I have passed

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.670 
I'd finish uni which I have passed
everything<00:00:23.720> did<00:00:24.720> better<00:00:24.930> than<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.170> pass<00:00:25.380> but

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
everything did better than a pass but

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.210 
everything did better than a pass but
I've<00:00:26.460> finished<00:00:26.730> uni<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.560> main

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
I've finished uni and there are two main

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.400 
I've finished uni and there are two main
reasons<00:00:29.550> why<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> haven't<00:00:30.779> been<00:00:30.960> posting<00:00:31.140> our

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
reasons why I haven't been posting our

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.030 
reasons why I haven't been posting our
videos<00:00:31.850> one<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.120> reasons<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.260> valid

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
videos one of these reasons is a valid

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.750 
videos one of these reasons is a valid
reason<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.300> second<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.590> much<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
reason the second one not so much but

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
reason the second one not so much but
the<00:00:38.910> second<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.660> pretty<00:00:40.590> much<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the second one is pretty much the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
the second one is pretty much the
majority<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.850> major<00:00:45.239> deciding<00:00:45.780> factor<00:00:46.200> as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
majority or the major deciding factor as

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.940 
majority or the major deciding factor as
to<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.860> haven't<00:00:47.340> been<00:00:47.460> putting<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:47.910> videos

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
to why I haven't been putting out videos

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.880 
to why I haven't been putting out videos
so<00:00:49.950> there's<00:00:50.760> hope<00:00:50.850> yet<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.750> stress<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.350> will

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so there's hope yet don't stress i will

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.600 
so there's hope yet don't stress i will
be<00:00:53.129> putting<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.640> videos<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:55.469> basically<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
be putting up videos but basically the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.830 
be putting up videos but basically the
