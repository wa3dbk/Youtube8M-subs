00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.230
 e bay hello to all and we 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.540
 we are today with fishing 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.630
 potato and banana for gameplay 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.369
 on mw3 we are in the company of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.020
 shadows so this is a member of the team 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 orange that you do not necessarily see 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.030
 a lot since bastos simply 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
 there are members of the board who are 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 a little more active than others 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.530
 simply because there are some who are 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 really a youtuber who are thoroughly 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 on their channel that likes to do well 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 the perf and showed themselves their 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.970
 performance and its support has other 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.410
 who like to play quietly 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.630
 show from time to time 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 performances that sometimes do not 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.930
 can not cause their life is real or 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.450
 other so that's it for you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.760
 do not worry I always try time 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.840
 in time 2 2 for those who are a little 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.790
 little less active to show them to you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.050
 still on the on the steam chain 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.580
 to show you that they are still 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 present but me it's out of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.360
 question of forcing them down there 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 falls well you wanted diversity 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 then shadows came to see me and told me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 listen to me hypno I have a lot of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 gameplay on the doubled 3 he had one 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 twenties still aside 1 knowing of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.259
 point at 28.2 side I think he had 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.359
 200 s the cough sakho it is 28 years ago 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.189
 maximum placement it seems to me if I get 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.380
 not deceive 28 or 24 I know more and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.939
 here he had it all aside and then 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 so he told me go take it in if you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.369
 actually wants I have already 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.289
 took 7 gameplay on mw3 that you should 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.539
 see then it's often doubles or 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.969
 triple month bath with weapons 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.159
 known as mp7 at sierre escarres h or 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.439
 other doubles it has with weapons 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.600
 difficult and if not but he has a lot of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.520
 mb with tough weapons or mobs 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.579
 express so here in this case we get 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 found with a very difficult weapon 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.999
 long criticized on us the three 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.709
 not criticize in the sense tchitÃ© but 

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.060
 on the contrary because it was 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.170
 lose the choices more than one by the way 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 that's why I became something 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.209
 no that was the rule but 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.950
 actually it was that it was 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.420
 really a very difficult in the sense 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.160
 where you lose all your duels especially 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.350
 face the ump is xavier or who at 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 nice short run from him 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.830
 had no chance why because 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.990
 by far to move far too much for 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.340
 able to kill an enemy close to the hold 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.050
 years was not big enough to kill 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.000
 an enemy the damage was low 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.520
 the army was unstable finally 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.100
 really 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.590
 had all the negative negatives 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 of a weapon so that it is not 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 used 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.740
 so it was really very complicated they 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.900
 have taken a long time to 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.280
 we make an update is at the end 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.900
 of I do not know how long but 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.240
 after a little time they 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.520
 have finally made an update is there the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.580
 pm 9 became a little bit more 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.380
 playable 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.570
 so it did not become a weapon of phew 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.030
 but we have seen the first 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.290
 raids words to b and c 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.990
 although there were some who 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.040
 had already succeeded with the pm 9.2 early 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.200
 but here you go 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.540
 the update did a little bit of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.250
 good tears but I want to clarify a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 little bit of good and it 's not going well 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.180
 transform saha larvae was not 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.730
 transcendent became really 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.950
 okay but before that was 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.380
 really a horror 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.020
 so that's no idea to tell you if 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.330
 this emotion was realized before or after 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.290
 the update I do not know at all I 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.110
 do not know at all now the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 performance is still there because 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.870
 that as I said it's a weapon 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 difficult it must not be confused with 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.860
 the bnf the bnf which is a weapon 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.950
 secondary is a smaller version 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.470
 of the mp set that I find even more 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.590
 accurate and stable by far than the rb7 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.550
 for the mp 9 may the lp nine here it is 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.770
 do not confuse it with this one 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.520
 since it is good apm new and not 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.900
 the new mp here and so the mp the mp 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.840
 nine that he has in his hands an asthma 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.650
 at present or as you see 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.519
 it's difficult dynamo 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.470
 so in addition to that what is good in 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.450
 the gameplay is we'll say he goes there 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.380
 to have something that is going to be a pity that's 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.910
 that you saw that they are in the process of 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.190
 lose the party they will not succeed in 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.180
 return to the call score to score him he does not 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.100
 can not because he is in the process of 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.590
 try it and mojave the gameplay 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.760
 by the way started on the end all 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.230
 just because he played the three 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.720
 quarters of the video at mp 7 and a 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.580
 blow he just switch on sap and m9 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.169
 he died once or twice and there he has 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.299
 started his series so I went back 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.310
 directly in the thick of things you 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.960
 have seen the gameplay is very 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.669
 very very very very aggressive 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.590
 frankly that's why I took 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.140
 this video among these intel the gameplay 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.820
 by the way he succeeds the rb you saw 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.740
 that he succeeded everything at the end since the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.890
 better look 200 here come from 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.470
 lose the game 2 cents to 171 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.840
 but hey anyway he did it his 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.460
 taf at the level of moa b I think he 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.680
 made you happy it's a full rush 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 it's an aggressive gameplay with a weapon 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.580
 very difficult who is peace m 9 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.960

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.169
 go see his chain that is in the 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.659
