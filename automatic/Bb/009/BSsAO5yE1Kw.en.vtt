see very slowly shining into the strut

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.330 
see very slowly shining into the strut
will<00:02:59.480> be<00:02:59.600> very<00:02:59.900> easy<00:03:00.290> at<00:03:00.560> first<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.130> will<00:03:01.220> get

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
intern strut and the friction gets

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:21.699 
intern strut and the friction gets
higher

on evenly as possible if you over crank
one<00:03:54.000> end<00:03:54.209> or<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.420> other<00:03:54.450> you'll<00:03:54.930> you'll<00:03:55.409> bend

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
one end or the other you'll you'll bend

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.410 
one end or the other you'll you'll bend
the<00:03:56.010> Cutlass<00:03:56.609> bearing<00:03:58.519> around<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.730> edges

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the Cutlass bearing around the edges

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.050 
the Cutlass bearing around the edges
especially<00:04:00.900> as<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.079> get<00:04:01.260> on<00:04:01.879> furthest<00:04:02.879> you

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
especially as you get on furthest you

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.759 
especially as you get on furthest you
want<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.329> be<00:04:03.389> very<00:04:03.629> careful<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.409> apply

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
want to be very careful that you apply

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.140 
want to be very careful that you apply
the<00:04:04.829> pressure<00:04:05.389> evenly<00:04:06.389> on<00:04:07.260> each<00:04:07.409> side<00:04:08.150> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the pressure evenly on each side the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.729 
the pressure evenly on each side the
best<00:04:09.359> way<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.540> do<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.049> reduce<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.530> number

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
best way to do that is reduce the number

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.150 
best way to do that is reduce the number
of<00:04:10.769> turns<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.329> about<00:04:14.090> I'd<00:04:15.090> say<00:04:15.120> 70%<00:04:16.160> in

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
of turns so it's about I'd say 70% in

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.949 
of turns so it's about I'd say 70% in
and<00:04:17.669> that's<00:04:17.820> why<00:04:18.000> I've<00:04:18.090> reduced<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.570> just<00:04:18.750> two

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
and that's why I've reduced to just two

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.990 
and that's why I've reduced to just two
turns<00:04:19.250> when<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.370> gets<00:04:20.549> closer<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:22.190> 85<00:04:23.190> 90<00:04:23.760> I'll

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
turns when it gets closer to 85 90 I'll

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.320 
turns when it gets closer to 85 90 I'll
just<00:04:24.210> do<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.570> turn<00:04:24.810> on<00:04:25.770> each<00:04:25.919> end<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.940> extra

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
just do one turn on each end the extra

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.050 
just do one turn on each end the extra
sure<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.750> we<00:04:27.840> don't<00:04:27.930> put<00:04:28.050> any<00:04:29.060> excess

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
sure that we don't put any excess

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.620 
sure that we don't put any excess
pressure<00:04:30.410> on<00:04:31.410> one<00:04:31.620> side<00:04:31.889> or<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.099> other<00:04:35.630> if

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
pressure on one side or the other if

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.899 
pressure on one side or the other if
you're<00:04:36.750> putting<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.349> last<00:04:37.580> 15<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.729> 10

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
you're putting on the last 15 to 10

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.070 
you're putting on the last 15 to 10
percent<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:40.070> switch<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.310> just<00:04:41.460> doing<00:04:42.080> this

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
percent I switch to just doing this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.689 
percent I switch to just doing this
would<00:04:43.289> actually<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> half<00:04:44.010> turn<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.550> each

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
would actually be a half turn on each

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.800 
would actually be a half turn on each
side<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.800> goes<00:04:46.949> in<00:04:47.099> nice<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.460> evenly<00:04:47.810> you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
side so it goes in nice and evenly you

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.210 
side so it goes in nice and evenly you
should<00:04:48.990> feel<00:04:49.199> some<00:04:49.380> resistance<00:04:49.560> but<00:04:50.099> if

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
should feel some resistance but if

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.670 
should feel some resistance but if
you're<00:04:50.340> really<00:04:50.580> having<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.150> strain<00:04:51.680> we've

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
you're really having the strain we've

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.649 
you're really having the strain we've
either<00:04:52.800> gotten<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.250> little<00:04:53.370> uneven<00:04:53.789> or<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
either gotten a little uneven or the

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.620 
either gotten a little uneven or the
Cutlass<00:04:55.500> bearing<00:04:55.680> wasn't<00:04:56.130> cold<00:04:56.310> enough<00:04:56.630> or

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
Cutlass bearing wasn't cold enough or

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.180 
Cutlass bearing wasn't cold enough or
you<00:04:57.720> didn't<00:04:57.960> lube<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.260> up<00:04:58.349> enough<00:04:58.680> you

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
you didn't lube it up enough you

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.450 
you didn't lube it up enough you
shouldn't<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.729> to<00:05:00.000> be<00:05:01.099> really<00:05:02.099> struggling

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
shouldn't have to be really struggling

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.000 
shouldn't have to be really struggling
to<00:05:02.760> get<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:03.060> in<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.360> should<00:05:03.389> be<00:05:03.720> nice<00:05:04.650> firm

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
to get it in it should be nice firm

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.429 
to get it in it should be nice firm
resistance<00:05:05.780> but<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:06.960> excessive

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:18.170 

probably<00:05:13.439> in<00:05:13.530> about<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.860> last<00:05:14.270> 5%<00:05:17.180> again

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
probably in about the last 5% again

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.619 
probably in about the last 5% again
still<00:05:18.479> just<00:05:18.689> doing<00:05:19.379> half<00:05:20.120> maybe<00:05:21.120> even<00:05:21.300> down<00:05:21.599> to

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
still just doing half maybe even down to

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.850 
still just doing half maybe even down to
a<00:05:21.810> quarter<00:05:22.199> turns<00:05:22.909> keep<00:05:23.909> everything<00:05:24.830> nice<00:05:25.830> and

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
a quarter turns keep everything nice and

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:35.769 
a quarter turns keep everything nice and
even

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.939 

now<00:05:36.779> the<00:05:36.840> bearings<00:05:37.229> all<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.439> way<00:05:37.529> back<00:05:37.740> in

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
now the bearings all the way back in

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.909 
now the bearings all the way back in
beat<00:05:38.490> this<00:05:38.580> way<00:05:38.789> to<00:05:38.849> tell<00:05:39.229> is<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.289> can't<00:05:40.620> turn

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
beat this way to tell is you can't turn

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.589 
beat this way to tell is you can't turn
the<00:05:41.539> bolts<00:05:42.539> anymore<00:05:43.939> so<00:05:44.939> now<00:05:45.029> just<00:05:45.270> back<00:05:45.419> the

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
the bolts anymore so now just back the

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:55.080 
the bolts anymore so now just back the
tool<00:05:45.779> off<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.020> you're<00:05:46.379> all<00:05:46.500> done

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.150 

you
