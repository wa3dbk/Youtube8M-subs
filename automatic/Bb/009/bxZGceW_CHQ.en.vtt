00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.060
 another tutorial to learn how to play this 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.609
 song that is called the malquerida is 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.710
 a very good song has a lyrics 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.259
 very good and the listening state of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.850
 Monday through Friday because my mom sees 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.560
 this novel that is called the malquerida 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.470
 and I've been listening to our 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.450
 song and it made me interesting to 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.970
 make a tutorial about it so 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.950
 let's see the chords that this 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.280
 song and the strum that this 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.280
 song 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.790
 let us begin 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.030
 can our song consists of four 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.660
 basic chords that are re 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.660
 Sun 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.360
 yes minor 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.590
 or if sustained minor and the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.960
 well let me live 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.070
 I'm loving the black door that 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.070
 outside of my house a man 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.960
 good an apology now yes 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.590
 as we said were network 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590
 Sun 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.270
 yes minor 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.270
 and sustained minor 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.500
 in advance an apology because 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.020
 as I already said it was listening to a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.900
 bit noisy because I was playing a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.050
 Mr. outside with his guitar the door 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.050
 black 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.030
 could not explain toxo well what will be 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.360
 the good window I'm going to make a small 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.700
 demonstration 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.760
 and what would this song be like 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 these chords that I just told you and the 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.759
 rhythm of the song its lyrics 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.060
 so in advance I say no 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.540
 I sing very good 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.850
 so be horrified with me even though they are 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.470
 the seconds 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.000
 it's just one 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.170
 a demonstration for what 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 they go guiding 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.310
 he falls asleep 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.930
 I'm going to make it a bit slower for 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:52.280
 that can be guided and see 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:52.280
 it would be sun 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.849
 yes minor 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.069
 again the sun 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.600
 yes minor 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.620
 these chords are repeated throughout the 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.750
 song will not change anything 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.069
 they are the same even in the chorus 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 they also go the same chords 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.930
 in sequences as we have just seen 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.920
 so let's move on to the strumming part 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.920
 of the song 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.220
 well the strumming is very simple I go 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.930
 to go saying in what chords we are and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.610
 in trait that we will be doing traits 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.310
 he himself does not change in absolutely nothing 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.610
 so let's start we position ourselves in 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.610
 net 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.960
 and the strum is the following is below 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:05.760
 2 up down 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.760
 again down 2 up down 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.570
 down 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:23.010
 2 up and down that would be would be heard 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:23.010
 more shade if we go to the sun 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.240
 and we do the same strum down two 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.240
 times up 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.240
 and again down two times up 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:50.860
 we pass thus lower 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:54.999
 and the same strumming and finally we passed 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.949
 to and we do the same thing that 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:59.909
 we did in re in sun 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.909
 and in yes minor 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.680
 and already together it would be more or less like this 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.110
 ah 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.350
 good 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.800
 that is the strumming does not change anything like 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.800
 I said 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.570
 and it goes according to the practice that 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.800
 you practice is nothing 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.800
 complicated can do 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.070
 everyone agrees to taste 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.750
 like to be old trans faster or 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:52.380
 slower paused with blackout as you like 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.380
 two 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.340
 and well this has been all I hope that you

 very good 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:12.990
 and pretty and it's easy to play because 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.409
 has chords very simple chords if 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.069

 songs I do not have any genre in 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.390
