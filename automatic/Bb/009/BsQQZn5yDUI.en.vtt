00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
floating touch works now as we were

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.170 
floating touch works now as we were
playing<00:02:00.979> with<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.369> we<00:02:01.490> noticed<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.030> is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
playing with it we noticed this is

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.389 
playing with it we noticed this is
something<00:02:02.479> well<00:02:02.750> suited<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.500> larger<00:02:04.190> screen

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
something well suited to a larger screen

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.180 
something well suited to a larger screen
device<00:02:05.180> such<00:02:05.420> as<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.720> note<00:02:05.899> 2<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.680> here<00:02:06.950> it

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
device such as the note 2 so here it

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.229 
device such as the note 2 so here it
might<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.520> little<00:02:07.670> difficult<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
might be a little difficult to

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.880 
might be a little difficult to
demonstrate<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.050> but<00:02:09.410> we're<00:02:09.530> going<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:09.860> our

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
demonstrate it but we're going to do our

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.300 
demonstrate it but we're going to do our
best

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
best

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
so if you see here when my finger gets

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.010 
so if you see here when my finger gets
close<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:16.050> highlights<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> blue
