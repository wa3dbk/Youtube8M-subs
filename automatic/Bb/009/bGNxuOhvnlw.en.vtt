00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
works fine I spin it more than once just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.969 
works fine I spin it more than once just

always<00:02:16.799> remove<00:02:17.250> any<00:02:17.870> green<00:02:18.870> stem<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:21.360> shoot

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
always remove any green stem or shoot

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.809 
always remove any green stem or shoot
because<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.739> shows<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.250> garlic<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
because it just shows that the garlic is

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:40.270 
because it just shows that the garlic is
old<00:02:30.769> have<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> little<00:02:32.099> bit<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.340> garlic<00:02:32.640> here

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
this yellow is really young so you don't

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.289 
this yellow is really young so you don't
even<00:02:43.680> need<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.000> you

even need to do it but just so that you

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.080 
even need to do it but just so that you
know<00:02:45.620> typically<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.769> would<00:02:47.099> cut<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.610> quarter<00:02:48.030> of

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970 
know typically I would cut a quarter of
an<00:02:48.180> inch<00:02:48.329> from<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.629> bottom<00:02:48.870> just<00:02:49.379> to<00:02:49.500> trim<00:02:49.799> it

oops there and then the fish sauce is
only<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.629> teaspoon<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.359> sort<00:03:23.689> of<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
only a teaspoon so this is sort of the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.569 
only a teaspoon so this is sort of the
amazing<00:03:24.379> part<00:03:24.650> about<00:03:24.980> stir<00:03:25.340> frying<00:03:27.579> there's

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
amazing part about stir frying there's

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.330 
amazing part about stir frying there's
hardly<00:03:28.969> any<00:03:29.359> ingredients<00:03:30.290> added<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.099> and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
hardly any ingredients added to it and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.129 
hardly any ingredients added to it and
yet<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.670> makes<00:03:31.879> such<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> big<00:03:32.269> difference<00:03:32.599> in

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
yet it makes such a big difference in

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.360 
yet it makes such a big difference in
the<00:03:33.319> end<00:03:33.500> when<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.829> taste<00:03:34.069> it

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
the end when you taste it

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.339 
the end when you taste it
so<00:03:34.639> stir<00:03:34.909> them<00:03:35.090> together<00:03:35.239> because<00:03:35.689> the<00:03:35.989> oyster

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
so stir them together because the oyster

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.500 
so stir them together because the oyster
sauce<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.829> quite<00:03:37.010> thick<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.299> fish<00:03:38.480> sauce

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
sauce is quite thick and the fish sauce

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.319 
sauce is quite thick and the fish sauce
is<00:03:38.959> thin<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> soy<00:03:40.250> sauce<00:03:40.609> and<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.090> want

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
is thin like a soy sauce and you want

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.920 
is thin like a soy sauce and you want
them<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.719> be<00:03:41.980> nicely<00:03:42.980> combined<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.450> that's<00:03:44.659> it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
them to be nicely combined and that's it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.659 
them to be nicely combined and that's it
so<00:03:45.079> we're<00:03:45.200> ready<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:45.530> stir<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.459> can

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
so we're ready to stir it you can

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.460 
so we're ready to stir it you can
definitely<00:03:46.819> use<00:03:47.239> electric<00:03:47.870> or<00:03:48.079> induction

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
definitely use electric or induction

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.190 
definitely use electric or induction
that's<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.639> beauty<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.239> flat<00:03:50.540> bottom<00:03:50.780> wok

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
that's the beauty of the flat bottom wok

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.589 
that's the beauty of the flat bottom wok
that<00:03:51.500> if<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.159> a<00:03:52.250> round<00:03:52.579> bottom<00:03:52.879> wok<00:03:53.299> it's

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
that if it's a round bottom wok it's

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.750 
that if it's a round bottom wok it's
setting<00:03:53.989> on<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.109> wok<00:03:54.470> ring<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.129> wok<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.519> set

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
setting on a wok ring and the wok is set

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.970 
setting on a wok ring and the wok is set
too<00:03:56.120> high<00:03:56.150> from<00:03:56.689> the<00:03:56.840> from<00:03:57.439> the<00:03:57.560> heat<00:03:57.799> to

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
too high from the from the heat to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.420 
too high from the from the heat to
really<00:03:58.129> get<00:03:58.430> hot<00:03:58.669> so<00:03:59.620> I'm<00:04:00.620> never<00:04:00.859> cooked<00:04:01.310> with

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
really get hot so I'm never cooked with

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.610 
really get hot so I'm never cooked with
this<00:04:01.639> stove<00:04:01.969> before<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.290> I'm<00:04:03.409> not<00:04:03.560> sure

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
this stove before so I'm not sure

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.470 
this stove before so I'm not sure
exactly<00:04:04.129> how<00:04:04.459> long<00:04:04.639> it's<00:04:04.819> going<00:04:04.939> to<00:04:05.000> take<00:04:05.120> to

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
exactly how long it's going to take to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.020 
exactly how long it's going to take to
heat<00:04:05.719> up<00:04:05.980> let<00:04:06.980> me<00:04:07.010> make<00:04:07.280> sure<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.489> at<00:04:07.819> its

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
heat up let me make sure it's at its

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.429 
heat up let me make sure it's at its
very<00:04:08.269> hottest<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:11.030> gas<00:04:11.329> stove<00:04:11.719> I<00:04:11.989> would

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
very hottest this gas stove I would

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.709 
very hottest this gas stove I would
predict<00:04:12.889> will<00:04:13.129> take<00:04:13.370> about<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.939> minute<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.689> two

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
predict will take about a minute to two

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.759 
predict will take about a minute to two
minutes<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.430> put<00:04:16.849> my<00:04:17.030> hand<00:04:17.449> about<00:04:18.079> three

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
minutes so I put my hand about three

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.129 
minutes so I put my hand about three
inches<00:04:19.220> from<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.549> bottom<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.120> wok<00:04:20.389> never

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
inches from the bottom of the wok never

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.200 
inches from the bottom of the wok never
touching<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.799> wok<00:04:22.039> and<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.820> should<00:04:23.000> feel<00:04:23.150> like

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
touching the wok and it should feel like

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.290 
touching the wok and it should feel like
a<00:04:23.419> hot<00:04:23.690> radiator<00:04:24.159> and<00:04:25.159> it's<00:04:25.669> starting<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.090> come

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
a hot radiator and it's starting to come

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.670 
a hot radiator and it's starting to come
up<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:26.960> let's<00:04:27.199> do<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.500> water<00:04:27.710> test<00:04:28.039> so<00:04:28.220> you

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
up so let's do the water test so you

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.750 
up so let's do the water test so you
okay<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:32.389> make<00:04:32.659> sure<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:33.320> all<00:04:34.099> the<00:04:34.370> water<00:04:34.580> is

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
okay so make sure that all the water is

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.029 
okay so make sure that all the water is
totally<00:04:35.090> evaporated<00:04:35.630> before<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:36.710> add<00:04:36.889> the

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
totally evaporated before you add the

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.230 
totally evaporated before you add the
oil<00:04:37.190> otherwise<00:04:37.639> you're<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.180> have

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
oil otherwise you're going to have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.870 
oil otherwise you're going to have
spattering<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.169> then<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:39.770> add<00:04:40.070> two

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
spattering and then I add two

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.320 
spattering and then I add two
tablespoons<00:04:41.570> of<00:04:41.750> oil<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.409> I<00:04:42.860> swirl<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:44.060> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
tablespoons of oil and I swirl it in the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.719 
tablespoons of oil and I swirl it in the
side<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.840> wok<00:04:45.849> then<00:04:46.849> I<00:04:46.909> add<00:04:47.240> my<00:04:47.270> garlic<00:04:47.840> and
