00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.250
 I bring nothing more and nothing less than a 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.080
 shark island like that and not just the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.110
 island but turn on a piece of 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.550
 castle here huge and inhale is that 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.890
 I'm very happy because we're almost there 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.919
 ten thousand subscribers I'm super super 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 happy missing just over 200 people already 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.480
 you know I did a live show that I did the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.520
 Saturday today I'm just creating 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.670
 thought I do not know when to upload this video if 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.800
 on Sunday or Monday but it was if the day 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.890
 today is said live in tweets 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.560
 that some of you are sounding and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
 with your permission I will place here this 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.610
 because I'm messing with the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.950
 controls now and well as you can see 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.960
 here we have this piece is the clear one is 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.630
 that is huge and also has a design 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.890
 very nice because of the idea of ​​the turn 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.989
 so then I'm going to do a little 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.030
 review what has been the map that 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.280
 we have the credits of the creator thanks 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.830
 to download 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.310
 was created by 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.290
 wilding bros and the original unit was 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.990
 angel perera 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.250
 and well this map is very, very, very 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.380
 well done 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.060
 it's all a castle in here in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.280
 missing a little bit of lighting that does 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.920
 I see it a little bit dark but you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.710
 they will see it well because I guess I've 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.570
 I raised the brightness in the video but hey 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.610
 as you can see is that it is very very but 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.230
 very well crafted I can not find 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.630
 where to upload but now it is like a 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.920
 sort of throne and I'm going to charge me that 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.180
 but calm that you are not going to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.180
 we appear to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 now 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.680
 ideas good well nothing like guys 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 young who is huge lights come in here 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.729
 with your friends alone as you want and then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610
 he had a great time rsc and mucus 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.229
 I liked it a lot because I do not know the fact 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.990
 that he is on an island in the shape of 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.119
 sharks sounds a very original idea and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.740
 well it's a landmark video like this making a 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.869
 small review and you download it 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.910
 and you will see all the secrets that hidden 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.319
 this map so nothing guys already know 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.239
 what link do I have to have it 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.920
 here still in the description equally a 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.019
 video in which he explained starting with 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 if you do not know and that would be all I'm 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.680
 very happy with the channel with all the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.209
 little things and in the live one that was 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.610
 recorded in tweets mentioned a couple of 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.620
 little things that maybe they want to know 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.329
 about what's coming soon 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.489
 in the channel so I do not expect anything 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.099
 I liked it was seen remember to give line 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.170

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.709
