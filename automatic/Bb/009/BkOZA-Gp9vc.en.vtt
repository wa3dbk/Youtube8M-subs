00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and we were at Gray Eagle California and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.080 
and we were at Gray Eagle California and
we<00:00:08.160> don't<00:00:08.340> know<00:00:08.429> exactly<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.030> gonna

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we don't know exactly what we're gonna

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.280 
we don't know exactly what we're gonna
do<00:00:09.300> here<00:00:09.480> but<00:00:09.630> we<00:00:09.780> brought<00:00:09.960> our<00:00:10.050> mountain

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
do here but we brought our mountain

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.509 
do here but we brought our mountain
bikes<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:11.840> we<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.440> vague<00:00:13.650> idea<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.070> some

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
bikes and we have a vague idea of some

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
bikes and we have a vague idea of some
trails<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> are<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> area<00:00:15.450> already

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
trails that are in the area already

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.769 
trails that are in the area already
we're<00:00:16.800> already<00:00:16.949> lost<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:18.390> see<00:00:18.600> some

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
we're already lost but we we see some

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
we're already lost but we we see some
single<00:00:19.050> track<00:00:19.230> over<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.800> we're<00:00:19.890> gonna<00:00:19.980> go

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
single track over here so we're gonna go

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.849 
single track over here so we're gonna go
mob<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.930> we<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> waterfall<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> map

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
mob it and we see a waterfall on the map

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
mob it and we see a waterfall on the map
so<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.279> probably<00:00:23.400> find<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.789> way<00:00:23.880> there

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
so we can probably find our way there

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.170 
so we can probably find our way there
too<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.490> other<00:00:26.490> than<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.760> we're<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.029> our<00:00:27.150> own

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
too and other than that we're on our own

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.750 
too and other than that we're on our own
so<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.199> might<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> last<00:00:28.769> video<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.730> I
