get<00:00:22.769> too<00:00:22.890> close<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.150> this<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.779> strong<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
get too close to this is really strong I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
get too close to this is really strong I
think<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.920> don't<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.430> constructed

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
think I don't think it's constructed

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.230 
think I don't think it's constructed
playable<00:00:27.779> right<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:29.220> four<00:00:29.490> decks<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.000> EDH

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

commander<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.840> run<00:00:31.019> tribal<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
commander that run tribal this is

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.670 
commander that run tribal this is
ridiculous<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.140> easy<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.559> make

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
ridiculous it's very very easy to make

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.370 
ridiculous it's very very easy to make
this<00:00:34.800> cost<00:00:35.040> two<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.520> three<00:00:35.700> mana<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.380> then

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
this cost two or three mana and then

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.770 
this cost two or three mana and then
your<00:00:37.500> dues<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.010> plus<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:39.629> it's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
your dues get two plus two I think it's

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
your dues get two plus two I think it's
scalable<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.160> color<00:00:41.399> list<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
scalable I like this color list it's a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
scalable I like this color list it's a
way<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.300> convoke<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.899> colorless<00:00:43.320> which

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
way to use convoke and colorless which

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
way to use convoke and colorless which
is<00:00:43.940> there<00:00:44.940> isn't<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.570> ways<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.930> use

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is there isn't a lot of ways to use

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
is there isn't a lot of ways to use
convoking<00:00:46.469> colorless<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
convoking colorless I think and this is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.600 
convoking colorless I think and this is
a<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.510> interesting<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.739> also<00:00:49.890> ties<00:00:50.219> into

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a very interesting one it also ties into

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
a very interesting one it also ties into
the<00:00:50.700> fact<00:00:50.969> we'll<00:00:51.210> see<00:00:51.360> soon<00:00:51.660> pretty<00:00:52.379> sure

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the fact we'll see soon pretty sure

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
the fact we'll see soon pretty sure
there's<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> sliver<00:00:53.399> sub-theme

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
there's going to be a sliver sub-theme

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's going to be a sliver sub-theme
going<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.539> possibly<00:00:55.170> even<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> tribal

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
going on possibly even a tribal

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
going on possibly even a tribal
sub-theme<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.600> card<00:00:57.840> fits

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
sub-theme going on and this card fits

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
sub-theme going on and this card fits
right<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:58.620> sure<00:00:58.859> EDH<00:00:59.190> commander

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
right in so I'm sure EDH commander

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
right in so I'm sure EDH commander
players<00:00:59.730> will<00:00:59.940> love<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.930> where<00:01:01.199> i'm

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
players will love this that's where i'm

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
players will love this that's where i'm
probably<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.550> played<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.570> most

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
probably going to see it played the most

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.609 
probably going to see it played the most
i<00:01:04.019> would<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.880> then<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.720> supposed

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
i would think then we have a supposed

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
i would think then we have a supposed
confirmation<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
confirmation that we're not going to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
confirmation that we're not going to
have<00:01:09.420> liliana<00:01:09.810> vess<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.880> NM<00:01:11.880> 15<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.930> they

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
have liliana vess in NM 15 because they

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
have liliana vess in NM 15 because they
asked<00:01:14.070> mara<00:01:14.250> why<00:01:14.549> can't<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.030> Liana<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
asked mara why can't we have Liana the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.859 
asked mara why can't we have Liana the
veil<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.350> Mara<00:01:17.189> said<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.759> he's<00:01:18.659> too

veil and Mara said because he's too

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230

broken for standard right now this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840 
broken for standard right now this

seems<00:01:31.020> likely<00:01:31.380> based<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.740> past<00:01:31.920> speculation

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
seems likely based on past speculation

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.830 
seems likely based on past speculation
we've<00:01:32.549> had<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> fact<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.240> marrow<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we've had and the fact that marrow is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
we've had and the fact that marrow is
positive<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.799> Liana<00:01:35.130> bells<00:01:35.340> too<00:01:35.549> good<00:01:35.729> right

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
positive that Liana bells too good right

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.440 
positive that Liana bells too good right
now<00:01:36.200> at<00:01:37.200> least<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> moment<00:01:37.890> means<00:01:38.700> she's

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
now at least at the moment means she's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
now at least at the moment means she's
almost<00:01:39.659> definitely<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.439> reprinted<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
almost definitely not be reprinted so I

new Ajani because of the artwork unless

they pasted the artwork on the ultra
carb<00:05:07.510> I<00:05:07.690> doubt<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.170> probably<00:05:08.860> knew<00:05:09.040> and<00:05:09.250> this

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
carb I doubt it probably knew and this

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.450 
carb I doubt it probably knew and this
is<00:05:09.910> probably<00:05:10.480> missa<00:05:11.080> actually<00:05:12.040> it's<00:05:12.160> pretty

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
is probably missa actually it's pretty

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.480 
is probably missa actually it's pretty
much<00:05:12.610> guaranteed<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.210> be<00:05:13.300> Nyssa<00:05:14.280> which<00:05:15.280> means

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
much guaranteed to be Nyssa which means

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.770 
much guaranteed to be Nyssa which means
it<00:05:15.580> may<00:05:15.670> also<00:05:15.790> be<00:05:15.910> like<00:05:16.180> we<00:05:16.300> were<00:05:16.330> referring<00:05:16.750> to

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
it may also be like we were referring to

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.520 
it may also be like we were referring to
there<00:05:16.990> may<00:05:17.080> be<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.230> tribal<00:05:17.710> sub-theme<00:05:18.340> in<00:05:19.530> the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
there may be a tribal sub-theme in the

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.270 
there may be a tribal sub-theme in the
set<00:05:21.100> which<00:05:21.490> I<00:05:21.610> think<00:05:21.820> could<00:05:21.970> be<00:05:22.090> interesting

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
set which I think could be interesting

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.860 
set which I think could be interesting
so<00:05:24.280> we'll<00:05:24.460> have<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.669> see<00:05:24.700> hopefully<00:05:25.030> they<00:05:25.300> give

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
so we'll have to see hopefully they give

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.930 
so we'll have to see hopefully they give
us<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> planeswalker<00:05:26.380> soon<00:05:26.890> at<00:05:27.160> least<00:05:27.220> one<00:05:27.640> so
