forward to this day probably since I was

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.570 
forward to this day probably since I was
about<00:00:15.309> 11<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.830> why<00:00:17.830> what<00:00:18.160> are<00:00:18.250> we<00:00:18.310> going<00:00:18.460> to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
about 11 and why what are we going to

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.790 
about 11 and why what are we going to
see<00:00:18.760> we're<00:00:19.570> gonna<00:00:19.689> see<00:00:19.900> dinosaurs<00:00:20.109> that<00:00:20.680> were

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
see we're gonna see dinosaurs that were

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.120 
see we're gonna see dinosaurs that were
fashioned<00:00:21.340> in<00:00:21.520> the<00:00:21.790> mid-1800s<00:00:22.570> by<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.620> then

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
fashioned in the mid-1800s by the then

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.400 
fashioned in the mid-1800s by the then
leading<00:00:24.730> authority<00:00:25.240> in<00:00:25.270> paleontology<00:00:25.780> who

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
leading authority in paleontology who

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.130 
leading authority in paleontology who
was<00:00:27.190> convinced<00:00:27.940> that<00:00:28.150> dinosaurs<00:00:29.050> were

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
was convinced that dinosaurs were

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.080 
was convinced that dinosaurs were
actually<00:00:29.560> some<00:00:29.770> sort<00:00:29.950> of<00:00:30.100> giant<00:00:30.369> lizards<00:00:30.940> and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
actually some sort of giant lizards and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.880 
actually some sort of giant lizards and
borne<00:00:31.360> overs<00:00:31.660> that<00:00:31.690> wants<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.110> relationship<00:00:32.710> to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
borne overs that wants a relationship to

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.220 
borne overs that wants a relationship to
birds<00:00:33.129> and<00:00:33.730> he<00:00:33.910> actually<00:00:34.059> actively<00:00:34.690> tried<00:00:35.079> to

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
birds and he actually actively tried to

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.489 
birds and he actually actively tried to
seal<00:00:35.710> that<00:00:36.219> relationship<00:00:37.210> to<00:00:37.359> birds<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:38.319> what

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
seal that relationship to birds so what

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.209 
seal that relationship to birds so what
he<00:00:38.620> depicted<00:00:38.949> on<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.280> limited<00:00:40.199> limited

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
he depicted on the limited limited

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.799 
he depicted on the limited limited
ossifies<00:00:42.219> that<00:00:42.399> they<00:00:42.519> had<00:00:42.789> they<00:00:43.539> only<00:00:43.569> had

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
ossifies that they had they only had

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.809 
ossifies that they had they only had
partial<00:00:44.019> skeletons<00:00:44.769> so<00:00:44.920> he<00:00:45.069> tried<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.399> kind<00:00:45.699> of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:45.819 
partial skeletons so he tried to kind of

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.969 
partial skeletons so he tried to kind of
imagine<00:00:46.120> what<00:00:46.839> these<00:00:47.350> animals<00:00:47.530> would<00:00:47.829> look

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
imagine what these animals would look

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.739 
imagine what these animals would look
like<00:00:48.159> with<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.789> rest<00:00:48.909> of<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.089> skeleton<00:00:49.300> Phil

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
like with the rest of the skeleton Phil

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.169 
like with the rest of the skeleton Phil
did<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.170> what<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.710> created<00:00:51.249> looks<00:00:51.850> more

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
did and what it created looks more

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.660 
did and what it created looks more
mammalian<00:00:52.659> than<00:00:53.319> reptilian<00:00:53.979> so<00:00:54.219> I<00:00:54.249> don't<00:00:54.489> I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
mammalian than reptilian so I don't I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.360 
mammalian than reptilian so I don't I
don't<00:00:54.879> know<00:00:55.359> he<00:00:55.929> was<00:00:56.079> all<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.379> extra<00:00:57.069> head

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
don't know he was all that extra head

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.950 
don't know he was all that extra head
anatomy<00:00:57.850> foetus<00:00:58.859> focus<00:00:59.969> okay<00:01:00.999> we'll<00:01:01.780> let<00:01:01.899> you

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
anatomy foetus focus okay we'll let you

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.399 
anatomy foetus focus okay we'll let you
know<00:01:02.079> how<00:01:02.289> we<00:01:02.350> get<00:01:02.530> on

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:32.639 

-<00:01:08.219> yeah<00:01:08.369> beautiful<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.299> our<00:01:09.570> Alex

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.630 

and<00:01:33.649> there<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:33.950> are<00:01:35.020> dinosaurs<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.649> what

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
and there we are dinosaurs and what

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.450 
and there we are dinosaurs and what
seems<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.970> be<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.119> frog

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.719 

let's<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.420> zoom<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> these

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:02:05.130 

not<00:01:49.390> like<00:01:49.600> any<00:01:49.810> dinosaur<00:01:50.350> I've<00:01:50.530> ever<00:01:50.799> seen<00:01:50.979> No

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.620 

after<00:02:05.860> 40<00:02:06.160> years<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.670> disappointed<00:02:07.330> no

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
after 40 years so you disappointed no

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
after 40 years so you disappointed no
I'm<00:02:07.840> not

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I'm not

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.490 
I'm not
the<00:02:09.429> Megalosaurus<00:02:09.789> for<00:02:10.240> example<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.840> actually

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the Megalosaurus for example is actually

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.280 
the Megalosaurus for example is actually
larger<00:02:11.920> than<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.310> expected<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.540> was

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
larger than I expected it to be I was

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.480 
larger than I expected it to be I was
expecting<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.800> everything<00:02:15.160> was<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
expecting that everything was going to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.770 
expecting that everything was going to
be<00:02:15.550> somewhat<00:02:15.910> reduced<00:02:16.270> somebody<00:02:16.660> had

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
be somewhat reduced somebody had

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750 
be somewhat reduced somebody had
actually<00:02:17.080> told<00:02:17.260> me<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.500> they<00:02:17.680> were<00:02:17.830> reduced

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
actually told me that they were reduced

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.480 
actually told me that they were reduced
in<00:02:18.940> size<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.570> don't<00:02:19.750> think<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:21.280> course

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
in size but I don't think so of course

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.280 
in size but I don't think so of course
it's<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.450> terribly<00:02:22.930> wrongly

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
it's a it's it's terribly wrongly

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.880 
it's a it's it's terribly wrongly
depicted<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:25.450> was<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:26.170> was<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.380> theropod

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
depicted this was this was a theropod

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.710 
depicted this was this was a theropod
but<00:02:27.100> they<00:02:27.160> didn't<00:02:27.400> know<00:02:27.550> about<00:02:27.700> theropods<00:02:28.420> yet

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
but they didn't know about theropods yet

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.890 
but they didn't know about theropods yet
so<00:02:29.680> all<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:29.950> had<00:02:30.160> was<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.610> hips<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
so all they had was the hips of this

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.660 
so all they had was the hips of this
thing<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.530> what<00:02:32.950> does<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.220> actually<00:02:33.550> what's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
thing and what does it actually what's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.280 
thing and what does it actually what's
it<00:02:33.820> what's<00:02:33.910> wrong<00:02:34.090> with<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.330> well<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.140> looks

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it what's wrong with it well it looks

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:48.150 
it what's wrong with it well it looks
more<00:02:35.440> like<00:02:35.590> an<00:02:35.709> Allosaurus

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.440 

so<00:02:49.160> are<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.370> saying<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.849> looks<00:02:50.000> more<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.330> at

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so are you saying it looks more like at

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.970 
so are you saying it looks more like at
what<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:53.690> looks<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.319> real<00:02:54.500> life<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.800> would

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
what it it looks in real life it would

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.040 
what it it looks in real life it would
have<00:02:55.099> looked<00:02:55.280> more<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.610> an<00:02:55.730> Allosaurus<00:02:56.120> so

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
have looked more like an Allosaurus so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.509 
have looked more like an Allosaurus so
it<00:02:57.140> would<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.349> walked<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:57.709> two<00:02:57.920> legs<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.340> had

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
it would have walked on two legs and had

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.280 
it would have walked on two legs and had
you<00:02:58.760> know<00:02:58.849> very<00:02:58.879> small<00:02:59.150> arms<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.050> didn't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
you know very small arms and it didn't

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.690 
you know very small arms and it didn't
have<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.590> hump<00:03:00.830> or<00:03:01.040> any<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.400> all<00:03:01.519> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
have that hump or any of that all that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.550 
have that hump or any of that all that
was<00:03:01.849> imagined<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.480> way<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.720> tail<00:03:02.930> drags<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
was imagined the way the tail drags you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.890 
was imagined the way the tail drags you
know<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.769> was<00:03:03.890> wrong<00:03:04.069> too<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.269> he<00:03:05.569> had<00:03:05.690> very

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
know that was wrong too so he had very

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.320 
know that was wrong too so he had very
limited<00:03:06.110> information<00:03:06.560> about<00:03:07.459> reptiles<00:03:08.120> as

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
limited information about reptiles as

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.509 
limited information about reptiles as
you<00:03:08.420> can<00:03:08.569> see<00:03:08.750> he<00:03:08.930> made<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.650> look<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.459> a

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
you can see he made this look like a

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.479 
you can see he made this look like a
mammal<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.120> he<00:03:11.870> depicted<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.410> one<00:03:12.560> point<00:03:12.860> that

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
mammal and he depicted at one point that

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.890 
mammal and he depicted at one point that
these<00:03:13.640> might<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:14.030> been<00:03:14.090> warm-blooded<00:03:14.750> but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
these might have been warm-blooded but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.020 
these might have been warm-blooded but
his<00:03:15.019> extra<00:03:15.500> information<00:03:15.890> was<00:03:16.489> discovered

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
his extra information was discovered

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.660 
his extra information was discovered
they<00:03:17.690> showed<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:17.959> be<00:03:18.170> more<00:03:18.410> bird-like<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.220> he

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
they showed to be more bird-like and he

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.080 
they showed to be more bird-like and he
couldn't<00:03:20.000> he<00:03:20.750> couldn't<00:03:20.950> accept<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.220> transition

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
couldn't he couldn't accept a transition

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.309 
couldn't he couldn't accept a transition
from<00:03:23.780> something<00:03:24.290> like<00:03:24.440> this<00:03:24.819> into<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.849> bird<00:03:26.319> so

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
from something like this into a bird so

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.380 
from something like this into a bird so
he<00:03:27.500> started<00:03:27.860> trying<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.610> create<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:29.030> line

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
he started trying to to create a line

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.920 
he started trying to to create a line
where<00:03:29.660> there<00:03:29.780> wasn't<00:03:30.019> one<00:03:30.849> trying<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:31.880> try<00:03:32.870> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
where there wasn't one trying to try to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.539 
where there wasn't one trying to try to
keep<00:03:33.140> them<00:03:33.349> separate<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.130> he<00:03:34.250> started

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
keep them separate so then he started

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.610 
keep them separate so then he started
arguing<00:03:34.730> against<00:03:35.269> himself<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:36.230> these<00:03:36.440> had

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
arguing against himself that these had

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.130 
arguing against himself that these had
to<00:03:36.650> be<00:03:36.799> sluggish<00:03:37.750> cold-blooded<00:03:38.750> creatures

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
to be sluggish cold-blooded creatures

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.630 
to be sluggish cold-blooded creatures
and<00:03:39.290> he<00:03:39.410> said<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.829> know<00:03:39.890> God<00:03:40.130> would<00:03:40.340> come<00:03:40.489> up

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
and he said you know God would come up

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.449 
and he said you know God would come up
with<00:03:40.760> new<00:03:41.110> editions<00:03:42.110> of<00:03:42.290> creation<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.220> new

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
with new editions of creation the new

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.860 
with new editions of creation the new
creations<00:03:44.030> would<00:03:44.209> be<00:03:44.329> better<00:03:44.569> than<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
creations would be better than the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.960 
creations would be better than the
previous<00:03:45.290> ones<00:03:46.280> it'd<00:03:46.430> be<00:03:46.519> kind<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.730> like<00:03:46.849> oh

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
previous ones it'd be kind of like oh

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.710 
previous ones it'd be kind of like oh
it's<00:03:47.450> not<00:03:47.540> gonna<00:03:47.690> learning<00:03:48.349> exercise<00:03:49.150> or<00:03:50.150> more

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
it's not gonna learning exercise or more

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.180 
it's not gonna learning exercise or more
like<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.959> auto<00:03:51.139> industry<00:03:51.650> where<00:03:51.829> you<00:03:52.010> the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
like the auto industry where you the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.770 
like the auto industry where you the
next<00:03:52.370> decades<00:03:52.760> models<00:03:53.180> are<00:03:53.329> better<00:03:53.510> than<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
next decades models are better than the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
next decades models are better than the
one<00:03:53.930> before<00:03:54.670> apparently<00:03:55.670> God<00:03:56.060> works<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.569> way

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.100 

I<00:04:53.669> think<00:04:54.300> you're<00:04:54.389> gonna<00:04:54.479> have<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.720> take<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> few

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
I think you're gonna have to take a few

00:04:55.110 --> 00:06:08.590 
I think you're gonna have to take a few
more

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.660 

you
