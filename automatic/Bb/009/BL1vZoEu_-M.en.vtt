now the steel bar and the Cannonball are
actually<00:04:07.030> adding<00:04:07.390> not<00:04:08.230> at<00:04:08.409> all<00:04:08.560> time<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.129> guess

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
actually adding not at all time I guess

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.990 
actually adding not at all time I guess
different<00:04:09.760> but<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.150> very<00:04:10.870> very<00:04:11.379> large

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
margin difference right now it's like

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.590 
margin difference right now it's like
420k<00:04:16.150> for<00:04:17.019> every<00:04:17.560> 1k<00:04:17.799> bars<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:18.669> are<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.449> is

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
420k for every 1k bars that are that is

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.580 
420k for every 1k bars that are that is
really<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:21.310> good<00:04:21.459> one<00:04:22.180> drawback

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
really that is really good one drawback

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.260 

yeah<00:04:35.050> they<00:04:35.199> may<00:04:35.380> be<00:04:35.440> when<00:04:36.220> you<00:04:36.310> make<00:04:36.940> steel

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
yeah they may be when you make steel

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.810 
yeah they may be when you make steel
bars<00:04:37.539> it's<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.080> cannonball<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:38.770> really<00:04:39.490> slow

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
bars it's a cannonball it's really slow
