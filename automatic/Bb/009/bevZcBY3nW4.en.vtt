00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.599 
hi this is Michael and this is my review
of<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.060> Tigre<00:00:03.750> power<00:00:04.259> pack<00:00:04.710> specifically

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
of the Tigre power pack specifically

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.629 
of the Tigre power pack specifically
designed<00:00:06.120> for<00:00:06.620> bicycles<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.340> very

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
designed for bicycles this is a very

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.280 
designed for bicycles this is a very
cool<00:00:08.910> thing<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.330> can't<00:00:09.660> wait<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:09.960> show<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.170> to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
cool thing I can't wait to show it to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.860 
cool thing I can't wait to show it to
you<00:00:10.580> here's<00:00:11.580> everything<00:00:11.880> you'll<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.480> first

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you here's everything you'll get first

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.169 
you here's everything you'll get first
of<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.559> battery<00:00:14.130> pack<00:00:14.460> or<00:00:14.730> external

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of all the battery pack or external

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.349 
of all the battery pack or external
battery<00:00:15.619> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.680> basically<00:00:17.250> enclosed<00:00:17.970> in

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
battery this is basically enclosed in

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
battery this is basically enclosed in
rubber<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.590> only<00:00:19.740> opening<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
rubber and the only opening is at the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.920 
rubber and the only opening is at the
end<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.519> 2600<00:00:23.519> milliamp<00:00:23.760> hours<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
end now this is 2600 milliamp hours and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
end now this is 2600 milliamp hours and
what's<00:00:25.500> cool<00:00:25.769> about<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.300> be

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
what's cool about this is that it can be

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.529 
what's cool about this is that it can be
charged<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.400> powering<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.580> device<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
charged and powering a device at the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
charged and powering a device at the
same<00:00:30.779> time<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.679> course<00:00:31.740> that's<00:00:32.130> gonna<00:00:32.279> not<00:00:32.730> be

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
same time of course that's gonna not be

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
same time of course that's gonna not be
such<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> big<00:00:33.690> factor<00:00:33.960> when<00:00:34.320> you're<00:00:34.469> out<00:00:34.620> riding

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
such a big factor when you're out riding

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.420 
such a big factor when you're out riding
but<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.090> may<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.110> need<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:38.250> other

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
but you may have that need in other

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.930 
but you may have that need in other
situations<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> any<00:00:39.750> case<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> battery

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
situations but in any case the battery

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.869 
situations but in any case the battery
pack<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.570> attached<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.649> bike<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.520> means

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
pack is attached to your bike by means

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.080 
pack is attached to your bike by means
of<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.480> assembly<00:00:46.440> piece<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of this assembly piece here so the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
of this assembly piece here so the
battery<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.719> snaps<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> metal<00:00:49.920> end

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
battery just snaps into the metal end

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.360 
battery just snaps into the metal end
which<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> plastic<00:00:51.199> covered<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:53.100> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
which is plastic covered and then this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.209 
which is plastic covered and then this
strap<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.510> go<00:00:54.719> around<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.170> bike<00:00:55.500> frame<00:00:55.860> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
strap will go around your bike frame or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.790 
strap will go around your bike frame or
handlebar<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.030> wherever<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.170> fit<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
handlebar or wherever you can fit it and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.110 
handlebar or wherever you can fit it and
then<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> fit<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.120> very

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
then it just is a fit like this very

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.230 
then it just is a fit like this very
easy<00:01:03.739> now<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.159> fit<00:01:05.460> various<00:01:05.909> sized

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
easy now this will fit various sized

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.950 
easy now this will fit various sized
frames<00:01:06.979> diameters<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.250> 18<00:01:08.820> millimeters<00:01:09.570> up

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
frames diameters from 18 millimeters up

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200 
frames diameters from 18 millimeters up
to<00:01:10.200> 40<00:01:10.590> millimeters<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> quite<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> wide

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to 40 millimeters so it's quite a wide

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.719 
to 40 millimeters so it's quite a wide
variety<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.869> diameters<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.159> should<00:01:14.490> fit<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
variety of diameters it should fit just

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
variety of diameters it should fit just
about<00:01:15.119> any<00:01:15.390> conceivable<00:01:16.259> bike<00:01:16.979> configuration

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
about any conceivable bike configuration

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.300 
about any conceivable bike configuration
that<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> going

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that I can see out there this is going

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.760 
that I can see out there this is going
to<00:01:20.400> install<00:01:20.759> quite<00:01:21.119> easily<00:01:21.420> there's<00:01:22.350> only<00:01:22.530> one

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to install quite easily there's only one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
to install quite easily there's only one
thing<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.400> say<00:01:23.759> though<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.270> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
thing I would like to say though as this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.929 
thing I would like to say though as this
doesn't<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.170> any<00:01:25.380> rubber<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
doesn't have any rubber on it so it it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
doesn't have any rubber on it so it it
can<00:01:27.210> tend<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> slip<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:28.470> although

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
can tend to slip a little bit although

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.460 
can tend to slip a little bit although
the<00:01:29.220> band<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.729> pretty<00:01:29.909> grippy<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:31.049> does<00:01:31.320> not

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the band is pretty grippy this does not

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
the band is pretty grippy this does not
have<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:31.920> protection<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
have any protection so I would get a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.319 
have any protection so I would get a
discarded<00:01:34.409> piece<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.920> inner<00:01:35.280> tube<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:36.119> your

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
discarded piece of inner tube from your

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
discarded piece of inner tube from your
bicycle<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.409> laying<00:01:37.590> around

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
bicycle if you have one laying around

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.920 
bicycle if you have one laying around
cut<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:38.640> piece<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.150> fit<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.630> then

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
cut a little piece to fit that and then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.359 
cut a little piece to fit that and then
that'll<00:01:40.200> give<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.680> more<00:01:40.860> purchase

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that'll give it a little more purchase

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
that'll give it a little more purchase
and<00:01:41.549> protection<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.079> need<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and protection so you just need to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
and protection so you just need to
decide<00:01:43.740> where<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> put<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
decide where you want to put this on

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
decide where you want to put this on
your<00:01:45.030> bike<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.200> top<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:47.100> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
your bike put it on your top to put it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
your bike put it on your top to put it
on<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.490> stem<00:01:47.850> anywhere<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
on your stem anywhere you want that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
on your stem anywhere you want that
makes<00:01:49.380> sense<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.240> simply

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
makes sense and then you just simply

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
makes sense and then you just simply
stretch<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.710> band<00:01:52.950> around<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> tightness

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
stretch the band around to the tightness

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.060 
stretch the band around to the tightness
level<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.930> need<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.350> hold<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> securely

level that you need to hold it securely
into<00:01:56.310> place<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
into place and that's it and then you

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.810 
into place and that's it and then you
simply<00:01:59.159> clip<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.939> battery<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.290> and

different orientation if you need and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.820 
different orientation if you need and
then<00:02:07.619> once<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.789> where<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> need<00:02:09.270> it
