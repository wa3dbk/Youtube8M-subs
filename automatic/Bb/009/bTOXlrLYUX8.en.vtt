IDs and it'd be uncompelled well with
other<00:01:35.159> mods<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.350> blinds<00:01:37.650> again<00:01:38.119> open

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
all of them on there so you don't have

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.270 
all of them on there so you don't have
to<00:03:23.450> watch<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:23.780> video<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:24.380> over<00:03:24.410> again

just<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.880> look<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.209> recipes<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:26.959> just

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
just to look at the recipes you can just

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.860 
just to look at the recipes you can just
switch<00:03:27.440> back<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.680> forth<00:03:27.860> from<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.370> picture

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
switch back and forth from the picture

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.330 
switch back and forth from the picture
so<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.900> can<00:03:30.080> get<00:03:30.230> all<00:03:30.410> different<00:03:30.470> types<00:03:31.100> so

so you can get all different types so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.240 
so you can get all different types so
cut<00:03:31.850> on<00:03:32.000> carpets<00:03:32.840> or<00:03:33.380> different<00:03:33.800> types<00:03:34.010> of
