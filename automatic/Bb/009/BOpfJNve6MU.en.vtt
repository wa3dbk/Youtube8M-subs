 Total 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.880

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.150
 your back can take with you 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.150

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.070
 leave only the tablet or we do a book 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.560
 but some most necessary things are water 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.260
 so on top we will put after that 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.760
 because if there is nothing above 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.800

 all complain about straps too long 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.920
 so we shortened them a bit 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.980
 a little bit and they made such chili 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.170
 mixer thanks to these loops 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.180
