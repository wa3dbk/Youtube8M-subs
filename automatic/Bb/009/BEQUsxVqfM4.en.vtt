00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
this is going to be a math teacher now a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630 
this is going to be a math teacher now a
math<00:00:03.240> teacher<00:00:04.190> might<00:00:05.190> look<00:00:05.339> like<00:00:05.400> an

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
math teacher might look like an

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.099 
math teacher might look like an
absent-minded<00:00:06.029> professor<00:00:06.299> I'm<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.810> little<00:00:06.990> bit

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
absent-minded professor I'm a little bit

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.080 
absent-minded professor I'm a little bit
like<00:00:07.230> an<00:00:07.350> Einstein<00:00:07.770> type<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.700> let's<00:00:08.880> start

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
like an Einstein type so let's start

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.360 
like an Einstein type so let's start
with<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.630> pencil<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.620> let's<00:00:11.040> draw<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> couple

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
with a pencil and let's draw a couple

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.240 
with a pencil and let's draw a couple
shapes<00:00:11.730> again<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.679> have<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> circle<00:00:14.309> shape<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
shapes again I have a circle shape and a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.730 
shapes again I have a circle shape and a
triangular<00:00:17.250> shape<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.590> then<00:00:19.590> some

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
triangular shape like this and then some

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.990 
triangular shape like this and then some
lines<00:00:19.920> coming<00:00:20.130> down<00:00:20.250> that'll<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.640> his<00:00:20.730> legs

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
lines coming down that'll be his legs

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.189 
lines coming down that'll be his legs
now<00:00:21.240> over<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.600> we're<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.050> his

now over here we're going to have his
arm<00:00:22.439> we'll<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.710> writing<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.460> blackboard

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
arm we'll be writing on the blackboard

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.450 
arm we'll be writing on the blackboard
so<00:00:24.869> we'll<00:00:25.019> put<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> line<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so we'll put a line out here and a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.630 
so we'll put a line out here and a
circle<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.000> hand<00:00:27.500> there's<00:00:28.500> other<00:00:28.680> arm<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
circle first hand there's other arm and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.189 
circle first hand there's other arm and
hand<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> peeking<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
hand just kind of peeking out like that

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.400 
hand just kind of peeking out like that
now<00:00:32.040> we'll<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.279> him<00:00:32.520> turned<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.940> well<00:00:33.260> in<00:00:34.260> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
now we'll have him turned as well in a

fingers nothing to it

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.550 
fingers nothing to it
alright<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.420> let's<00:02:39.780> put<00:02:39.989> them<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.140> front<00:02:40.349> of<00:02:40.470> a

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
alright now let's put them in front of a

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.059 
alright now let's put them in front of a
blackboard<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.909> this<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.709> square<00:02:43.709> shape

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
blackboard now this is a square shape

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.250 
blackboard now this is a square shape
but<00:02:44.549> it's<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.150> bent<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.959> little<00:02:45.989> bit

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
but it's going to be bent a little bit

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.690 
but it's going to be bent a little bit
and<00:02:46.410> that's<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.069> being<00:02:47.250> seen<00:02:47.519> in

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and that's because it's being seen in

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.660 
and that's because it's being seen in
perspective<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.840> means<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:50.340> part

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
perspective that means that this part

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.080 
perspective that means that this part
here<00:02:51.079> there's<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.109> little<00:02:52.290> bit<00:02:52.440> longer<00:02:53.430> than

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
here there's a little bit longer than

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.610 
here there's a little bit longer than
this<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:54.629> as<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.079> goes<00:02:55.230> into<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
this because as it goes into the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.380 
this because as it goes into the
distance<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.609> would<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.819> getting<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.239> little

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
distance it would be getting a little

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.780 
distance it would be getting a little
bit<00:02:57.599> shorter<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.109> that's<00:02:58.260> cool<00:02:58.470> perspective

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
bit shorter and that's cool perspective

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.860 
bit shorter and that's cool perspective
even<00:02:59.790> though<00:02:59.879> in<00:02:59.970> reality<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.599> are<00:03:00.629> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
even though in reality there are the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.970 
even though in reality there are the
same<00:03:01.140> lengths<00:03:01.530> they<00:03:02.459> seem<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> little

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
same lengths they seem to get a little

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.710 
same lengths they seem to get a little
smaller<00:03:05.190> when<00:03:05.370> seen<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.549> perspective<00:03:06.060> alright

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
smaller when seen in perspective alright

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.509 
smaller when seen in perspective alright
that's<00:03:06.989> give<00:03:07.140> him<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.440> math<00:03:07.890> problem<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.340> do
