00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.990 

and<00:06:01.830> there<00:06:01.980> were<00:06:02.100> a<00:06:02.130> number<00:06:02.280> of<00:06:02.550> positives

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
and there were a number of positives

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.850 
and there were a number of positives
that<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:04.410> interpretation<00:06:04.650> of<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.190> music

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.219 

yeah<00:06:12.339> it's<00:06:13.059> finding<00:06:13.359> it<00:06:13.449> tough<00:06:13.629> to<00:06:13.839> handle<00:06:13.989> the

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
yeah it's finding it tough to handle the

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:29.820 
yeah it's finding it tough to handle the
jumps<00:06:14.549> particularly<00:06:15.549> on

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
and side by side spin took an age to get

00:06:33.460 --> 00:07:04.010 
and side by side spin took an age to get
together<00:06:37.710> that<00:06:38.710> was<00:06:38.860> good
