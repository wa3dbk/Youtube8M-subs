00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.140
 you do not tell me how we are but it's 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.619
 super good I'm the aunt we were going to play 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.990
 halo 4 does a lot and that does not give them 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.079
 trip and I know it but well we're going to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.630
 make an attempt to scream before 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.849
 anything else I clarify them like 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.190
 I have not been following them for so long 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.170
 It is obvious that I owe a lot of time 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 without playing so if they do little to me 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.120
 I ask you to be patient because 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 they do not do the holidays 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 and less if you do not play a game 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.080
 straight to the pump is amazing and what 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.080
 worse than it is a lake in all the games 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.300
 well we killed each other was good 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.469
 okay 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.469
 and I'm going to god 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.060
 good 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.060
 What's up 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.500
 over here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.780
 also a team are doing us 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.110
 useful that there have been two things 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 perfectly still doing nothing the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.610
 others where demons tornadoes 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.190
 ok and assistance thank you very much 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.430
 to see individual you can go back to kill 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 these 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.550
 let's go let's go 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 although we are already going to the second round 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.270
 one comes here 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.270
 2 here 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.939
 it fills up 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.060
 do not stain good and the other individual that 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.709
 I was doing something to kill the other 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.709
 No the truth 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.220
 ok perfect I'm going 5 the truth I do not know 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.220
 how many deaths have you already 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.130
 and we bring the super intrame the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 very powerful 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.170
 without him he also brought the same weapon 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.490
 true 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 they were calling by listening to 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.090
 benefits 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.159
 the time 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.939
 me and my bad aim really is that 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.939
 more I can not believe 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.000
 look at the list 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.280
 yes 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.410
 I stayed still that you never owe it to 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.180
 do and less when they are staying 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.710
 seeing very very much here nothing 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.720
 who does not reach it to hit 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.820
 although it says good and has died more times 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.140
 of those who killed then if it remains 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.140
 negative do not be surprised 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:56.730
 behind 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.730
 dies well let's cover we crouch 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.040
 here 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.120
 and that one big good hand but then 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 because I shine because I eat 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.930
 disappeared teleported 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.930
 or physical 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.450
 we come to the talk 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.450
 uy 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.660
 today 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.819
 we have 2 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.460
 wearing a helmet 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.590
 good 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.340
 well well well well we're going to 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.340
 hide 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.900
 OK perfect 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.330
 over here 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.450
 It's missing because it does not come 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.260
 let's say holy death took 13 something and 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.260
 first of all 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.690
 do not kill me fucking unhappy egg to you 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.960
 but it can not be possible that there is not 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.410
 even if they damage it at least if I should have 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.800
 of having damaged there is the unfortunate 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:43.420
 stole my little brother, well, it was to be expected 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.420
 the truth is that he has stolen our weapon 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.970
 and there 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.330
 there we see it badly to take wind from 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.330
 scissors 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.700
 In Stock and I almost killed by 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.700
 what 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.800
 today 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.380
 that is, they are going to win 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.640
 they will win and I feel that we are 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.640
 playing well all areas 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.199
 you can not win 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:38.310
 iway out with all team or that nothing 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.660
 he alone more 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.500
 surely I died a lot I'm almost sure 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.870
 but I hope you liked it 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.689
 say it if you want more gameplays of this 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.330
 I said and I 4 with all the taste this 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.610
 the truth is I'm super not for halo 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.039
 but good joke is to have fun 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.349
 have fun too 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.839
 because it was already fair to climb them pulled and 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:04.749
 let's see how many times I died without dying 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:07.419
 a good and six times more than what the 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:10.389
 five times good x good I hope that you 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:14.819
 I liked it, I wish I was like it 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.819
 please please and see you bye
