00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
really messy so I think next time I'm
going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> plastic<00:01:40.799> bag<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.189> wrap

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going to use a plastic bag to wrap

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.700 
going to use a plastic bag to wrap
around<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.909> oil<00:01:42.150> filter<00:01:42.600> before<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> unscrew

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
around the oil filter before I unscrew

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.639 
around the oil filter before I unscrew
it<00:01:44.630> by<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.689> time<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> should<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.619> least

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it by this time you should be at least

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
it by this time you should be at least
on<00:01:46.920> your<00:01:47.100> second<00:01:47.460> beer<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> won't<00:01:48.149> really

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
on your second beer so you won't really

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.050 
on your second beer so you won't really
care<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> mess<00:01:49.079> too<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:50.790> course

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
care about the mess too much of course

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.100 
care about the mess too much of course
you<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.450> sure<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.899> catch

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
basin is right underneath to catch all

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.780 
basin is right underneath to catch all
the<00:01:54.090> oil<00:01:54.740> once<00:01:55.740> everything<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.490> drained

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
new filter I don't know why I use the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.059 
new filter I don't know why I use the
filter<00:02:25.660> wrench<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.379> guess<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.769> was<00:02:26.890> pretty

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
filter wrench here I guess I was pretty

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.789 
filter wrench here I guess I was pretty
lubed<00:02:27.340> up<00:02:27.459> myself<00:02:27.879> by<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.269> point

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
lubed up myself by this point

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.059 
lubed up myself by this point
okely-dokely<00:02:29.799> then<00:02:30.549> get<00:02:30.849> on<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:32.069> uncap

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that engine oil cap thing on top there

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.559 
that engine oil cap thing on top there
stick<00:02:38.349> a<00:02:38.379> funnel<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.129> there<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:40.540> ahead

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
stick a funnel on in there and go ahead

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.839

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
would recommend not adding the whole

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.229 
would recommend not adding the whole
container<00:02:44.860> at<00:02:45.069> once<00:02:45.310> try<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.730> leave<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> little

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
container at once try to leave a little

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.640 
container at once try to leave a little
bit<00:02:46.390> behind<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.019> can<00:02:47.260> check<00:02:47.440> your<00:02:47.620> oil

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
bit behind so you can check your oil

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.289 
bit behind so you can check your oil
level<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.489> don't<00:02:48.670> want<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> risk<00:02:49.000> over

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
level you don't want to risk over

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.400 
level you don't want to risk over
filling<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> otherwise<00:02:49.989> you're<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.200> going

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
filling it otherwise you're just going

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.630

to<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.709> get<00:02:50.860> back<00:02:50.890> down<00:02:51.190> there<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.519> pull

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
to have to get back down there and pull

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.940 
to have to get back down there and pull
that<00:02:51.670> plug<00:02:51.940> again<00:02:52.319> monitor<00:02:53.319> your<00:02:53.530> oil<00:02:53.709> level
