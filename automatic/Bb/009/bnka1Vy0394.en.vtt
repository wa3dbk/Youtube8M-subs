 today we'll talk about beatings with lumping 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.920
 pyramid 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.700
 it often happens that after the initial strike 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.320
 the pyramid is not broken and so 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.220
 to get an open position for 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.739
 series 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.960

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.930
 from which it is convenient to serve the pyramid 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.180

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.550
 with your ball so alien ball for a start 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.610
 we will deal with strikes with sharp pick 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.930
 long side it is convenient to do when 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.930
 I have a stranger enough for her 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.270
 and those let's look at the stock from 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.270
 short side 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.380
 if cutting enough we can fix 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.380
 it's screw 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 Now let's look at a to

 actually for the selection of the pyramid of aging 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.770
 collection there is absolutely not necessary for us 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.890
 also excellent pyramid selection 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.890
 balls are obtained mid 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.870
 get a good 1 pyramid can 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.820
 kick across the table other 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.750
 direction though such strokes of course 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.750
 harder to control 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.430
 and finally one little trick 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.080
 if you train yourself then 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.449
 absolutely not take on bet every 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:36.639
 once the whole pyramid of balls can be instead 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:40.259
 of this just use a triangle with 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.259
