00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.540
 prudent 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.940
 to attend is to listen attentively pay attention to be willing to serve 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.620
 There are people that when the client arrives he pretends he has not seen and elbow is 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.160
 whose arms you ignore 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.370
 with the impression that the customer treats the company disdainfully 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.900
 that you do not want to answer 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.940

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.790
