 browser and bluff 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.419
 so my blush and a little bit and bet 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.350
 today I can only say to 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.880
 what do I think it shows 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.090
 it's a little bit high I found 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.070
 than that to mathieu well with the with the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.780
 bounder 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.760
 here and I did a little bit my 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.230
 eyebrows off game not it shows but I 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.080
 did them a little they are they are 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.940
 darker than usual 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.750
 françois must see himself more or less and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.840
 I used the big moment of home 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.640
 benefit in light tints this is for 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.500
 do a little bit fill them up a little bit 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.540
 head of the eyebrows the key then the tip 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.160
 west and eyebrows a little darker 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.180
 that to be good tiles I do not think 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.350
 not all the time doing it but it's 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.090
 true that it redraws a little bit the 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.140
 look and then there maybe that 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.850
 change a bit what I changed 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:31.010
 my glasses that can I can my face 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.780
 may seem a little different I 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.200
 will show you as usual in 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.210
 the mirror the holding of plain foot and 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.290
 here for the outfit so the little shorts 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.670
 short 1 are getting to know me 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.060
 so what's nice with this strong is 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.150
 on the sides you see the lace of 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.260
 two sides here too and that's it 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.810
 really very pretty i like a lot 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.860
 this little lace I find that 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.420
 really nice 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.880
 it is a little torn effect 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.400
 this is a host country so with the 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.300
 little sandals 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.370
 they are very pretty really very pretty 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.070
 the strong and therefore the top that I wear from 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.540
 way asymmetrically clay and 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.600
 either on the hands I try not to 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.620
 hide so here's for the little top he 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.990
 is really nice 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.240
 after you can wear like that but 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.230
 it's a little too laid back me 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.760
 I still like a little bit 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:34.850
 a little bit a little bit so here you go 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:38.000

 contract a c for if we had not 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.440
 and knowing how to work them is an outfit 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.270
 a little laid back you are on the edge of 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.690
 sea ​​me I live on an island a must not 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.660
