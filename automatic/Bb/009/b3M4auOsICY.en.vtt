hi<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.000> VDI<00:00:03.659> 94<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.400> just<00:00:05.700> completed

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
hi this is a VDI 94 and I just completed

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.960 
hi this is a VDI 94 and I just completed
another<00:00:07.259> project<00:00:07.620> I'd<00:00:08.130> like<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> share<00:00:08.820> with

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
another project I'd like to share with

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.660 
another project I'd like to share with
us<00:00:09.620> what<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> lunar<00:00:12.300> lander

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
us what we have here is a lunar lander

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.939 
us what we have here is a lunar lander
which<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.880> built<00:00:15.599> entirely<00:00:16.080> with<00:00:17.000> paper<00:00:18.000> clips

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
which is built entirely with paper clips

at<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> top<00:00:20.160> here<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.289> slow-mo<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.590> think

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
at the top here I have a slow-mo I think

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.720 
at the top here I have a slow-mo I think
it's<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.699> 4d<00:00:24.210> sound<00:00:25.140> module<00:00:25.680> which<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.099> preloaded

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
it's a 4d sound module which I preloaded

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.349 
it's a 4d sound module which I preloaded
with<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> bunch<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:28.250> NASA<00:00:29.250> sound<00:00:29.849> clips<00:00:30.119> from

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
with a bunch of NASA sound clips from

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.120 
with a bunch of NASA sound clips from
from<00:00:31.289> past<00:00:31.830> Apollo<00:00:32.700> missions<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> got

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
from past Apollo missions I think I got

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520 
from past Apollo missions I think I got
them<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.460> NASA<00:00:35.760> website<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:37.110> exactly

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
them from the NASA website not exactly

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.650 
them from the NASA website not exactly
sure<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:39.110> at<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> bottom<00:00:41.270> here<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
sure on that at the bottom here there is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380 
sure on that at the bottom here there is
a<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.079> dome<00:00:43.379> speaker<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.700> guess

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
a a dome speaker which I guess

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
a a dome speaker which I guess
represents<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> thruster<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:49.789> just<00:00:50.789> for

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
represents the thruster and just for

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.180 
represents the thruster and just for
show<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> body<00:00:52.559> covered<00:00:53.100> with
