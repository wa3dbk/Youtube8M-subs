00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.360
 in this video is I want to show how to read and use some milk cans 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:13.959
 i 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.910
 day to day week 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.749
 of accumulating and may have the same will be possible 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.539
 just cut them the top part and these boats 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.329
 use them by putting us in a plastic box that I have where I had a lot 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.850
 rummage of my things and things like and stationery as you can see in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.840
 computer and in this case also use to put them caddiz and two 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.030
 loaders 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.200
 and cell phones and devices 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.230
 I have but you have already ordered and they are not resolved 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.300
 another project that I want to show you because I also made some baskets 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 curse an ear on the top of the boat munished on them 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.390
 and then the core using the papier-mâché technique 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.290
 which is basically using craft glue 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.090
 and dilute it with a little water or a quarter of water 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.440
 vigo 13 3% compared to what she did with her on the letter 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.080
 and then he adds that he dried 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.780
 impose another tent with elle paper 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.680
 kitchen 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 it is also cut into pieces and then imposed with 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.450
 resistol the layer as without getting wet is acquiring moon has given a better 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.020
 texture 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.860
 already after this is well dry you can put 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.230
 a set with 4 percent in this case that show the nails as 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.969
 stay with a single newspaper 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.310
 It is important to cooperate with the kitchen paper why not better finished and 

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:45.840
 prevents it from getting up 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 min 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.540
 it's another way to get profitable 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.920
 these boats 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.340
 is that same work but now instead of two boats use 4 in this one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 it was a basket type 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.790
 I also liked the studio used a floor in the bathroom is like 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.490
 I have several products 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.289
 in another action is also to use them carrying 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.799
 the top part and then a part of what is 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.729
 up staying in this way 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.999
 that can also be another basket to tackle accessories things what 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:20.399
 one have 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.009
 first only with a hard stage and 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.259
 then I tape them this age tape ni 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.639
 said reid is better 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.659
 sealed 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.659
 and if the '9' 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.260
 that stand out 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 qi using the same technique very good newspaper stalls 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.389
 I finished fifth so much 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.219
 and this basket 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.650
 and I follow another design but instead of using two cans uce 4 also appears 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.629
 practice given that it's also in the bathroom 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.119
 I have several things 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.599
 I need to have at hand and they are with one foot I hope that is dying 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.759
 say to you too and we help recycle as much as we can 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.999
 scream of consumerism has recycling as much as you can focusing the 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.469
 many plastics which is what takes longer 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.189
 Endesa well 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:13.700
 I'm very good greetings 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.389
 i 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.480
