really really carefully several times

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.600 
really really carefully several times
make<00:01:48.299> sure<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.340> making<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> or

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
make sure that you're not making it or

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
make sure that you're not making it or
making<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.350> edges<00:01:52.640> too<00:01:53.640> sharp<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> too

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
making these edges too sharp and too

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.469 
making these edges too sharp and too
thin<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.680> Nick<00:01:56.329> when<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
thin because they will Nick when you

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740 
thin because they will Nick when you
blend<00:01:57.750> something<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.469> hard<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.570> then<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
blend something really hard and then you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.820 
blend something really hard and then you
end<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.759> metal<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
end up with metal in the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.790 
end up with metal in the
in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.190> food<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.660> when<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.320> do<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.620> be

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
in the food so when you do that be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.219 
in the food so when you do that be
careful<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.790> okay<00:02:08.180> let's<00:02:08.390> install<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.020> again

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
careful so okay let's install it again

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.110 
careful so okay let's install it again
let's<00:02:10.070> assume<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.729> replacement

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
let's assume this is the replacement

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.570 
let's assume this is the replacement
plate<00:02:11.570> or<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.110> have<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.410> cleaned<00:02:12.710> you<00:02:13.280> put<00:02:13.490> it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
plate or you have it cleaned you put it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.320 
plate or you have it cleaned you put it
in<00:02:13.730> here

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
in here

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.840 
in here
you<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.290> these<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:15.710> cutouts<00:02:16.100> here<00:02:16.520> make

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
you see these little cutouts here make

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.430 
you see these little cutouts here make
sure<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.180> they<00:02:17.330> line<00:02:17.570> up<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.080> blade

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
