hey<00:00:01.439> guys<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:01.949> jay<00:00:02.100> roe<00:00:02.340> i'm<00:00:02.550> showing<00:00:03.090> you

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hey guys this is jay roe i'm showing you

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.400 
hey guys this is jay roe i'm showing you
my<00:00:03.360> progress<00:00:05.600> here's<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> light<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:08.220> i've<00:00:08.370> got

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
my progress here's a light that i've got

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.540 
my progress here's a light that i've got
it<00:00:10.410> looks<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.800> might<00:00:10.920> be<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.190> right<00:00:11.429> now

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
it looks like it might be on right now

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.180 
it looks like it might be on right now
but<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.880> not<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:13.469> room<00:00:13.889> lights

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
but it's not as just the room lights

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
but it's not as just the room lights
reflecting<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.340> running<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:18.199> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
reflecting in it that is running to this

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.010 
reflecting in it that is running to this
solid-state<00:00:19.800> relay<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.600> I've<00:00:21.720> cut<00:00:21.900> into

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
solid-state relay you see I've cut into

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.740 
solid-state relay you see I've cut into
the<00:00:22.170> black<00:00:22.380> cable<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.369> that's<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.539> side

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the black cable and that's on this side

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
the black cable and that's on this side
of<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> relay<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:26.010> I've<00:00:26.160> got<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.760> DC

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of the relay and then I've got the DC

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300 
of the relay and then I've got the DC
wires<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.750> side<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.080> relay<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
wires on this side of the relay the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
wires on this side of the relay the
solid-state<00:00:30.000> relay<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.769> need<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> use

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
solid-state relay you don't need to use

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.540 
solid-state relay you don't need to use
a<00:00:32.099> diode

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
a diode

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.580 
a diode
you<00:00:33.239> don't<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.480> using<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:33.899> resistors<00:00:34.380> but

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you don't need using your resistors but

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.010 
you don't need using your resistors but
it's<00:00:34.680> got<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> built<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.160> resistor<00:00:35.610> um<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it's got a built in resistor um you

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's got a built in resistor um you
don't<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> click<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:39.140> normal<00:00:40.140> relay

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
don't get the click of a normal relay

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
don't get the click of a normal relay
but<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.790> these<00:00:42.090> huge<00:00:42.450> terminals

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
but these have these huge terminals

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.930 
but these have these huge terminals
which<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> problems<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.760> was

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
which was one of the problems that I was

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.369 
which was one of the problems that I was
running<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.710> here's<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.890> Arduino

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
running into now here's my Arduino

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.139 
running into now here's my Arduino
that's<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.649> an<00:00:49.950> SMS<00:00:50.100> shield<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.940> proto

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that's got an SMS shield and a proto

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.799 
that's got an SMS shield and a proto
shield<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.629> top<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> breadboard

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
shield on top this is the breadboard

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
shield on top this is the breadboard
with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.520> transistor<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> two<00:00:57.270> two

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
with the transistor this is a two two

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.810 
with the transistor this is a two two
two<00:00:57.719> two<00:00:57.750> generic<00:00:58.530> transistor<00:00:59.750> I<00:01:00.949> have<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> 1k

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
two two generic transistor I have a 1k

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.200 
two two generic transistor I have a 1k
resistor<00:01:04.430> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> base<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
resistor going to the base of the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.910 
resistor going to the base of the
transistor<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> that's<00:01:09.119> how<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.420> set<00:01:09.689> up

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
transistor so that's how that's set up

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.490 
transistor so that's how that's set up
and<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.549> course<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:13.140> code<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and of course this is the the code that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
and of course this is the the code that
you're<00:01:13.619> off<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> front<00:01:14.490> end<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.670> you're

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you're off or the front end that you're

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.649 
you're off or the front end that you're
also<00:01:15.000> familiar<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.570> when<00:01:18.570> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
also familiar with you can see when you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
also familiar with you can see when you
click<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> LED<00:01:19.350> 3<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.130> turns<00:01:20.369> an<00:01:20.490> LED<00:01:20.759> 3<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
click the LED 3 it turns an LED 3 on and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
click the LED 3 it turns an LED 3 on and
off<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:22.290> LED<00:01:23.040> 8<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.640> running<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
off well LED 8 I have running to the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
off well LED 8 I have running to the
transistor<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:25.610> powers<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.759> relay<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
transistor which powers our relay so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.230 
transistor which powers our relay so
when<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.780> click<00:01:28.020> 8<00:01:29.119> light<00:01:30.119> comes<00:01:30.360> on

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.649 

how<00:01:33.750> cool<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.149> see<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
how cool is that you can see on the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.560 
how cool is that you can see on the
relay<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> press<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.939> red<00:01:39.360> light

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
relay when I press it the red light

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.990 
relay when I press it the red light
comes<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.430> read<00:01:41.580> that<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> red

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
comes on I think I read that that red

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
comes on I think I read that that red
light<00:01:42.210> means<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> isolator<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
light means that the up to isolator is

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.210 
light means that the up to isolator is
functioning<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.810> means<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.289> no<00:01:46.470> AC<00:01:46.740> can

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
functioning which means that no AC can

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
functioning which means that no AC can
never<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> DC<00:01:48.240> side<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> that's

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
never get to the DC side so that that's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.050 
never get to the DC side so that that's
a<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.530> where<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> am<00:01:52.890> um<00:01:53.310> one

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
a good thing so that's where I am um one

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.050 
a good thing so that's where I am um one
thing<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:55.850> knew<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.149> forgot<00:01:57.450> about

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
thing that I knew that I forgot about

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.810 
thing that I knew that I forgot about
the<00:02:00.060> Arduino<00:02:00.770> does<00:02:01.770> not<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.460> enough

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the Arduino does not put out enough

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.960 
the Arduino does not put out enough
current<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:04.399> trip<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.929> relay<00:02:07.619> by<00:02:07.860> itself<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
current to trip the relay by itself so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.500 
current to trip the relay by itself so
I've<00:02:09.390> got<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.780> external<00:02:10.410> power<00:02:10.590> supply<00:02:11.510> well

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
I've got this external power supply well

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
I've got this external power supply well
I<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.049> see<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.350> because

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
I don't know if you can see this because

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.729 
I don't know if you can see this because
this<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.860> kind<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.100> cool<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.440> got<00:02:16.590> different

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
this is kind of cool it's got different

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.470 
this is kind of cool it's got different
voltages<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.400> set<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.640> six<00:02:17.880> volt<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.299> now

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
voltages and set to six volt right now

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720 
voltages and set to six volt right now
because<00:02:19.380> obviously<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.220> have<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.549> use<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
because obviously you have to use a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.530 
because obviously you have to use a
separate<00:02:21.060> power<00:02:21.209> supply<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:22.670> actually<00:02:23.670> power

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
separate power supply to actually power

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.289 
separate power supply to actually power
the<00:02:24.810> relay<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.709> Arduino<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.310> powering<00:02:26.730> or<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the relay the Arduino is powering or is

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.270 
the relay the Arduino is powering or is
turning<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.080> transistor<00:02:28.769> which<00:02:28.980> allows

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
turning on the transistor which allows

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.759 
turning on the transistor which allows
the<00:02:29.549> external<00:02:29.970> power<00:02:30.090> supply<00:02:30.510> power<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.560> flow

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
the external power supply power to flow

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.890 
the external power supply power to flow
through<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> resistor<00:02:32.840> into<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.140> relay<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
through the resistor into the relay so

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.420 
through the resistor into the relay so
you<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.049> see<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.380> click<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.090> come<00:02:39.090> along<00:02:40.430> I've

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
you can see it click and come along I've

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.259 
you can see it click and come along I've
changed<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> code<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> little<00:02:42.510> bit<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.910> runs<00:02:45.180> a

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
changed the code a little bit it runs a

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.970 
changed the code a little bit it runs a
lot<00:02:45.420> faster<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:46.079> as<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.500> see<00:02:46.560> because

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
lot faster now as you can see because

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.539 
lot faster now as you can see because
I'm<00:02:47.459> using<00:02:47.810> post<00:02:48.810> grade<00:02:49.109> data<00:02:49.920> base<00:02:50.190> instead

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
I'm using post grade data base instead

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.050 
I'm using post grade data base instead

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
anything smaller than a second so if you

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.099 
anything smaller than a second so if you
were<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.280> click<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.810> faster<00:02:57.810> than<00:02:57.959> once

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
were to click that faster than once

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.140 
were to click that faster than once
every<00:02:58.260> second<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.920> would<00:02:59.070> freak<00:02:59.340> out<00:03:02.120> adding<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
every second it would freak out adding a

it doesn't actually function yet
I<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.090> drag<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> box<00:03:10.569> around<00:03:10.980> made<00:03:11.980> that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
I can drag the box around made that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.119 
I can drag the box around made that
using<00:03:12.430> jQuery

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.940 

so<00:03:15.549> that's<00:03:15.909> that's<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.629> now<00:03:16.810> oh<00:03:16.959> oh<00:03:17.769> yeah

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
so that's that's it for now oh oh yeah

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.289 
so that's that's it for now oh oh yeah
there<00:03:18.099> was<00:03:18.220> one<00:03:18.459> other<00:03:18.640> thing<00:03:18.909> that<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.090> wanted

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
there was one other thing that I wanted

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.820 
there was one other thing that I wanted
to<00:03:19.390> show<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.690> this<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:23.280> my<00:03:24.280> iPad<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:26.620> works

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
works on my iPad I have the Droid it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.809 
works on my iPad I have the Droid it
works<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.510> my<00:03:37.629> droid<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.980> that's<00:03:39.400> pretty<00:03:39.640> cool

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
works on my droid so that's pretty cool

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.050 
works on my droid so that's pretty cool
that's<00:03:40.060> that's<00:03:40.420> where<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.599> am<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.670> next<00:03:42.849> thing

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
that's that's where I am the next thing

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.670 
that's that's where I am the next thing
to<00:03:43.150> do<00:03:43.269> we<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.750> put<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.079> Arduino<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.590> a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
to do we have to put the Arduino in a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.550 
to do we have to put the Arduino in a
box<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.549> in<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.209> project<00:03:46.599> box<00:03:46.810> mount<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.319> in<00:03:47.470> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
box and in a project box mount it in a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.520 
box and in a project box mount it in a
closet<00:03:47.769> somewhere<00:03:48.099> run<00:03:48.730> power<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.480> put<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
closet somewhere run power to it put the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.400 
closet somewhere run power to it put the
relay<00:03:50.799> up<00:03:50.950> in<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.190> attic<00:03:51.310> connect<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:53.230> the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
relay up in the attic connect it to the

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.270 
relay up in the attic connect it to the
actual<00:03:54.810> light<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.890> power<00:03:57.370> wire<00:03:59.010> that's<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.159> good

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
actual light of power wire that's a good

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.190 
actual light of power wire that's a good
ways<00:04:00.459> down<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> road<00:04:00.819> though<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.420> this<00:04:01.989> is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
ways down the road though but this is

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.229 
ways down the road though but this is
this<00:04:02.440> is<00:04:02.650> really<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.519> milestone<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.180> I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
this is really the milestone that I

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.729 
this is really the milestone that I
wanted<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.629> get<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.810> is<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.290> be<00:04:05.440> able<00:04:05.620> to

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
wanted to get to is to be able to

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.690 
wanted to get to is to be able to
control<00:04:06.190> AC<00:04:06.489> current<00:04:07.150> with<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.720> Arduino

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
control AC current with the Arduino

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.949 
control AC current with the Arduino
