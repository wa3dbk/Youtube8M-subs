00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
that and I'm also going to be installing

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
that and I'm also going to be installing
more<00:00:53.820> glyphs<00:00:54.059> too<00:00:54.390> many<00:00:54.600> items<00:00:54.899> mod<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.949> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
more glyphs too many items mod so that I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
more glyphs too many items mod so that I
can<00:00:56.039> prove<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.699> mod<00:00:56.910> isn't<00:00:57.239> fat<00:00:57.390> working

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
can prove that the mod isn't fat working

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.169 
can prove that the mod isn't fat working
but<00:00:58.530> before<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.160> anything<00:00:59.399> before<00:00:59.999> you

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
but before you do anything before you

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.340 
but before you do anything before you
even<00:01:00.239> start<00:01:00.510> downloading<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
even start downloading you're going to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.820 
even start downloading you're going to
want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.589> clear<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.190> minecraft

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
basically if you've had other mods and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.280 
basically if you've had other mods and
solder<00:01:06.330> stuff<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.780> might<00:01:07.050> not<00:01:07.230> be

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
solder stuff they might not be

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
solder stuff they might not be
compatible<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.400> mod<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.909> might<00:01:09.090> cause

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
compatible with this mod and might cause

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810

issues<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.800> these<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
issues so these this way to do this is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.110
