00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello friends and friends I will teach you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.380
 another culinary technique of fish up 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.110
 now he had seen some techniques with 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.929
 hake with sea bass etc. today I am going to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 show how you can do a few 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.210
 fillets 16 kallop in salmon for this 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.950
 I will use a tail and I will say 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 How is it 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.550
 we started from the back 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.790
 we fix well where is more or less the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.990
 half of the salmon and we're hitting 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:37.010
 the skin we stick to the thorn 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.010
 we are opening 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.090
 In this way, this is not done by the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.850
 fishmonger but if you want to do it in 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.730
 house you can also do 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.170
 we try to stick enough to the skin 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.820
 they hit the thorn 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.820
 and sliding the knife in this way 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.159
 and we cut it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.929
 by the counter 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.259
 we remove this part here this part of 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.259
 Skirt 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.590
 the part that does not 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.590
 of a little woman 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.180
 and well then what we do is let's say 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.940
 detach the skin by gluing them well but 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.900
 his golazo 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.900
 with movements 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.549
 from left to right 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.549
 power and low depending on how you look 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 once we have defended the skin 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.399
 and we have the fish 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.399
 prepared 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.710
 to make steps 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 this part of the queue usually does not 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.660
 only have thorns the top 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.150
 if you are the fabric thorns with you here to 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.490
 Sometimes we can find the same 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.229
 finger we are playing by this part by 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.820
 this area and we see in some thorn here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.930
 for example we see that it has a 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.700
 we remove with great care 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.560
 this part there is a thorn 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.390
 and the good thing, then you can start cutting 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.489
 around here as I mentioned it, the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.470
 smoked salmon what I'm going to do is 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.360
 leave this part of the tail for another 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.380
 thing and start cutting from here 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.380
 and in this way 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.019
 finite escalopes to do to the 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.019
 griddle 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.050
 and try to be more or less have the 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.130
 same size 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.750
 thick I mean 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.600
 You can use this knife or a 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.020
 knife a transel knife to one of 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.020
 fine point 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.950
 this has made the iron as children 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.120
 or as very well at least 2000 the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.690
 mine 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.310
 they love salmon like that because it's what 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.420
 as they say 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.420
 almost no fish 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 well this is a way to cut 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.110
 salmon scallops as you see 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.170
 it's a very quick way to cook them 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.060
 a recipe that I recently put with 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.819
 mushrooms because I was carrying this kind of 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.349
 culinary procedure 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.800
 and like everything else, it's a matter of 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.070
 to practice 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.740
 and well you know if you have any questions 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.800
 or you want to consult me ​​something I will leave 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.600
 of this my page a greeting for all and
