00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
idea is pleased to finish rot rather

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.910 
idea is pleased to finish rot rather
than<00:00:53.750> starting<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.620> there<00:00:54.950> no<00:00:56.470> we<00:00:57.470> want

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
this warp takes takes two hours so the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.850 
this warp takes takes two hours so the
the<00:01:07.040> general<00:01:07.280> speed<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:09.080> line<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.650> that

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
the general speed of this line and that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.390 
the general speed of this line and that
line<00:01:09.890> because<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:11.119> two<00:01:11.360> hours<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.869> do<00:01:12.400> more

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
line because it's two hours to do more

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.540 
line because it's two hours to do more
or<00:01:13.490> less<00:01:13.670> one<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.180> half<00:01:14.360> kilometres<00:01:15.550> so

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
or less one and a half kilometres so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.900 
or less one and a half kilometres so
that<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.970> speed<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.479> we're<00:01:17.720> walking<00:01:18.140> at<00:01:18.290> is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
that the speed that we're walking at is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.370 
that the speed that we're walking at is
just<00:01:19.910> about<00:01:20.180> something<00:01:20.750> like<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.350> to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
just about something like this so to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.999 
just about something like this so to
speak

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.230 

so<00:01:30.409> they<00:01:31.409> say<00:01:31.619> well<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.100> white<00:01:32.399> why<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so they say well what white why do this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
so they say well what white why do this
what's<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> point<00:01:33.899> of<00:01:34.140> us<00:01:34.259> what's<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.649> point

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
what's the point of us what's the point

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
what's the point of us what's the point
to<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> mansion<00:01:35.549> question<00:01:36.000> why<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.509> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to the mansion question why do this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.070 
to the mansion question why do this
what's<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> point<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> point<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
what's the point the point is for the

what's the point the point is for the
experience<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:42.320> because<00:01:43.850> if<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.450> say

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
experience of it because if I if I say

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.260 
experience of it because if I if I say
when<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> last<00:01:47.340> time<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.789> made<00:01:48.060> this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.540 
or it's not a giant for
so<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> kind<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.900> human<00:02:46.590> communal

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
so it is a kind of human communal

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.809 
so it is a kind of human communal
experience<00:02:49.190> what<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.519> want<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
experience what we don't want is so that

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.180 
experience what we don't want is so that
some<00:02:54.060> people<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.810> mentor<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.980> next

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
some people have one mentor and the next

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.160 
some people have one mentor and the next
person<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.580> five<00:02:57.209> meters<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.780> think<00:03:00.780> it's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
person is five meters so you think it's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.880 
person is five meters so you think it's
a<00:03:01.290> very<00:03:01.560> good<00:03:01.709> opportunity<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:03.049> daydream<00:03:04.049> but

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
a very good opportunity to daydream but

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.949 
a very good opportunity to daydream but
really<00:03:07.790> watching<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:09.209> meter<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.810> whole

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
really watching this one meter the whole

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.979 
really watching this one meter the whole
way<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.410> two<00:03:10.590> hours<00:03:10.849> so<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.970> person<00:03:12.330> may<00:03:12.510> go

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
way for two hours so the person may go

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.970 
way for two hours so the person may go
slow<00:03:13.440> or<00:03:13.799> then<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.160> speed<00:03:14.610> up<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.680> seems

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
slow or then they speed up so it seems

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.589 
slow or then they speed up so it seems
like<00:03:17.099> there's<00:03:17.430> very<00:03:17.459> little<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.269> but<00:03:18.480> in

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
like there's very little to do but in

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.100 
like there's very little to do but in
another<00:03:18.750> way<00:03:19.910> we'll<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:21.060> concentrating<00:03:21.420> on

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
another way we'll be concentrating on

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.140 
another way we'll be concentrating on
something<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.400> don't<00:03:23.670> normally

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
something that we don't normally

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.800 
something that we don't normally
concentrate<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.370> therefore<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.540> becomes

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
concentrate on so therefore it becomes

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.990 
concentrate on so therefore it becomes
medicine<00:03:28.410> too<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.069> target<00:03:29.280> range

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
medicine too because the target range

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.059 
medicine too because the target range
it's<00:03:30.660> concentrated<00:03:31.049> at<00:03:31.470> two<00:03:31.620> hours<00:03:31.829> to

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
it's concentrated at two hours to

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.580 
it's concentrated at two hours to
maintain<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:33.150> meter<00:03:33.390> between<00:03:33.660> tonight<00:03:34.110> to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
maintain one meter between tonight to

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.030 
maintain one meter between tonight to
