because<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.860> first<00:01:12.100> game<00:01:12.310> did<00:01:12.610> sort<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:12.970> boil

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
because the first game did sort of boil

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260 
because the first game did sort of boil
down<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.510> these<00:01:13.810> pretty<00:01:14.799> repetitive<00:01:15.270> although

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
down to these pretty repetitive although

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.480 
down to these pretty repetitive although
very<00:01:16.600> intense<00:01:17.020> battles<00:01:17.859> against<00:01:18.310> the

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
very intense battles against the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.370 
very intense battles against the
hundreds<00:01:19.060> of<00:01:19.179> monsters<00:01:19.719> at<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.929> same<00:01:20.140> time

hundreds of monsters at the same time
but<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.640> surprising<00:01:22.240> thing<00:01:22.270> about<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
but the surprising thing about the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.719 
but the surprising thing about the
second<00:01:23.109> encounter<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.189> it's<00:01:24.429> even

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
second encounter is that it's even

second encounter is that it's even
better<00:01:25.030> than<00:01:25.179> the<00:01:25.329> first<00:01:25.570> game<00:01:25.899> it's<00:01:26.170> just

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
because of the Doppler shift and it's

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.150 
because of the Doppler shift and it's
just<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.810> much<00:03:59.840> more<00:04:00.849> audacious<00:04:01.849> than

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
just so much more audacious than

all<00:04:07.930> of<00:04:07.960> them<00:04:08.170> are<00:04:08.320> huge<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.950> game<00:04:09.130> is

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
all of them are huge the game is

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.420 
all of them are huge the game is
actually<00:04:09.640> quite<00:04:10.000> long<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.720> longer<00:04:11.200> than<00:04:11.440> most

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
in the last year it'll take you probably

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.789 
in the last year it'll take you probably
about<00:04:16.299> 15<00:04:16.750> hours<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.200> finish<00:04:17.350> the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
single-player game and it's just a total

single-player game and it's just a total
blast<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.680> can't<00:04:20.890> stress<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.190> enough

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
background you could walk right up to it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.550 
background you could walk right up to it
and<00:04:54.790> go<00:04:55.000> inside<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.960> level<00:04:56.140> switch

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
and go inside the level switch

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.380 
and go inside the level switch
seamlessly<00:04:57.280> from<00:04:57.820> indoor<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.360> outdoor

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.690 
seamlessly from indoor to outdoor
environments<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.530> yeah<00:05:00.160> you'll<00:05:00.370> rack<00:05:00.670> up

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
environments and yeah you'll rack up

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.060 
environments and yeah you'll rack up
these<00:05:01.090> gigantic<00:05:01.630> kill<00:05:01.900> counts<00:05:02.320> and<00:05:02.500> it's

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
these gigantic kill counts and it's

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.830 
these gigantic kill counts and it's
really<00:05:03.460> impressive<00:05:03.670> that<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.300> levels<00:05:04.600> are<00:05:04.720> as

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
really impressive that the levels are as

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.570 
really impressive that the levels are as
seamless<00:05:05.230> as<00:05:05.350> they<00:05:05.530> are<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:06.220> quite<00:05:06.550> a

seamless as they are it's quite a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.340 
seamless as they are it's quite a
testament<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.360> technology<00:05:07.930> behind<00:05:08.080> the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
testament to the technology behind the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.590 
testament to the technology behind the
game<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:09.220> audio<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.700> general<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.240> great<00:05:10.480> in

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
game the audio in general is great in

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.090 
game the audio in general is great in
the<00:05:10.660> game<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:11.140> actually<00:05:11.500> have<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.770> keep<00:05:11.950> your

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
the game you actually have to keep your

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.980 
the game you actually have to keep your
ears<00:05:12.310> open<00:05:12.490> as<00:05:12.760> you're<00:05:12.910> playing<00:05:13.060> because<00:05:13.630> you

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
ears open as you're playing because you

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.870 
ears open as you're playing because you
can<00:05:14.170> often<00:05:14.350> hear<00:05:14.770> monsters<00:05:15.280> before<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:15.730> can

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
can often hear monsters before you can

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.300 
can often hear monsters before you can
see<00:05:16.120> them<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:16.450> they<00:05:16.540> all<00:05:17.320> sound<00:05:17.620> different<00:05:18.070> so

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
see them and they all sound different so

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.790 
see them and they all sound different so
during<00:05:19.180> battle<00:05:19.510> you'll<00:05:19.750> have<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.470> listen

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
during battle you'll have to listen

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.500 
during battle you'll have to listen
carefully<00:05:20.830> for<00:05:21.310> what's<00:05:21.790> out<00:05:21.970> there<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.450> you

carefully for what's out there so you

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.659 
carefully for what's out there so you
know<00:05:22.720> what<00:05:22.900> you're<00:05:22.990> up<00:05:23.050> against<00:05:23.560> there's<00:05:24.550> a

know what you're up against there's a

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.790 
know what you're up against there's a
different<00:05:25.390> music<00:05:25.750> track<00:05:25.990> for<00:05:26.230> every<00:05:26.470> level

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
different music track for every level

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.830 
different music track for every level
that<00:05:27.400> fits<00:05:27.669> really<00:05:27.910> well<00:05:28.030> with<00:05:28.630> each

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
that fits really well with each

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.720 
that fits really well with each
respective<00:05:29.410> level<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:29.950> it<00:05:30.040> picks<00:05:30.280> up<00:05:30.460> when

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
respective level and it picks up when

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.850 
respective level and it picks up when
the<00:05:30.880> action<00:05:31.240> heats<00:05:31.450> up<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:32.110> then<00:05:32.260> cools<00:05:32.590> down

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
the action heats up and then cools down

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.280 
the action heats up and then cools down
when<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:34.000> those<00:05:34.210> rare<00:05:34.450> times<00:05:34.510> when<00:05:35.020> you're<00:05:35.169> not
