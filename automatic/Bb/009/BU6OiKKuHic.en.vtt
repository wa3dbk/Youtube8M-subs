00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 Hello everyone guys in this video I tell you 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.500

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.509
 and you know you like these videos 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.490
 so let's start the first thing 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 I took it here such a book for 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 baby of our friends he is not yet 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.380
 one year old a little less than one year old and i like 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.840
 any such children's things in fixed price 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.660
 cubes puzzles I think it's cool for 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.199
 40 what I think is 41 rubles now fix 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.719
 price 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.440
 I think the price is ok and not bad 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 quality 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.770
 books series patchwork tales here 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.149
 you can touch the bear 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.309
 thick pictures i mean baby myself 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.010
 will be able to watch them himself turns over 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.219
 The page will not die anywhere 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.590
 sever does not nibble nibble and of course 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.250
 can and nibbles but in general the book 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.530
 will survive in the hands of a child and very bright and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 very bright look beautiful 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 Pictures 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.769
 I repeat that I like such children 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.100
 here are all sorts of toys books flex press 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.290
 so pay attention to the following 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.010
 that i took these two here such 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.640
 shelves like this this shelf 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.250
 I already have one and very much I 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.530
 I want to say a handy thing I have very 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.439
 high distance in the kitchen and between 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 shelves and really just feel sorry for it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.490
 distance but it disappears nowhere 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 so here are these shelves 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.479
 real salvation is not necessary 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 drill tied set 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.240
 shelf enjoy life in general all this 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.040
 very comfortable it is quite tight 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.630
 they do not crawl on the surface 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.700
 locker and again saves space 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.130
 for example you bottom plate above 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.829
 cups but generally very cool 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 handy thing and I took as much as 2 pieces 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.290
 the next thing, too, for the kitchen is such 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.409
 here are forms from dense foil this forms 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.479
 for baking and very comfortable thing on 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 In fact because you have baked 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.030
 for example some kind of frame or something there 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.670
 still ate and thrown out 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.750
 forms do not need anything we do there with 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.819
 messing about with it 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.430
 very comfortable really especially 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.650
 when guests come I don't know 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.480
 you can like right them together in one 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.060
 for example meat to another side dish 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.150
 here are three things for 41 rubles in my opinion 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.860
 Great price and very comfortable following 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.140
 what I bought and also for the kitchen 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.230
 this foil is ordinary aluminum foil 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.050
 I often use war 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 ends quickly therefore 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.410
 replenishment and the next thing I bought too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.840
 for kitchen 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.570
 these are such paper towels and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.300
 I 'll buy this farm here. 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.110
 why does this roll look like this to me 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.340
 like what they are 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.030
 I hope you will see that they are like 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.640
 such corrugated they though double-layer 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.010
 they absorb very well due to this 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.170
 this one of my relief in general to me 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.440
 I like this towel right here and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.470
 I always take their expression minutes 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.860
 move on to sweets and I took 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.920
 all sorts of different chocolate candy more precisely 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.560
 Saw such here nabchiki this book 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.030
 mars twix 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.370
 each package is so bright one ruble 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.769
 i didn't really know it expensive 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 normal or cheap in my opinion such 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.760
 normal average price seems to me they 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.640
 about the same from the birth fee 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.549
 This amount but the first time I see 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.070
 as asked fireplace such chocolates type a 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.459
 Mars and Twix so I did not take them 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.230
 I love and we will look for the last thing that I tell you 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.900
 I want to show it such a laser 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.870
 for a cat, I already showed it to you 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.000
 he took my mother for me 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.940
 Kitty therefore had to buy a new one 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.790
 I really like that you immediately immediately 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.609
 the cat loves batteries 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.380
 play with such lasers but they wrote to me 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.269
 in the comments one girl pay 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.450
 your attention is by no means impossible 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.090
 shine in the eyes of animals and people in general 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.350
 no one can shine in the eyes because 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.350
 Well, of course it is very harmful 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.310
 and it blinds the animal too 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.840
 play only on the floor or on the walls but 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.600
 this is just in case 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.610
 will not know cats like so much 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.800
 that we will play it all was all mine 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.200
 purchases from fixed price video turned out 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.870
 small so hope you are not tired 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.590
 as you can see most of the ideas were for 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.990
 kitchens 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.520
 I hope you were interested in the video 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.320
