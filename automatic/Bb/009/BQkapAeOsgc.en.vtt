00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
 well once we have finished the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.590
 tape is like this 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.309
 has to finish it and therefore 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.970
 we need needles and white thread or 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.369
 second the one that hits the one of the one 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.770
 light bulb or a pin or what you guys 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.070
 prefer 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.590
 center a piece of cloth equal to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.430
 be able to put it in the center of the gun 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.860
 of the circle 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.440
 good 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.440
 we fold it and join the two parts 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.160
 we put it and therefore we are going to 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.870
 proceed to join them 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.590
 And I do 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 and we want 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.200
 it does not have to be perfect because 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.180
 you see 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.400
 like this after I covered it with the strip 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.640
 it is necessary but good 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 that if it's done better 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.850
 better always remains more presentable 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.790
 for our own use for our 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.520
 digital girls worth is not necessary to what 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.859
 best 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.310
 that are so perfect but if we are going to 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.729
 sell age 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.810
 we better do it well if people do not 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.810
 understand nothing 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.890
 and this I do for entertainment 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.979
 you always know nothing 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.920
 I try to do it well also 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.490
 for me about I do not like that people 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.870
 sees it 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.830
 they like that they crave 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.830
 and do not ask me 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.790
 finished the opening 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.310
 we give you entrance to make a knot for 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.110
 make sure that in that sense 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.929
 but he loves you my sister takes her 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.780
 like 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.190
 short through the mouth 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.190
 we already have it but once 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.350
 and it's there do not worry because then 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 it does not go away so that's why there's no problem 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 any 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.790
 we take in half to be able to be but to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.180
 eye as you know which is half 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.220
 ahead is like that and now we go back to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.890
 catch the thread I like to make the knots 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.440
 lost 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.319
 exactly where is half 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.209
 we take here 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.280
 and now we are doing it more at random 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.280
 you know it does not have to be perfect anymore 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.340
 they are all bigger 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.210
 because this is to be able to be 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.180
 at 23 because this is for 06 look 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.180
 look at you 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.710
 see how it shrinks we have the bow 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.230
 made with the tip and is here 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.230
 and now let's try on the fold 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.120
 has been done 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.360
 pass the needle through it though it would be 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.910
 the most out 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.770
 We passed the needle survey because it is more 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
 cloth 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.700
 and now we give it a few laps not 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.580
 long nor very strong to be able to be 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.500
 worth and behind 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.450
 such ensuring deaths the often 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.320
 always ensure that there is 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.320
 we will escape 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.490
 We cut the bow we have left 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.090
 look 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.090
 now we take 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.040
 and we put some silicone 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.600
 hot back where we made the knot 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.600
 a little platoon 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.989
 and we hit the bulb the color that 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.989
 you like more I preferred 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.639
 on-line 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.840
 but good and only much of each one 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.840
 let's have a little dry 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.350
 this we go until we have made a 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.450
 centimeter wide the strip 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.770
 and now it is so that we do not see the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.810
 thread or the rubber and from behind we take a 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.160
 little silicone to remove the needle 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.160
 let's take 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.930
 We put some silicone in here 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.360
 in the center 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.100
 and we hit the digital 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.969
 we push 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:15.449
 this fabric especially 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:18.619
 they are passed but it does not happen that this is not a 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.619
 impediment to follow 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.209
 we choose once we have it 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:29.209
 created from behind 

00:05:30.049 --> 00:05:34.039
 we turn it around 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.500
 hit back but has no 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.270
 super coquette 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.230
 I had also noticed 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.230
 or who commit 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.949
 and we put some silicone 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.200
 and a little 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.700
 already stick 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160
 and 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.440
 we would make the hair of the mules 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.089
 remove the silicone remains that 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.449
 may be left because the crimes remain 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.449
 bad 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.470
 and the tie 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.470
 make 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.409
 look this is a little bit more 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:34.169
 cortito to the best 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.169
 truth I already have the others these 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:45.650
 the three that I said it was going to be 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.650
 I have made another of another kind 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:52.949
 it's the same but I've caught tape fails 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:57.400
 picked up this is a little smaller 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:59.900
 has a little less amount 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.659
 I've picked 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.659
 or 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:04.659
 forgive me 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.880
 as one 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.659
 in the dawn of work 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.110
 15 centimeters 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.420
 about 15 centimeters by four of action 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.490
 if it's a breeze a little smaller 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.129
 You can make them a little smaller and 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.469
 always be flirtatious too and nothing 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:33.409
 I have changed I have caught tape fails 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:35.360
 white with the piquillo in pink I have it 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.899
 another color because it seems that everything 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.899
 goes pink 

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:43.229
 and 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.640
 but I also have the navy blue with 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:52.010
 the appetite in white I have left very 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.380
 little red I have it in red but not 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:58.750
 I can teach it because I put it 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.490
 therefore here we have the game of 

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:04.430
 I hope you liked it and I hope 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.290
 your answers and look unintentionally 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.510
 I think they have come out more coquettish than 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:11.590
 none 

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.090
 you already think 

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.060
 Thank you very much for your time 

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.350
 dedicated and nothing and you will tell me that another 

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.350
 a greeting has come out
