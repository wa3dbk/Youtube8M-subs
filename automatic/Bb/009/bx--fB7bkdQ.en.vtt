of pizzas chopped up I think it would be
quite<00:03:48.490> hot<00:03:52.260> quite<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> few<00:03:53.500> seeds<00:03:53.740> in<00:03:53.980> there

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050

then<00:03:59.050> yeah<00:03:59.170> heat<00:03:59.380> wise<00:03:59.590> it's<00:03:59.890> not<00:04:00.100> actually

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
then yeah heat wise it's not actually

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.540 
then yeah heat wise it's not actually
it's<00:04:01.900> kind<00:04:02.170> of<00:04:02.260> bypass<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.890> throat<00:04:03.160> but<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.400> can

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
it's kind of bypass the throat but I can

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.760 
it's kind of bypass the throat but I can
already<00:04:03.850> feel<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.240> kind<00:04:04.810> of<00:04:04.960> working<00:04:05.500> its<00:04:05.650> way

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770
