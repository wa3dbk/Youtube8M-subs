00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.419
 every recipe is low red pizza 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.600
 carbonara in my own way 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.810
 ok then carbonara so you'll find out 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.730
 precisely they are doing the procedure 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.280
 meanwhile we read the ingredients thanks 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:29.950
 to our graphic 100 g of flour 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:34.239
 petra 1 45 g of water a g of yeast 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:39.579
 then packed for the dough a kilo of 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 petra flour 3 600 g of water 23 grams 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.800
 of salt 25 grams of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 50 g of wheat germ in bric flakes 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 25 and 5 grams of compressed yeast 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.180
 also for the filling for precisely the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.980
 carbonara in the manner of renato bosco 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.719
 we have 60 g of peeled tomatoes 80 g of 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.670
 mozzarella 40 g of bacon an egg 10 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:16.720
 grams of Monte Veronese del Pepenero 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.850
 flour, yeast and water then 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.920
 let's start mixing our ingredients 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.540
 this type of dough I make goes 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.280
 positioned there for 18 hours 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.350
 so why is it a little more than yes 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.200
 can absolutely devote to 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.210
 to the mixture with exact pre-dam mixture 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.470
 as you can see it must be left enough 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.030
 raw already done already done we already 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.510
 we just have to mix the three 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.369
 ingredients together really 18 hours 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.000
 we get this we say this pre 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.500
 dough we start our dough 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.470
 we take our flour the water and the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.470
 beer the flour I also include the chariot 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 not all the water but I keep a part of it 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 we add a little to our dough 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.890
 let's start working 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.740
 I also add my yeast now and 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.160
 I oil ok if you want to prepare in the meantime 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.470
 mozzarella cut tomato 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.580
 so we organize the recipe well 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 a little oil salt then put some 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.970
 buzz the basil very good and now with 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.850
 the hands I work for precisely the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.070
 peeled tomato I have to destroy the 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 let's not do it with the blender 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.120
 because they are the seeds they could give a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.120
 exact exact bitter taste 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.520
 check my dough I see that it is 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.960
 well formed and can start 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.960
 add the oil 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.640
 meanwhile, to make a man, you said it 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:12.260
 I beat the cheese with a little salt 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.280
 Exact work is free of cheese 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.280
 this at home on the Veronese mountain 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.900
 you are very good has always lived 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.590
 very well if you don't need them anymore 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:34.420
 may also no longer serve us look at that 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.750
 show that it is beautiful formulated i 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.750
 minor 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.300
 while you let the dough rest 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.230
 because the dough must rest in the center 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.180
 of the twenty minutes 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.620
 meanwhile the government is mixing 10 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.350
 millions will seem to be those who prepare to 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.510
 projects so I should in theory 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.960
 throw it again and I'll leave you there too 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.970
 left-handed at this point I prepare mine 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.990
 balls here we are 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.180
 a nice cut of net that I prepare 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.710
 250- gram bowls 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.740
 I take my ball and I go to roll 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.290
 and then I close it by pinching from below and 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.910
 this is my ball ok i'd put 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.070
 my balls rise and leave them 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.660
 avoid these balls at a 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.600
 room temperature around 24 24 degrees 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.820
 for 46 hours after 42 hours 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.830
 and here they are our balls here 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.610
 now logically we have to stretch but 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.900
 we see that hands at 45 degrees and start 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.270
 work it so that your ball turns 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.670
 in a little girl and crush the ball 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.760
 always leaves trying to create the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:57.010
 cornice bra mission ok but take 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:59.080
 the dough is pulled and tadpole pulls eg 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.700
 when you see yourself, your mother will be coordinated 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.290
 his turns if I have to do it absolutely 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.290
 watched I take some flour away 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.480
 and put it on the card for shopping born 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.460
 because it is kneaded because gluten 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.139
 however it was well formed at the beginning and 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.460
 He has retained the air inside and 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.630
 it becomes a fantastic thing 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.870
 I take the tomato and put it on top 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.870
 my pizza 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.160
 I'm going into cooking 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.710
 after those six seven minutes 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.540
 here we are with our pizza I 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:42.400
 I prepared 23 basil leaves also 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:44.830
 23 our mozzarella we put the 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.590
 the bacon point bacon we have before 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.360
 made to fry to lose some 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.350
 of fat arrived right now 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.350
 let's also add our man 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.800
 let's put our mountain in Verona 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:02.350
 another scratch and then we put 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.430
 all the pancetta, the mozzarella, the egg 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.919
 the cheese the tomato previously 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.660
 two leaflets of color basil a 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.340
 bit of color and logically it would go 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.770
 baked for 2 3 minutes and for 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.600
 melt the mozzarella and ingredients 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.600
 monte veronese and the pizza is ready
