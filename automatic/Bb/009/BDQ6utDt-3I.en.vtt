00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 welcome this channel about him body and your 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.670
 coach Denis Galadze 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.400
 today I will show you a workout for 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.570
 losing weight under workout I lost weight 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.269
 lost my clients lose weight and you 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.920
 Let's start today I will point out a circular training 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.140
 This training is suitable for girls. 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.900
 so for boys people any 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.969
 age all exercises are performed friend 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.190
 for a friend without rest so as not to delay 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.410
 video I did not show the warm-up is not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.270
 forget that you need to warm up 5-10 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.210
 minutes not any of the basket and simulators and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 first exercise bench press 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.820
 perform 15-20 reps without haste 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 to inhale lower the bar to exhale 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.379
 starting position for girls can 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.930
 this exercise seems too heavy 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.930
 so the girl can take bodibar 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.330
 next exercise squats 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.670
 again for girls it may seem 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.190
 this exercise is too heavy therefore a 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.250
 I also recommend taking either a bodibar or 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.710
 squat without weight such weight is selected 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.960
 every exercise that you could do 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.780
 20 times closely follow the technique 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.370
 do not straighten your legs until the end 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.170
 slightly bent at the knee 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.260
 to prevent blockage of the joint 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 not to load once more in the knees 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.860
 it should not be too easy for me 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.380
 to be very hard because such 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.630
 3-4 laps you have to do 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.320
 and the next pull-up exercise 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.000
 mane to the throne if you can pull up 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.970
 yourself something 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.880
 try doing it 20 times if not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.300
 you can then pull up or have a grave 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.040
 throne 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.070
 if your gym hasnt 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.270
 gravitron cars can be pulled 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 the bar was pressed with feet to the floor 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.700
 goal program to work out only 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.220
 large muscle groups 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.080
 the more muscles and the more he doesn't 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.850
 spends energy during class so 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.890
 small muscle groups I do not see the point 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.000
 insert into this program and the following 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.140
 exercise again on the pectoral muscle 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.140
 push barbell 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.580
 on the inhale we fall down on the exhale in the original 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.580
 position 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.870
 and the very same rod and squeeze yourself 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.540
 the next exercise is squatting in gaping 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:56.140
 feet shoulder width on inhale 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 crouching on the exhale starting position 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.250
 note that the legs are not completely 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.370
 straighten and 0 to leave the knees 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.680
 bent more detailed technique all 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.040
 exercises until I show in 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.580
 other videos here are just the very basis 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.069
 programs 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.560
 but in circles you can rest from 3 to 5 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.630
 minutes to start you can rest for five 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.000
 minutes and after a while as already 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.430
 get used to the program more or less 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 remove rest up to 3 minutes the following 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.069
 exercise we perform on the back 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.800
 frontal thrust 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.170
 wring out tight belly up to exhale 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.480
 pull on the breath in the original 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.130
 position try every repetition 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.380
 maximally reduce the shoulder blades 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.870
 to use more back muscles a 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.239
 not arm muscles because back muscles 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.360
 more than arm muscles and spends more 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.360
 energy 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.069
 the next arm reduction exercise 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.629
 simulator again on large groups 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.049
 the muscles 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:02.189
 Belly muscles to breathe in the exhaust 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.189
 exhale to the starting position 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.120
 the back is maximally pressed to the shoulder blade 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.120
 tear off 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.989
 perform 15 20 repetitions as in all 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:25.930
 other exercises and then go right away 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:31.190
 but at the same bin in the leg press Smith Machine 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.800
 legs shoulder-width to inhale lower to 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.280
 angle of 90 degrees at the knee joint 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.130
 exhale starting position 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.270
 Knees, as always, do not block 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.509
 leave a little bent at the end 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.509
 movements 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.129
 and again we go make the back vertical 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:01.439
 pinch pinch with tight belly on 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.590
 exhale pull the chin to inhale when 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:07.280
 we try our best 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.280
 bring down the shoulder blades 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.960
 further we will do all the same little hands 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:30.879
 exercise you can choose any 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.449
 for biceps can be both dumbbells and 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.999
 rods 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.300
 I chose to blocking it for me more 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:41.639
 conveniently made biceps 15 20 reps 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.639
 if you have to do triceps 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.770
 on the exhale bend your hands to inhale 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.770
 initial position 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.800
 cook with a dumbbell to start right away 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.620
 do shoulder to exhale raise the dumbbells 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.510
 on the board the starting position 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.350
 dumbbells don't think too high 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.150
 think to the parallel with the floor and 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.220
 little do press on hi can 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.690
 choose also any exercise not 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.889
 surely the exercise that I 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:25.070
 showing after training you have to do 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.940
