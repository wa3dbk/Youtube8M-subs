00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
boil up to boiling and then we'll be on

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.860 
boil up to boiling and then we'll be on
to<00:01:24.680> step<00:01:24.890> three<00:01:27.160> also<00:01:28.160> place<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.790> lid<00:01:29.150> on<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.360> so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
to step three also place a lid on it so

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.420

put<00:01:32.870> it<00:01:32.960> nice<00:01:33.110> lid<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:33.800> heats<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.190> up<00:01:34.280> a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
put it nice lid on it so heats it up a

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.620 
put it nice lid on it so heats it up a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.510 

just<00:01:48.020> turn<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.500> down<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.040> it<00:01:49.100> gives<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.400> nice

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
just turn it down so it gives a nice

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.880 
just turn it down so it gives a nice
little<00:01:49.580> simmer<00:01:50.120> just<00:01:50.810> kind<00:01:51.050> of<00:01:51.110> like<00:01:51.260> that<00:01:51.440> and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
little simmer just kind of like that and
