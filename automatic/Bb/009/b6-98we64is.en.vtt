00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
this process generally takes 25 maybe 30

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.200 
this process generally takes 25 maybe 30
seconds<00:02:14.440> when<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.560> done<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:17.030> green

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
seconds when it's done the green

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.060 

now<00:03:37.930> that<00:03:38.080> we<00:03:38.170> have<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.440> green<00:03:38.620> indicator

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
now that we have the green indicator

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.520

this<00:04:10.630> tripod<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.920> unit<00:04:12.160> will<00:04:12.220> be<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.580> fine

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
this tripod the unit will be just fine

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.090 
this tripod the unit will be just fine
if<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.840> shake<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.200> unit<00:04:14.500> or<00:04:14.680> moved<00:04:14.890> on<00:04:15.010> the

tripod it will sense that movement and
it<00:04:17.739> will<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:18.040> level<00:04:18.220> itself<00:04:18.609> from<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.359> point

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
it will be level itself from that point

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.780 
it will be level itself from that point
