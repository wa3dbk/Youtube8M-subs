00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.260
 I would like to talk about setting of the lighting in the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.640
 It's a real 3d space 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.850
 To put multiple signatures 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:19.890
 Though there are many cases that make the production better than that 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:22.890
 This time it is the convenience of the explanation I think that I would like to explain using only one light 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 First of all, it is the one put by default 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:36.110
 This camera is an object that proves that this weather child is in the object 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.110
 It is here you are, but the kind of proof is placed is that health matter at fault and grinded 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:45.160
 Once you choose here in the state in which you select this object illumination 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:51.670
 Kind of proof is point point light source then mountain sunlight 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.329
 Can choose some kind lighting of the Fu say 3 lamp area lamb to the spot 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.390
 I will 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.730
 First of all, if you try to render from a point light source normally 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 And if you that are out now rendered at that point light source 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:11.050
 Because it is a point light source, it is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance if that distance approaches naturally 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.420
 This means that the closer you get closer, the brighter the subject will be. 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.920
 Of course that it moves away to in 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.370
 It becomes darker 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.640
 In eh against it 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:28.010
 3 Solar If you choose solar light 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:34.490
 In this case, of course , the irradiation from which of the two children is irradiated 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:39.360
 As it comes to be able to choose direction, it coats in the state seen from the front of the steel tapping blade in the state seen from above 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.950
 Now press that r to adjust the angle r to adjust the angle 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.050
 Toward the irradiation direction such Fu from Which is sunlight it is and I'll decide to which way 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.090
 The 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.060
 I can confirm that there is radiation , so let's try rendering with sunlight with this 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.409
 is not it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 I understand that it will be 8 if you look at it like this 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:05.950
 I'm making a wall, but I'm putting it here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:12.080
 For some reason in it has come out even the shadow of the wall is this originally seen such competed 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 The near future infinite from the parallel light rays Why far this is to say that natural is it the sun light of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.250
 The brightness of the subject does not change even if it comes close to or away from it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.500
 Ne 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:30.250
 Even if it is brought to the inside of that wall, it is premised that light actually comes from the other side of the wall 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:37.300
 The shadow of this wall will come out here 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:39.800
 When dealing with sunlight, if there is a wall or ceiling, naturally the ceiling of the ceiling or wall will also be in the room 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.720
 It will be said that you get stuck 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.910
 This is of course the case 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.220
 Band lighting and global as sunlight entering from where it is vacant 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.970
 Give to know the illumination 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 It is unnecessary 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.730
 Hey it 's another spotlight at the next spotlight but the spotlight is 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.159
 It looks like this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.159
 The setting item will come here later 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.510
 Here 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.620
 Spot size Shape size or blend and so on 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.980
 And Gu' the size is available in the distance and the car distance Toka Poi color to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 It will be like this if you do 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.069
 It 's like this when the distance is reduced and the range of illumination range that the spotlight hits 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.850
 Is it 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.940
 I have to adjust it here 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.010
 There is a size and how many times the angle is applied 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.880
 Then there is also the distance here, so this also affects 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.350
 It is useless and just do not hit actually eh this properly 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.770
 In this case, it will be a form that the light does not reach to the back of this wall for a moment 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.610
 Properly the distance 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:57.590
 I will raise it and bring it to the extent that light strikes 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.450
 And if you render with this, it looks like this is because the way above is a bit overshadowed 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.480
 One more time 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.280
 From the child is it then the front in a state viewed from above at it again against this with the light-chan 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.390
 Hmm 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:16.060
 Contains hit in the state as seen from above has hit even in a state as seen from the front 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.220
 To render guidance and is a form of this kind of Fu in the spotlight 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.360
 Then to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.410
 hemi plateau It Is the I mean this hemi Tsu lamp that uniformly light Atarii 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.590
 Because it is Masu 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.110
 In the case of the hemi lamp, that shadow can not be done 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.740
 That 's right it's the way it is 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.990
 Generally used as that auxiliary light 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.650
 What's the darkest place in the shadows using the main light buying type ? 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.720
 In 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.750
 A as an auxiliary light using the hemi lamp 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.530
 There is also a wind-like usage to give Japan light in the part of the shadow 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.880
 Then it is a guy called last area lamp, but this 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.060
 Do you understand here ? 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:59.430
 It's a bit hard to see. 8 In the case of the area lamp, it becomes the area plateau. 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.610
 But the size of the surface is 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.840
 here 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.629
 And say the shape of the area I have a say I this size, but increase this size 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.260
 You can see here by doing it 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:19.320
 Small is now to be a large surface that in this area lamp 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:22.590
 When that shadow comes out soft and to shed light the I's are the benefits surface greatly from the large surface 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.990
 Because there is a feature to say that here 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.800
 Well that size in the studio make you soft and raised by increasing the size of a certain degree surface 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.100
 Is it 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.249
 Use the umbrella will be the same kind of shape as say the light 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.179
 Let's try it for a moment 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:42.740
 But it is just as it is not at all hard shadow in just now 

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:43.960
 In fact, it should be soft in the face plateau large lizard, but it is here 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.370
 By 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.720
 Sample Kedomo it has become I mean this sample Zu' However in 1 raise this number 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:55.630
 We are doing it 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:59.009
 In fact, if you take many sample points and recalculate that shadow, it will be soft. 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.009
 It does not correspond to the shadow Yes 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.720
 To 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.710
 It's a little rough, but it's that soft shadow 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.860
 Part of the dark main office to used books and 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.880
 Part of the prosperity that is hitting the partial light only a little 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:19.630
 Well the main office reflection comes out in the screen right away 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.129
 In general , the energy of the plateau tends to increase 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:27.050
 In this case, 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:31.940
 Here's the setting of energy and the number of numbers 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.370
 The balance may be better Well here is that kind of trial and error many times 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.520
 What 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:41.470
 You will need to do something like adjust with Athena 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:49.860
 More than first point light source then sunlight to about that certification 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:49.860
 We introduced the spotlight Emi Kogen area what these five types
