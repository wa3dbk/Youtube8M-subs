a belt sander that was just basically
not<00:00:48.359> needed<00:00:48.749> anymore<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> belt<00:00:49.440> sander<00:00:49.649> so

to<00:00:54.780> fine<00:00:55.050> tune<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.589> joint<00:00:56.039> let's<00:00:56.819> go<00:00:56.940> ahead

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
to fine tune that joint let's go ahead

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.579 
to fine tune that joint let's go ahead
and<00:00:57.179> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> look<00:00:57.569> a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.839> bit<00:00:58.109> closer<00:00:58.319> I'll

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
and take a look a little bit closer I'll

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.889 
and take a look a little bit closer I'll
show<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> exactly<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.339> mean<00:00:59.659> okay<00:01:00.659> as<00:01:00.749> you

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
can see I have my leg right here and I

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.020 
can see I have my leg right here and I
have<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.080> rocker<00:01:04.339> now<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.520> is<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> gap

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
have the rocker now there is a gap

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030 
have the rocker now there is a gap
between<00:01:06.240> these<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:06.870> they<00:01:07.020> haven't<00:01:07.350> been<00:01:07.440> fit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
between these two they haven't been fit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.240 
between these two they haven't been fit
perfectly<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.390> yet<00:01:09.660> now<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.560> simply<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
perfectly just yet now very simply I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
perfectly just yet now very simply I
take<00:01:11.730> my<00:01:11.850> piece<00:01:11.910> of<00:01:12.210> sandpaper<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> grit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
take my piece of sandpaper with the grit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.520 
take my piece of sandpaper with the grit
side<00:01:13.800> facing<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.520> place<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.600> between<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.110> leg

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
side facing up place it between the leg

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
side facing up place it between the leg
and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.850> rocker<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.510> then<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.200> draw<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:21.630> same

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and the rocker and then I draw the same

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
and the rocker and then I draw the same
paper<00:01:22.080> through<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> joint<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
paper through the joint now you have to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
paper through the joint now you have to
be<00:01:23.880> careful<00:01:24.330> when<00:01:24.450> you're<00:01:24.570> drawing<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.080> don't

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
be careful when you're drawing it don't

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.470 
be careful when you're drawing it don't
pull<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.160> sandpaper<00:01:26.550> numbers<00:01:27.270> don't

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
pull up on the sandpaper numbers don't

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.690 
pull up on the sandpaper numbers don't
pull<00:01:27.660> this<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.500> you'll<00:01:28.830> round<00:01:29.160> over

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pull this way because you'll round over

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
pull this way because you'll round over
that<00:01:30.060> leg<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.080> either

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that leg what you want to do is either

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.230 
that leg what you want to do is either
pull<00:01:31.590> straight<00:01:31.980> out<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.250> possibly<00:01:32.850> even<00:01:32.940> on<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
pull straight out or possibly even on a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.040 
pull straight out or possibly even on a
downward<00:01:34.220> stroke<00:01:35.220> such<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> now

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
downward stroke such as this now

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.660 
downward stroke such as this now
just<00:01:37.350> drawing<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.890> through<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> two<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> not

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
just drawing it through the two is not

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.430 
just drawing it through the two is not
really<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.180> provide<00:01:39.420> enough<00:01:39.690> friction

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
really going to provide enough friction

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to actually do any good so I provide I

to actually do any good so I provide I
push<00:01:44.160> down<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> leg<00:01:45.660> as<00:01:45.960> I'm

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
push down a little bit on the leg as I'm

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
push down a little bit on the leg as I'm
drawing<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> through<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.090> might<00:01:48.330> find

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
drawing it through now you might find

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.120 
drawing it through now you might find
it's<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.870> little<00:01:48.990> clumsy<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> leg

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's a little clumsy because the leg

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
it's a little clumsy because the leg
wants<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.460> move<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.110> used

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
wants to move but you kind of get used

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
wants to move but you kind of get used
to<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.620> you<00:01:53.280> may<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.700> also<00:01:53.940> clamp<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to that you may have to also clamp this

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390 
to that you may have to also clamp this
to<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.140> work<00:01:55.320> clamp<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> rockers<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.280> your

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
to your work clamp the rockers to your

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.210 
to your work clamp the rockers to your
work<00:01:56.550> surface<00:01:56.790> as<00:01:57.210> I've<00:01:57.780> done<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.650> may

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
work surface as I've done back here may

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.590 
work surface as I've done back here may
want<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> put<00:01:59.640> another<00:01:59.790> clamp<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.270> prevent<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
want to put another clamp to prevent it

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
want to put another clamp to prevent it
from<00:02:00.659> moving<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.800> basically<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.370> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
from moving but basically that's the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.220 
from moving but basically that's the
whole<00:02:02.790> procedure<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.450> want<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.690> draw<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
whole procedure you want to draw this

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.890 
whole procedure you want to draw this
through<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.040> close<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:06.030> gap<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.510> now<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.750> may

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
through and close that gap up now it may

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.199 
through and close that gap up now it may
take<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.009> several<00:02:08.369> dozen<00:02:08.729> strokes<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
take you know several dozen strokes to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.300 
take you know several dozen strokes to
get<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> done<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.470> eventually<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.039> gap

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
get that done but eventually that gap

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.920 
get that done but eventually that gap
does

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
does

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.050 
does
is<00:02:12.049> enough<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.920> where<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.310> remove<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.819> you'll

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
is enough to where you remove it you'll

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.490 
is enough to where you remove it you'll
see<00:02:14.269> there<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.510> absolutely<00:02:15.019> no<00:02:15.230> gap

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
see there is absolutely no gap

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.589 
see there is absolutely no gap
whatsoever<00:02:16.129> between<00:02:16.340> those<00:02:16.700> two<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.180> that's

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
whatsoever between those two and that's

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.300 
whatsoever between those two and that's
ideally<00:02:18.379> what<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.650> want<00:02:18.859> then<00:02:19.129> you'll<00:02:19.250> be

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
ideally what you want then you'll be

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.890 
ideally what you want then you'll be
able<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.549> collect<00:02:19.790> clamp<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.450> glue<00:02:20.629> the<00:02:20.750> two

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
able to collect clamp and glue the two

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.289 
able to collect clamp and glue the two
together<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.920> rocker<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.609> not<00:02:22.819> creak

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
together and the rocker will not creak

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.200 
together and the rocker will not creak
from<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.659> point<00:02:23.870> forward
