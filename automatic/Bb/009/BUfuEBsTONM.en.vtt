00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
the materials we did a lot of testing we

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.980 
the materials we did a lot of testing we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
blockers and catchers I mean that's

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.980 
blockers and catchers I mean that's
definitely<00:02:58.709> going<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.980> nice<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.990> so
