00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all guys and the minutes in one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.560
 new minecraft guide today i want you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.530
 show how to build a farm of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.830
 Cactus simple and fast that not 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.960
 requires a large quantity of 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 materials that is functional and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.600
 100 percent working but 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.850
 especially the automatic one 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.769
 need are simple blocks from 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.550
 buildings 16 blocks of sada and cactus 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:37.680
 4 buckets of water a hopper or even 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 called or for itself a trunk or chest for 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.920
 first we have to create a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.880
 square of 11 x xi where it will be contained 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.910
 our water 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:56.540
 let's create it 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 and 11 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.540
 also horizontally 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.059
 and we close it 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.930
 at this point we have to place the water 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.930
 at the four corners to make it so 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.950
 that this space remains in the center 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 empty here we dig of one and position 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.119
 lauper 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.090
 at this point we can dig here 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.780
 below to go and position ours 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:42.550
 choice where the cacti will be contained 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:45.399
 precisely we place it here now 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.750
 we must neither place all the blocks 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:52.450
 in checkerboard is furthest in a mo 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.979
 from the bordeaux and place the first one here 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.740
 sand block 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.729
 we skip the block that one space 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.369
 place the second one until the end 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:09.880
 we continue along the whole circumference 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:11.560
 of the square we also like blocks 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.780
 inside for efficiency 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 one hundred percent and we can already start 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.010
 to place cactus 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.070
 now we position in blocks for 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 make it easier to create everything 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.730
 a sort of roof all along the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.730
 perimeter of the cacti 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:53.510
 we also fill the inside look without 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.110
 mistake the position of the blocks e 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:02.450
 of course and now as before we go to 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.790
 always remove the blocks using 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.320
 the checkerboard method 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.980
 let's start these we do the first 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.980
 diagonal made here 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.730
 and finally here 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.209
 this type of roof causes the cacti 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.430
 once we have grown by two, we are there 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.099
 we plant automatically when when 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.019
 they will grow as they have a 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.810
 close block won't make it 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.750
 block will be dropped in this 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.390
 puddle of water can also happen that the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.379
 block also end up in one of the cacti and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.440
 so let's not drop it we can 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.560
 also adjust the height of the roof e 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.959
 lower it by one or raise it by one 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.420
 because cactus should grow too 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:08.950
 up to four blocks and what to say 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.870
 here the medicine is almost complete 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:20.090
 we just have to wait for them to grow up 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:22.940
 cactus and as you see they will go once 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.919
 adro patios now but they will go to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:31.310
 end up in this water course e 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.919
 will end up in the work well I remind you that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.260
 if the video you liked to leave a 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.250
 I like it's a comment and we'll see each other 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.250
 the next hello
