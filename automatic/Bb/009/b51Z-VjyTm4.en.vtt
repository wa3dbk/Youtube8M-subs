00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
believe it is pronounced like it's

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.470

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.870 
supposed to be like just yeah but it's
like<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.410> way<00:04:57.590> how<00:04:57.800> they<00:04:57.950> say<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.580> actual

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
honestly there's something in the first

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.340 
honestly there's something in the first
few<00:06:22.880> chapters<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.450> I<00:06:23.480> really<00:06:23.990> shouldn't<00:06:24.020> be

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
few chapters so I really shouldn't be

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.440 
few chapters so I really shouldn't be
going<00:06:24.500> too<00:06:24.710> much<00:06:24.890> into<00:06:24.950> it<00:06:25.340> but<00:06:25.490> yeah<00:06:26.090> this

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
going too much into it but yeah this

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.420 
going too much into it but yeah this
could<00:06:26.690> have<00:06:26.840> like<00:06:27.380> you<00:06:27.620> know<00:06:27.650> potential<00:06:28.280> in

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
could have like you know potential in

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.620 
could have like you know potential in
the<00:06:28.550> future<00:06:28.580> and<00:06:29.120> I'm<00:06:29.240> really<00:06:29.450> looking

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
the future and I'm really looking

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.480 
the future and I'm really looking
forward<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.110> it<00:06:30.260> but<00:06:30.440> I<00:06:30.650> sort<00:06:31.010> of<00:06:31.070> miss<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.400> think

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
forward to it but I sort of miss I think

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.010 
forward to it but I sort of miss I think
that<00:06:31.700> much<00:06:31.790> watching<00:06:32.060> as<00:06:32.180> always<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:32.720> I<00:06:32.900> will

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020
