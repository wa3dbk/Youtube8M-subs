00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.450 
hopefully will be able to actually get
those<00:01:52.499> before<00:01:53.499> that<00:01:53.649> though<00:01:53.829> I<00:01:53.859> need<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.280> check

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
those before that though I need to check

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.429 
those before that though I need to check
on<00:01:54.639> my<00:01:54.729> auctions<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.509> make<00:01:55.689> sure<00:01:55.719> that<00:01:56.109> you

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
on my auctions and make sure that you

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.469 
on my auctions and make sure that you
know<00:01:56.530> everything<00:01:56.829> is<00:01:57.039> up<00:01:57.219> pretty<00:01:57.609> well<00:01:57.999> and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
know everything is up pretty well and

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.349 
know everything is up pretty well and
one<00:01:59.079> thing<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.289> also<00:01:59.679> notice<00:02:00.219> is<00:02:00.429> like<00:02:00.700> my

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
one thing I also notice is like my

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.199 
one thing I also notice is like my
infinite<00:02:02.020> dust<00:02:02.259> is<00:02:02.710> now<00:02:03.249> down<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.700> three<00:02:03.729> gold

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
infinite dust is now down to three gold

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.789 
infinite dust is now down to three gold
apiece<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:04.749> it's<00:02:04.990> starting<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.469> get<00:02:05.560> in<00:02:05.709> the

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
apiece so it's starting to get in the

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.770 
apiece so it's starting to get in the
range<00:02:06.009> where<00:02:06.280> it's<00:02:06.490> not<00:02:06.819> really<00:02:07.179> worth<00:02:07.329> it<00:02:07.539> for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
range where it's not really worth it for

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.630 
range where it's not really worth it for
me<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.929> be<00:02:08.229> buying<00:02:08.530> abyss<00:02:09.009> crystals<00:02:09.039> this

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.180 
me to be buying abyss crystals this
shatter<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.539> unless<00:02:11.290> they're<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.950> cheap

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
