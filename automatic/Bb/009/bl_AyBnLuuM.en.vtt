00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
bump which the bump is this part it's

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.319 
bump which the bump is this part it's
measured<00:02:20.810> from<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.379> end<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.859> platform

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
measured from the end of the platform

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.899 
measured from the end of the platform
down<00:02:23.329> here<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:23.989> middle<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:25.099> usually<00:02:25.730> go<00:02:25.879> for

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
down here in the middle I usually go for

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.899 
down here in the middle I usually go for
not<00:02:26.870> 0.5<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.769> half<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.159> centimeter<00:02:28.609> shorter

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
not 0.5 so half a centimeter shorter

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.880 
not 0.5 so half a centimeter shorter
bump<00:02:29.090> or<00:02:29.269> a<00:02:29.540> four<00:02:29.900> centimeter<00:02:30.230> shorter<00:02:30.769> this

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
bump or a four centimeter shorter this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.280 
bump or a four centimeter shorter this
time<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.159> went<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.819> hole<00:02:32.329> one<00:02:32.720> centimeter

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
time I went for a hole one centimeter

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.910 
time I went for a hole one centimeter
shorter<00:02:33.620> BAM<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:35.629> go<00:02:35.870> for<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.200> supersoft

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
shorter BAM and I go for a supersoft

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.119 
shorter BAM and I go for a supersoft
shank<00:02:37.400> or<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> soft<00:02:37.970> shank<00:02:38.470> weave<00:02:39.470> easy<00:02:39.799> roll

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
shank or a soft shank weave easy roll

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.039 
shank or a soft shank weave easy roll
through<00:02:40.459> which<00:02:40.849> means<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> deme<00:02:41.510> point<00:02:41.840> is

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
through which means the deme point is

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.160 
through which means the deme point is
easy<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.590> achieve<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.310> I'd<00:02:44.090> go<00:02:44.359> for<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> four

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
easy to achieve and I'd go for a four

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.069 
easy to achieve and I'd go for a four
and<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.409> half<00:02:46.569> X<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:48.230> X<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.189> the<00:02:49.340> width<00:02:49.689> now<00:02:50.689> I'm

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
and a half X and X is the width now I'm

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.020 
and a half X and X is the width now I'm
pretty<00:02:51.650> sure<00:02:51.889> they<00:02:52.040> do<00:02:52.099> narrow<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.730> necks

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
pretty sure they do narrow the necks

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.369 
pretty sure they do narrow the necks
actually<00:02:53.419> and<00:02:53.540> I<00:02:53.599> think<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.840> might<00:02:53.989> go<00:02:54.139> for<00:02:54.169> that

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
actually and I think I might go for that

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.190 
actually and I think I might go for that
next<00:02:54.560> time<00:02:54.769> because<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.549> wear<00:02:56.120> even<00:02:56.599> double<00:02:56.989> x

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
next time because I wear even double x

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.440 
next time because I wear even double x
or<00:02:57.500> an<00:02:57.709> X<00:02:57.859> now<00:02:58.250> my<00:02:58.459> last<00:02:58.639> hair<00:02:58.939> will<00:02:59.060> double<00:02:59.269> X

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
or an X now my last hair will double X

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.659 
or an X now my last hair will double X
and<00:02:59.750> they<00:02:59.840> got<00:03:00.019> far<00:03:00.290> too<00:03:00.470> wide<00:03:00.709> for<00:03:00.739> me<00:03:01.129> now

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
and they got far too wide for me now

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.059 
and they got far too wide for me now
this<00:03:01.879> X<00:03:02.120> seems<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.859> even<00:03:03.859> a<00:03:03.919> little

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
this X seems to be even a little

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.990 
this X seems to be even a little
slightly<00:03:04.639> wider<00:03:05.019> not<00:03:06.019> slightly<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.409> but<00:03:06.620> two

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
slightly wider not slightly one but two

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.089 
slightly wider not slightly one but two
again<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.239> bit<00:03:08.419> slightly<00:03:08.659> wide<00:03:08.959> for<00:03:09.200> me<00:03:09.409> so<00:03:10.069> I

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
again it's bit slightly wide for me so I

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.069 
again it's bit slightly wide for me so I
might<00:03:10.669> next<00:03:10.909> time<00:03:11.060> ask<00:03:11.209> them<00:03:11.450> if<00:03:11.569> they<00:03:11.689> can<00:03:11.900> do

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
might next time ask them if they can do

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.550 
might next time ask them if they can do
even<00:03:12.319> narrower<00:03:13.269> then<00:03:14.269> fits<00:03:14.959> fine<00:03:15.139> but<00:03:15.439> also

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
even narrower then fits fine but also

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.690 
even narrower then fits fine but also
you've<00:03:15.799> got<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:15.980> remember<00:03:16.129> your<00:03:16.370> feet<00:03:16.549> do

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
you've got to remember your feet do

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580 
you've got to remember your feet do
change<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.269> I<00:03:17.329> recommend<00:03:17.750> going<00:03:17.930> for<00:03:18.260> fittings

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
change so I recommend going for fittings

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.159 
change so I recommend going for fittings
often<00:03:19.159> now<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:19.879> can't<00:03:20.419> go<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:20.629> get<00:03:20.750> fitted<00:03:20.930> with

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
then what I do is I switch them over to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.230 
then what I do is I switch them over to
basically<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.190> put<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.490> right<00:04:28.639> shoe<00:04:28.909> on<00:04:29.150> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240

basically I put the right shoe on the
left<00:04:29.419> foot<00:04:29.719> and<00:04:29.960> left<00:04:30.320> shoe<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:31.039> the<00:04:31.669> right

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
don't come over left and right so

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.029 
don't come over left and right so
basically<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:35.960> put<00:04:36.139> them<00:04:36.289> on<00:04:36.409> first<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.979> all

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
basically I put them on first of all

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.219 
basically I put them on first of all

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
i've decided that i keep that in mind

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.140 
i've decided that i keep that in mind

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
left not that you need to write both in

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.029 
left not that you need to write both in
each<00:04:59.389> because<00:04:59.630> you're<00:04:59.779> Garber<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.320> know<00:05:00.440> if

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
each because you're Garber you know if

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.379 
each because you're Garber you know if
this<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.520> right<00:05:01.700> shoe<00:05:01.940> than<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> other<00:05:02.300> is

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
this is the right shoe than the other is

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.899 
this is the right shoe than the other is
going<00:05:02.510> to<00:05:02.599> be<00:05:02.659> left<00:05:02.870> clearly<00:05:03.560> but<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.700> is

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
going to be left clearly but it is

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.050 
going to be left clearly but it is
important<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.419> wear<00:05:05.690> your<00:05:05.870> shoes<00:05:06.110> on<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:07.789> same

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
important to wear your shoes on the same

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.719 
important to wear your shoes on the same
for<00:05:08.419> each<00:05:08.630> time<00:05:08.990> because<00:05:09.289> each<00:05:09.830> foot<00:05:10.219> is<00:05:10.460> going

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
for each time because each foot is going

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.370 
for each time because each foot is going
to<00:05:10.789> be<00:05:10.909> different<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.450> they<00:05:11.990> will<00:05:12.169> mold

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
to be different and they will mold

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.709 
to be different and they will mold
differently<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.729> the<00:05:14.360> shoes<00:05:14.539> more

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
differently to the shoes more

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.659 
differently to the shoes more
differently<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.229> your<00:05:15.289> feet<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.219> basically

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
differently to your feet so basically

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.089 
differently to your feet so basically
ensure<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.779> you<00:05:18.260> are<00:05:18.409> wearing<00:05:18.620> your<00:05:18.830> shoes

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
ensure that you are wearing your shoes

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.000 
ensure that you are wearing your shoes
on<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.490> same<00:05:19.909> for<00:05:20.389> every<00:05:21.110> time<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.590> wear<00:05:21.800> them

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
on the same for every time you wear them

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.420 
on the same for every time you wear them
I<00:05:22.250> can't<00:05:22.789> stress<00:05:23.150> how<00:05:23.180> important<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:23.990> is

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
I can't stress how important that is

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.420 
I can't stress how important that is
once<00:05:25.430> I've<00:05:25.610> done<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:25.849> I<00:05:26.380> take<00:05:27.380> my<00:05:27.409> shoe<00:05:27.710> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
once I've done that I take my shoe and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.629 
once I've done that I take my shoe and
basically<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.960> step<00:05:29.960> on<00:05:30.199> box<00:05:30.860> very<00:05:31.279> lightly

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
basically I step on box very lightly

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.519 
basically I step on box very lightly
just<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:32.210> squash<00:05:32.510> it<00:05:32.539> a<00:05:32.750> bit<00:05:32.930> because<00:05:33.110> when

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:33.529 
just to squash it a bit because when

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.070 
just to squash it a bit because when
they<00:05:33.889> arrive<00:05:34.190> they're<00:05:34.460> quite<00:05:34.729> molded<00:05:35.690> up<00:05:35.900> if

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
they arrive they're quite molded up if

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.939 
they arrive they're quite molded up if
you<00:05:36.199> know<00:05:36.289> what<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.409> mean<00:05:36.590> so<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:36.770> like<00:05:36.919> to

don't<00:05:43.849> crush<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.270> too<00:05:44.570> much<00:05:44.779> because<00:05:44.960> you

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
don't crush it too much because you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.920 
don't crush it too much because you
don't<00:05:45.139> want<00:05:45.529> to<00:05:46.159> break<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.300> shoe<00:05:47.510> and<00:05:47.750> you

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
don't want to break the shoe and you

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.469 
don't want to break the shoe and you
don't<00:05:48.199> wish<00:05:48.650> goes<00:05:48.889> on<00:05:49.190> actually<00:05:49.610> made<00:05:49.820> to

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
don't wish goes on actually made to

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.510 
don't wish goes on actually made to
actually<00:05:50.930> conform<00:05:51.529> to<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:51.770> foot<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.099> they

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
actually conform to your foot so they

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.909 
actually conform to your foot so they
don't<00:05:52.699> really<00:05:52.849> need<00:05:53.089> much<00:05:53.330> breaking<00:05:53.839> in<00:05:53.990> apart

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
don't really need much breaking in apart

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.680 
don't really need much breaking in apart
from<00:05:54.949> the<00:05:55.130> shanks<00:05:55.460> if<00:05:55.639> you<00:05:55.760> get<00:05:55.909> like<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.210> medium

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
from the shanks if you get like a medium

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.320 
from the shanks if you get like a medium
showing<00:05:56.960> they<00:05:57.050> take<00:05:57.229> ages<00:05:57.589> anyway<00:05:58.430> so<00:05:59.000> because

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
showing they take ages anyway so because

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.700 
showing they take ages anyway so because
they're<00:05:59.449> super<00:05:59.599> soft<00:05:59.960> I<00:06:00.229> don't<00:06:00.409> need<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.589> do

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
they're super soft I don't need to do

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.379 
they're super soft I don't need to do
much<00:06:00.919> what<00:06:01.130> I<00:06:01.190> tend<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.430> do<00:06:01.610> find<00:06:02.089> where<00:06:02.270> my

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
much what I tend to do find where my

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.180 
much what I tend to do find where my
artistic<00:06:02.779> my<00:06:03.020> foot<00:06:03.169> in<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.349> shoe<00:06:03.529> wi-wo'

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
artistic my foot in the shoe wi-wo'

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.000 
artistic my foot in the shoe wi-wo'
arches<00:06:04.909> and<00:06:05.120> basically<00:06:05.960> I<00:06:06.080> just<00:06:06.560> bend<00:06:06.800> the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
arches and basically I just bend the

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.689 
arches and basically I just bend the
shank<00:06:07.330> this<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:09.949> get<00:06:10.130> a<00:06:10.159> nice<00:06:10.310> shape<00:06:10.520> like

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
shank this so I get a nice shape like

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.579 
shank this so I get a nice shape like
that<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.240> it<00:06:11.510> also<00:06:11.659> can<00:06:11.960> force<00:06:12.199> my<00:06:12.349> arch

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:12.589 
that and it also can force my arch

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.490 
that and it also can force my arch
better<00:06:13.029> now<00:06:14.029> weave<00:06:14.659> supersoft<00:06:14.839> shanks

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
better now weave supersoft shanks

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.550 
better now weave supersoft shanks
they're<00:06:15.680> very<00:06:15.830> easy<00:06:16.070> to<00:06:16.750> break<00:06:17.750> in<00:06:18.020> which<00:06:18.409> is

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
they're very easy to break in which is

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.890 
they're very easy to break in which is
why<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.740> like<00:06:18.889> them<00:06:19.099> and<00:06:19.279> also<00:06:19.479> for<00:06:20.479> my<00:06:20.599> foot

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
why I like them and also for my foot

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.010 
why I like them and also for my foot
supersoft<00:06:21.440> works<00:06:21.800> great<00:06:22.250> now<00:06:22.909> most<00:06:23.479> grish

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
supersoft works great now most grish

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.170 
supersoft works great now most grish
goes<00:06:24.260> off<00:06:24.589> the<00:06:24.740> rack<00:06:24.919> come<00:06:25.279> in<00:06:25.430> a<00:06:25.580> medium<00:06:25.880> shank

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
goes off the rack come in a medium shank

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.120 
goes off the rack come in a medium shank
which<00:06:26.779> is<00:06:26.930> great<00:06:27.139> because<00:06:27.320> they<00:06:27.589> last<00:06:27.800> long

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
which is great because they last long

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.730 
which is great because they last long
and<00:06:28.460> but<00:06:29.330> they<00:06:29.419> do<00:06:29.479> take<00:06:29.779> a<00:06:29.990> while<00:06:30.139> to<00:06:30.169> break<00:06:30.380> in

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
and but they do take a while to break in

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.500 
and but they do take a while to break in
but<00:06:30.919> then<00:06:31.099> it's<00:06:31.279> you<00:06:31.729> know<00:06:31.849> most<00:06:32.149> people<00:06:32.240> have

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
but then it's you know most people have

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.779 
but then it's you know most people have
