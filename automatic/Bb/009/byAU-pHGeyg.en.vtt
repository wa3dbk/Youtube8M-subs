00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
color I got is sand and I really was

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.919 
color I got is sand and I really was
looking<00:00:14.880> forward<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> getting<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.780> heard

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
looking forward to getting it on heard

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.529 
looking forward to getting it on heard
so<00:00:16.080> much<00:00:16.230> good<00:00:16.470> stuff<00:00:16.529> about<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:18.210> had

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
so much good stuff about it I just had

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.900 
so much good stuff about it I just had
to<00:00:18.660> try<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.340> discovered<00:00:20.609> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to try it and I just discovered that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.929 
to try it and I just discovered that
it's<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.240> not<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.600> me<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:22.250> think<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.760> main

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it's just not for me I think the main

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's just not for me I think the main
reason<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.230> don't<00:00:25.410> use<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
reason is because I don't use the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
reason is because I don't use the
moisturizer<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.369> don't<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> why<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> didn't

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
moisturizer I don't know why I didn't

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
moisturizer I don't know why I didn't
think<00:00:27.510> about<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.810> before<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.710> 18<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
think about that before I got 18 is

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.260 
think about that before I got 18 is
moisturizer<00:00:30.920> it's<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.160> purely<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.759> fault<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
moisturizer it's just purely my fault I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.370 
moisturizer it's just purely my fault I
feel<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.840> don't<00:00:34.020> feel<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.230> there's

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
feel like I don't feel like there's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
feel like I don't feel like there's
anything<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.860> wrong<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> product

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
anything really wrong with the product

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600 
anything really wrong with the product
but<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.530> something<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.309> can

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but it's just not something that I can

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.770 
but it's just not something that I can
use<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:39.149> feel<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.629> too<00:00:40.469> heavy<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.910> use

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780

for<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> whole<00:01:03.149> day<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.379> don't

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
for the whole day and I really don't

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.070 
for the whole day and I really don't
have<00:01:04.559> any<00:01:04.799> problems<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
have any problems I think that that

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.420 
have any problems I think that that
present<00:01:07.080> prime<00:01:07.290> was<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.590> sinking<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> really

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
present prime was that sinking it really

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.690 
present prime was that sinking it really
helps<00:01:08.760> control<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.450> oiliness<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:11.220> okay

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
helps control the oiliness and I'm okay

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
helps control the oiliness and I'm okay
I<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.689> why<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> ordered<00:01:13.860> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I don't really know why I ordered this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.109 
I don't really know why I ordered this
so<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.210> give<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> my<00:01:15.570> opinion

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
so just going to give you my opinion

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
so just going to give you my opinion
it's<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.360> too<00:01:18.659> heavy<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.049> me<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.560> feel<00:01:19.770> like

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it's just too heavy for me I feel like

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's just too heavy for me I feel like
it<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.939> almost<00:01:21.350> melts<00:01:22.350> off<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.830> face

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it really it almost melts off of my face

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
it really it almost melts off of my face
when<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.299> underneath<00:01:24.509> my<00:01:24.630> sunglasses

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
when I like underneath my sunglasses

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.060 
when I like underneath my sunglasses
it'll<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.250> real<00:01:26.430> melting<00:01:27.299> feeling<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
it'll get real melting feeling and just

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.219 
it'll get real melting feeling and just
isn't<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.189> me<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> color<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> good<00:01:31.200> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
isn't for me I think the color is good I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
isn't for me I think the color is good I
think<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> covers<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> season<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.970> wouldn't

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
think the covers in season I wouldn't

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.390 
think the covers in season I wouldn't
say<00:01:33.810> medium<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.500> say<00:01:34.770> more<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:34.979> light

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
say medium I would say more like light

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
say medium I would say more like light
to<00:01:35.610> medium<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> was<00:01:36.689> okay

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to medium so that was okay

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.210 
to medium so that was okay
I<00:01:37.290> could've<00:01:37.560> dealt<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I could've dealt with that for the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
I could've dealt with that for the
summer<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:40.020> I've<00:01:40.350> tried<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.770> play<00:01:40.950> about<00:01:41.070> four

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
summer but I've tried it play about four

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
summer but I've tried it play about four
times<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:41.970> can't<00:01:42.299> make<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> work<00:01:42.689> for

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
times and I just can't make it work for

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.889 
times and I just can't make it work for
me<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:45.090> using<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
me so that I think if you are using a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.560 
me so that I think if you are using a
moisturizer<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.729> maybe<00:01:47.880> dry<00:01:48.210> skin

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
moisturizer and you have maybe dry skin

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.600 
moisturizer and you have maybe dry skin
that<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.439> might<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.460> you're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that you might like it but if you're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.770 
that you might like it but if you're
like<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.799> oily<00:01:52.799> skin<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.790> I
