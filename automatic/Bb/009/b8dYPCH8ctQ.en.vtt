00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pretty cool looks similar to iron a

durable it is but that's what I've seen
it's<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.679> little<00:01:49.889> bit<00:01:49.979> strong<00:01:50.219> in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.429> iron<00:01:50.579> but

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
it's a little bit strong in the iron but

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's a little bit strong in the iron but
not<00:01:51.389> quite<00:01:51.599> as<00:01:51.659> strong<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.259> diamonds<00:01:53.099> go

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
not quite as strong as diamonds go

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.219 
not quite as strong as diamonds go
moving<00:01:53.489> on<00:01:53.639> now<00:01:53.819> to<00:01:53.849> the<00:01:54.149> next<00:01:54.659> part<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.079> right

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
moving on now to the next part all right

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
moving on now to the next part all right
now<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.709> next<00:01:55.829> problem<00:01:56.069> on<00:01:56.310> guys<00:01:56.489> we<00:01:56.819> have

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
now for next problem on guys we have

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.999 
now for next problem on guys we have
some<00:01:57.179> miscellaneous<00:01:57.569> items<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.499> couple<00:01:58.919> of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
some miscellaneous items in a couple of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.919 
some miscellaneous items in a couple of
blocks<00:01:59.279> let's<00:01:59.819> get<00:01:59.939> started<00:01:59.999> by<00:02:00.389> showing<00:02:00.749> you

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
blocks let's get started by showing you

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.260 
blocks let's get started by showing you
know<00:02:01.020> lightning<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.649> with<00:02:02.459> this<00:02:02.669> one<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:02.999> can

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
know lightning one with this one you can

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120 
know lightning one with this one you can
strike<00:02:03.630> down<00:02:03.840> lightning<00:02:04.169> wherever<00:02:04.739> you<00:02:04.799> wish

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
strike down lightning wherever you wish

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.580 
strike down lightning wherever you wish
so<00:02:05.969> go<00:02:06.090> ahead<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.419> hold<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> Lightning<00:02:07.349> wand

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
so go ahead and hold the Lightning wand

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
so go ahead and hold the Lightning wand
in<00:02:07.829> your<00:02:07.889> hand<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.599> right-click<00:02:09.599> wherever

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
you want the lightning to strike in this

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.440 
you want the lightning to strike in this
case<00:02:12.090> we'll<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.510> sit<00:02:12.719> down<00:02:12.989> right<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:13.290> and

supposed to happen there was a glitch

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800 
supposed to happen there was a glitch
either<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:25.430> though<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.150> pretty<00:02:26.360> fun<00:02:26.599> and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
either way though is so pretty fun and

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.150 
either way though is so pretty fun and
said<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> bunch<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.349> lightning<00:02:27.739> strikes<00:02:27.980> down

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
said a bunch of lightning strikes down

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.670 
said a bunch of lightning strikes down
pack<00:02:28.849> as<00:02:29.060> well<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.840> something<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.349> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
pack as well that's something to do and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.650 
pack as well that's something to do and
does<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.400> go<00:02:31.489> ahead<00:02:31.640> move<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.970> now<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.390> show

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
does it go ahead move on now and show

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780 
does it go ahead move on now and show
you<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.080> next<00:02:33.230> block<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:34.160> Spock<00:02:34.459> we<00:02:34.610> have

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
you the next block that Spock we have

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.270 
you the next block that Spock we have
here<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.180> called<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.810> steel<00:02:36.140> block<00:02:36.349> it's<00:02:36.650> made

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
here is called the steel block it's made

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.610 
here is called the steel block it's made
the<00:02:37.459> same<00:02:37.670> way<00:02:37.880> as<00:02:38.060> an<00:02:38.209> iron<00:02:38.420> block<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.930> except

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the same way as an iron block is except

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.009 
the same way as an iron block is except
that's<00:02:39.739> made<00:02:39.980> out<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.190> steel<00:02:40.790> aids<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.330> as<00:02:41.930> you

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
that's made out of steel aids and as you

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.880 
that's made out of steel aids and as you
can<00:02:42.110> see<00:02:42.170> there's<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.560> major<00:02:42.739> difference

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
can see there's a major difference

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.089 
can see there's a major difference
between<00:02:43.250> an<00:02:43.580> iron<00:02:43.819> block<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.360> still<00:02:44.830> block<00:02:45.830> is

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
between an iron block and still block is

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:47.890 
between an iron block and still block is
that<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.549> steel<00:02:46.849> block<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.299> looking<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.810> little

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
that a steel block is looking a little

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.960 
that a steel block is looking a little
more<00:02:48.140> dull<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.580> can<00:02:49.700> use<00:02:49.849> this

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
more dull and that you can use this

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.210 
more dull and that you can use this
block<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.290> build<00:02:51.530> some<00:02:51.799> buildings

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
block to you know build some buildings

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.520 
block to you know build some buildings
and<00:02:52.430> those<00:02:52.640> stuff<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> next<00:02:54.140> blog<00:02:54.410> we

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and those stuff like that next blog we

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.440 
and those stuff like that next blog we
have<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:54.950> called<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.370> glass<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.060> forced

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
have here is called the glass and forced

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.990 
have here is called the glass and forced
no<00:02:56.690> I'm<00:02:56.750> still<00:02:57.019> in<00:02:57.260> force<00:02:57.799> glass<00:02:58.280> my<00:02:58.549> bed<00:02:58.730> as

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
no I'm still in force glass my bed as

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.300 
no I'm still in force glass my bed as
you<00:02:59.569> can<00:02:59.660> see<00:02:59.870> here<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.500> pretty<00:03:00.709> much<00:03:00.920> glass

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
you can see here it's pretty much glass

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.190 
you can see here it's pretty much glass
with<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:01.849> black<00:03:02.180> lines<00:03:02.599> on<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.170> that

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
with some black lines on it and that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.400 
with some black lines on it and that
with<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.069> glass<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.670> can<00:03:04.700> probably<00:03:05.410> make

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
with this glass you can probably make

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.020 
with this glass you can probably make
like<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> jail<00:03:06.980> building<00:03:07.640> out<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.849> it<00:03:07.940> or

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
like a jail building out of it or

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.000 
like a jail building out of it or
something<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:09.980> see

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
something like that and as you can see

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.620 
something like that and as you can see
it's<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.790> little<00:03:10.970> bit<00:03:11.060> stronger<00:03:11.269> than<00:03:11.510> regular

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it's a little bit stronger than regular

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.930 
it's a little bit stronger than regular
glass<00:03:12.079> but<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.620> pretty<00:03:12.829> cool<00:03:13.040> stuff<00:03:13.280> it's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
glass but it's a pretty cool stuff it's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.750 
glass but it's a pretty cool stuff it's
going<00:03:14.299> on<00:03:14.420> now<00:03:14.480> to<00:03:14.690> steel<00:03:15.349> spikes<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:16.099> spice

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
going on now to steel spikes I spice

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.580 
going on now to steel spikes I spice
these<00:03:17.000> bugs<00:03:17.299> down<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> ground<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.349> that

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
these bugs down on the ground in that

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.050 
these bugs down on the ground in that
give<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.100> look<00:03:19.280> at<00:03:19.489> what<00:03:19.670> they<00:03:19.819> look<00:03:20.030> like

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
give you a look at what they look like
