 the movement of small farmers and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.420
 permanent campaign against 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.290
 pesticides and for life 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.320
 elements for agroecological transition 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 pig over bed 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.119
 the breeding system for animals 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.730
 bed and generate well-being for the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.869
 animals generates a good amount of fertilizer 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.869
 organic on property 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.190
 this adding to non-fish values gives 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.190
 outside students account do not enter here 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.280
 bye 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.699
 here our pigsty has this detail 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.369
 which is a step of that part here instead 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.149
 garlic is higher 50cm more 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.610
 high than the sty background 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.780
 here is two meters wide and here 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.509
 one meter half a meter so that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.970
 gives a cubic meter more or less 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.549
 bed space 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.649
 we use wood shavings here and it is very 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.960
 interesting and you can see the 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.590
 animals like to mess it up it warm up 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.119
 becomes hot and therefore greatly reduces the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.550
 You can see that here in the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.539
 Lighter has no music and animals 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.380
 they are very sweet as they play a lot 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:53.050
 there and in about three to four months 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.440
 We have a fertilizer ready for us here. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.720
 in the city ​​is very important because 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.200
 people save on fertilizer for the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.640
 plant generates ti besides generating comfort 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.849
 of the animals are here we can have 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.390
 a clearer notion of what the hole looks like 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.720
 to form khan and now I'm going to put 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 So 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.160
 behind 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.440
 material that has been removed from 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.930
 and swine 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.180
 He is not quite ready yet. 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.310
 still to be used in the sun 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.380
 the effective micro-organisms is that 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.540
 it will help in the process of 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.870
 acceleration of decomposition of this 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.699
 material as well revolver him each to 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.169
 every two three days that this too 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:02.479
 will potentiate him 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.160
 accompanies faster will have almost 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.860
 ready then about 15 or so 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.639
 20 days will be ready already to be 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.500
 used in the vegetables on the streets in 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.700
 potted plants or someone the peasant 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.700
 find it necessary
