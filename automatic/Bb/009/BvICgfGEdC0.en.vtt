00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
right here 780 and they make a shorter

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
30,000 shorter I don't know how much

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.490 
30,000 shorter I don't know how much
shorter<00:00:55.260> length<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:58.140> might<00:00:58.350> be

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
shorter length we need but that might be

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.729 
shorter length we need but that might be
what<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.739> need<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> anyway<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> figure

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
what we need but anyway we got to figure

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
what we need but anyway we got to figure
out<00:01:01.859> over<00:01:02.070> overhangs<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:04.430> these<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.640> one

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
out over overhangs here these are one

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
out over overhangs here these are one
point<00:01:06.390> 800<00:01:06.780> flashes<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.500> they're<00:01:07.650> bigger<00:01:07.860> than

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
point 800 flashes so they're bigger than

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940 
point 800 flashes so they're bigger than
early<00:01:08.540> let's<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.720> these<00:01:09.840> special<00:01:10.290> Center

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
early let's take these special Center

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.149 
early let's take these special Center
rings<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.110> got<00:01:13.229> any<00:01:13.320> terminal<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.770> got<00:01:13.950> here

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
rings so we got any terminal we got here

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.480 

Tony's<00:01:43.140> teams<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.890> definitely<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.729> one

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
Tony's teams this is definitely that one

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.859 
Tony's teams this is definitely that one
this<00:01:47.490> group<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.270> definitely<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.720> real

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
this group here is definitely the real

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.800 
this group here is definitely the real
thin<00:01:49.170> ones

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.389 

my<00:01:54.810> BIOS<00:01:55.140> notes<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> say<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.039> fit<00:01:56.219> there

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
my BIOS notes and I say they fit there

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.440 
my BIOS notes and I say they fit there
okay<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.310> problem<00:02:02.789> is<00:02:02.909> when<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.149> take<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
okay the problem is when you take the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.509 
okay the problem is when you take the
big<00:02:03.600> fat<00:02:03.930> from<00:02:06.679> squeezing<00:02:07.679> on<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> big-ass

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
big fat from squeezing on a big-ass

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.059 
big fat from squeezing on a big-ass
manifold<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:13.050> see<00:02:13.290> how<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.380> flange<00:02:13.860> is

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
manifold here you see how the flange is

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729 
manifold here you see how the flange is
way<00:02:14.340> off<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.819> edge<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.080> can't<00:02:16.380> tighten<00:02:16.590> it

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
way off the edge so you can't tighten it

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:26.809 
way off the edge so you can't tighten it
up<00:02:21.769> get<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.890> correct<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.340> on<00:02:23.459> there<00:02:25.819> you're

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
up get the correct one on there you're

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.150 
up get the correct one on there you're
still<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.209> hard<00:02:30.170> see<00:02:31.170> they're<00:02:31.380> closer<00:02:31.920> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
still going hard see they're closer to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.410 
still going hard see they're closer to
being<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.549> edge<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.000> then<00:02:33.150> when<00:02:33.390> you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
being on the edge so then when you

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.830 
being on the edge so then when you
tighten<00:02:33.750> up<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.019> be<00:02:34.140> almost<00:02:34.319> full<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:35.840> suppose

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
tighten up to be almost full up suppose

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
tighten up to be almost full up suppose
those<00:02:36.959> other<00:02:37.080> ones<00:02:37.230> were<00:02:37.349> down<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.280> these

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
those other ones were down here these

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.699 
those other ones were down here these
ones<00:02:38.519> are<00:02:38.670> over<00:02:38.819> here<00:02:39.290> that's<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.380> difference

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
ones are over here that's the difference

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.339 
ones are over here that's the difference
in<00:02:40.830> these<00:02:40.980> things<00:02:42.590> we're<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.680> using<00:02:43.890> those

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
in these things we're not using those

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.860 
in these things we're not using those
alright<00:02:46.349> so<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.560> got<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.709> figure<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.040> so

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
alright so you got to figure that out so

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.569 
alright so you got to figure that out so
we<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.319> shortness<00:02:49.799> manifold<00:02:50.310> up<00:02:50.459> a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
we go to a shortness manifold up a

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.970 
we go to a shortness manifold up a
little<00:02:50.730> bit<00:02:51.290> which<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.319> why<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.620> want<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.860> see

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
little bit which is why I want to see

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.890 
little bit which is why I want to see
how<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.519> shorten<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.690> looks<00:02:54.840> like

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
how much I can shorten it it looks like

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
how much I can shorten it it looks like
we<00:02:55.140> do<00:02:55.260> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.470> little<00:02:55.680> room<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.519> do<00:02:56.940> some

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
we do have a little room to do some

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.830 
we do have a little room to do some
shoring<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:59.299> let<00:03:00.299> me<00:03:00.359> see<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.720> figure

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
shoring so let me see if we can figure

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.020 
shoring so let me see if we can figure
how<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.459> exactly<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
how to do this it's not exactly the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.759 
how to do this it's not exactly the
easiest<00:03:03.239> thing<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.750> works<00:03:03.810> hold<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.530> so

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
easiest thing and it works hold on to so

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.309 
easiest thing and it works hold on to so
I<00:03:04.829> can<00:03:04.920> sleeping<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.549> way<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.730> doing<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
I can sleeping for your way of doing it

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.479 
I can sleeping for your way of doing it
we've<00:03:07.319> got<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.500> make<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.620> shorter<00:03:07.980> manifold

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
we've got to make a shorter manifold

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.160 
we've got to make a shorter manifold
what<00:03:08.940> we're<00:03:09.030> gonna<00:03:09.120> buy<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.389> mouthful<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
what we're gonna buy this mouthful and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.309 
what we're gonna buy this mouthful and
see<00:03:10.350> if<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.310> right<00:03:11.489> length<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:12.319> either

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
see if it is the right length but either

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.750 
see if it is the right length but either
way<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> gotta<00:03:13.769> make<00:03:13.980> these<00:03:14.160> things<00:03:14.370> shorter

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
way I gotta make these things shorter

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.430 
way I gotta make these things shorter
grinding<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.569> not<00:03:15.780> very<00:03:15.930> Agra<00:03:16.290> because

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
grinding that's not very Agra because

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.309 
grinding that's not very Agra because
they're<00:03:16.530> uneven<00:03:16.769> as<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.040> grind<00:03:17.340> but<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:19.049> might

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
they're uneven as you grind but it might

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.830 
they're uneven as you grind but it might
be<00:03:19.470> our<00:03:19.560> option<00:03:19.889> -<00:03:20.040> we'll<00:03:20.370> see<00:03:20.579> yeah<00:03:21.329> we'll<00:03:21.720> see

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
be our option - we'll see yeah we'll see

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.319 
be our option - we'll see yeah we'll see
what<00:03:21.959> happened<00:03:22.200> next
