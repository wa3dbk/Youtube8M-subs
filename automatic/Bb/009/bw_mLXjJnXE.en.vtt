00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.720
 halo is finally finally time for 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.550
 new make-up once I already have 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 eternity made i do not know that 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.929
 really why did not come to me at the end 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.599
 but now I'm back with one 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 and it's about colorful eyeshadows today 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 colorful eye make-up anything 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
 is colorful and on the eyes and him ins 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.619
 can wear without completely overpainted 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.210
 to look like a clown 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 you know so much like colorful 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 Enke and also a bit unusual 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 things but I would like to anticipate 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 you can say all sorts of things 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 colors also clap if it is you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 like it is perfectly ok 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.590
 Of course, it can look great, too 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.899
 you put a lot of colors on your eyes 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 thunders and completely against everything 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.379
 violating the talk now will 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.789
 it's not about that now that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.420
 nonplusultra is that we necessarily like that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.309
 have to do 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.469
 it 's more about it if you do not 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.270
 really self-aware and not 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 really knows if it is a fixed one 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.480
 can wear or for people just yet 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.739
 not often worn colors just have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 want to try a little bit 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.890
 want to start a bit with it so for 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.420
 Such today is this video as I said 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 you definitely do not have to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.690
 Do as I say now you can do that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.040
 Just wear it as he would like 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 few suggestions for people who do not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.250
 quite sure the methods are number 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.260
 One is for everyone I am 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 make it dearest and that is easy 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.490
 down eyeliner to use that one 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.900
 Pretty cool style a bit color 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.549
 to get to the eye there is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 in the meantime, there are really many g 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.210
 one in different colors 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 but you can also use eyeshadow in 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 a knit can do a lot too 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 Let's apply what works 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 also there are many possibilities 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.180
 how to combine something like that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 I would say the easiest way is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 simply neutral song drive to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.670
 make-up so a bit stress but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.740
 nothing for very neutral everything best 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.479
 still dull colors and then just with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.479
 an eyeliner to accent 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.780
 if he does not have the complete one 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.299
 you can pull there, for example 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.249
 just take a bit of paint outside 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.780
 I have already blocked these 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:02.090
 done very often and that works 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.500
 wonderful another way the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.509
 a little less noticeable but than 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.009
 Pretty cool is just paint on 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.360
 the waterline apply here too 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.840
 can you go alone or use 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 Certainly there are very very beautiful colorful ones 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.110
 Meanwhile, for example , from 42 have been there 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 I also log in a user 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.440
 you want to reinforce a bit too 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.180
 For example, working in winter mascara 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.709
 which I think is very cool there 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.290
 just a little bit in radiant 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.920
 color in the eye in the truest sense of the word 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 , word 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.220
 and it just looks cool 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.750
 interesting from suddenly quite so good 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.250
 like because it just is not so good on 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.480
 wear also has the waterline 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890
 because you can do it in the lower one too 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.079
 make eyelash wreath fits at all 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.940
 do not pull down too thick on top 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.950
 There's nothing like you have to go up like that 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.319
 balance something in the dark 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.170
 colors or even elongated colors 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.640
 concerns is for example in a ran 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.609
 a little bit smokey eyes 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 or something, and to the bottom a color 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.090
 on the eyelashes I show yes 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 even an example always look that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.690
 it then back especially the very good 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.579
 is led together with different 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.750
 for example, everyone paints a pink 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.609
 take that to the outside so one 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.139
 a little darker a bit 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.150
 brownish may also need 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.709
 simply a blended is a beautiful one 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.950
 is transition and then also fits all 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.950
 Well 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.950
 who is really brave and is the color 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.760
 wants to pack on speed so in the form of 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.560
 eye shadow 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.510
 the trick is very 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.790
 hide neutral colors that is 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.800
 For example, if you are a leader smokie 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.470
 then you should make up 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.180
 Leather not with purple or blue or pink 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.100
 or hide red but best 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.690
 It is best with a brown tone 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.880
 if you change the color on moving lid 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.590
 sets and left behind and above 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.940
 The eyelid folds a bit with brown or 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 any other neutral tones 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.170
 hide best also matte colors 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.760
 because it works in my opinion 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.900
 but best of all you have free 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.130
 hand what you can of course watch 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.740
 simply you liked the most 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.270
 but if you like colorful league colors 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.950
 then please do not grapple with the colorful 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.840
 to hide color simply with in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.400
 neutral colors deserve the whole thing 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.710
 a bit and it is not quite so 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.240
 someone wants out of now 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.190
 you still feel really brave and 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.140
 really something really special 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.270
 we are a bit flashier 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.190
 but again not too much 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.810
 put the colors in angle 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.910
 it sounds scary at first 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.200
 not so easy to implement but it 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.670
 Looks really cool from quite well done 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.200
 you have to be careful that you 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.960
 no too dark color takes on 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.580
 best pastels bright tones maybe 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.140
 also a bit that looks cool too 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.820
 This is really important for that 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.830
 rest of the look to take the colors 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.450
 nice to harmonize with that do not have to 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.500
 times necessarily be completely neutral than 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.570
 I have here for example also in 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.790
 Liege with the below still had purple 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.950
 which of course is colorful but has it 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.510
 I think I harmonize very well together 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.300
 yes, those were a few ideas like you 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.980
 color also gets it completely closed 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 overloaded and if you know us now 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.100
 You can start a color like that and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.660
 just play around a bit and 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.160
 a little bit of world rapt attention 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.030
 actually can enter all kinds 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.630
 you like in the comments 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.400
 write 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.410
 because that therefore the occurred to me 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.910
 but it may well be yes because 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.230
 should there a few times more this 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.880
 you would assume something like me 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.630
 I'm really looking forward to tabletop 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.940
 instance for example then i would 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.900
 I like to watch and then I could 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.340
 the on my last two videos 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.290
 You can also click below in the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.850
 infobox after the neckermann 1 playlist 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.860
 look because I have a whole here 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.030
 playlist for that you can do everything possible 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.470
 see what I have already done if 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.850
 you liked the deep or helped 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.230
 really valued or very good 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.790
 Comment if any 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.290
 desire stand for a make-up once 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.210
 would have to write then, here are the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.410
 Comments in a video is planned 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.150
 but that's a bit more involved 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.320
 When I thought I was very happy 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.700
