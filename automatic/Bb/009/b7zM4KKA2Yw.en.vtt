00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.150 
have two PCI 16x lots however when
you're<00:02:13.959> using<00:02:14.170> both<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.590> them<00:02:14.769> at<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.010> same

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
you're using both of them at the same

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.479 
you're using both of them at the same
time<00:02:15.580> they<00:02:16.150> are<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.930> them<00:02:17.110> runs<00:02:17.379> at<00:02:17.560> 4x<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
time they are one of them runs at 4x so

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.089 
time they are one of them runs at 4x so
keep<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.910> mind<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.140> all<00:02:20.709> of

8<00:02:59.349> pin<00:02:59.590> power<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.209> like<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.299> said<00:03:01.359> plenty<00:03:01.810> room

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
8 pin power here like I said plenty room

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.330 
8 pin power here like I said plenty room
around<00:03:02.170> as<00:03:02.319> if<00:03:02.440> oh<00:03:02.590> actually<00:03:02.799> not<00:03:03.069> that<00:03:03.099> much

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.729 
PCI 1x lots now I used to think that
these<00:03:58.389> were<00:03:58.599> pointless<00:03:58.930> until<00:03:59.410> they<00:03:59.500> came<00:03:59.680> out

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
these were pointless until they came out

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.759 
these were pointless until they came out
with<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.220> pci<00:04:00.609> card<00:04:01.480> drives<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.169> revo<00:04:02.500> drives

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
with the pci card drives the revo drives

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.979 
with the pci card drives the revo drives
so<00:04:03.340> those<00:04:03.489> are<00:04:03.609> pretty<00:04:03.699> awesome<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.630> have<00:04:04.750> now

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
so those are pretty awesome to have now

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:05.710 
so those are pretty awesome to have now
