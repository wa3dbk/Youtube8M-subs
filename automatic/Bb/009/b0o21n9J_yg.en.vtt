00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580 
configuration so they mount in four
different<00:01:38.850> spots<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.659> once<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.320> them

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
different spots but once you get them

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.350 
different spots but once you get them
put<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.100> place<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.909> cinch<00:01:42.180> them<00:01:42.299> down

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
put into place and you cinch them down

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
put into place and you cinch them down
that<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that first time you get it just how you

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
that first time you get it just how you
like<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.369> getting<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> out<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.689> brace

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
like it getting in and out of the brace

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
like it getting in and out of the brace
is<00:01:46.049> much<00:01:46.200> easier<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> only<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> activate

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
is much easier you only have to activate

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
is much easier you only have to activate
these<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.299> red<00:01:48.570> buttons<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.290> pop<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.770> very

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these two red buttons they pop out very

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
these two red buttons they pop out very
easily<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.729> allows<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
easily that allows you in and out of the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
easily that allows you in and out of the
brace<00:01:51.810> without<00:01:52.110> having<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> adjust<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> eight

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
brace without having to adjust the eight

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.670 
brace without having to adjust the eight
different<00:01:53.399> positions<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.570> cool<00:01:54.810> other

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
different positions so very cool other

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.670 
different positions so very cool other
other<00:01:56.310> ways<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.880> adjust<00:01:57.240> this

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
other ways that you can adjust this

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
other ways that you can adjust this
first<00:01:58.680> off<00:01:58.860> our<00:01:59.100> stance<00:01:59.850> sometimes<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.479> have

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
first off our stance sometimes we have

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
first off our stance sometimes we have
our<00:02:00.750> knees<00:02:00.960> toed<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.710> sometimes<00:02:02.070> our

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
our knees toed in and sometimes our

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280 
our knees toed in and sometimes our
knees<00:02:02.369> bow<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.390> has<00:02:03.570> some<00:02:03.780> adjustments

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
knees bow out this has some adjustments

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
knees bow out this has some adjustments
that<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.040> place<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.610> can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that you can put in place that you can

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.399 
that you can put in place that you can
accommodate<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.570> well<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.170> very

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
accommodate that as well that's very

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.850 
accommodate that as well that's very
important<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.399> also<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.259> hinges<00:02:10.649> there's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
important but also on the hinges there's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
important but also on the hinges there's
a<00:02:10.920> series<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.420> braces<00:02:12.420> as<00:02:12.540> well<00:02:12.690> or<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> series

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
a series of braces as well or a series

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.760 
a series of braces as well or a series
of<00:02:13.170> adjustments

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
of adjustments

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
of adjustments
so<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:14.280> red<00:02:14.550> tabs<00:02:14.850> these<00:02:15.330> come<00:02:15.600> in

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so these little red tabs these come in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
so these little red tabs these come in
five<00:02:16.020> degree<00:02:16.500> increments<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.100> these<00:02:17.430> are

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
five degree increments and these are

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.010 
five degree increments and these are
going<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.600> stops<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.990> from

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
going to be what stops you from

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.590 
going to be what stops you from
hyperextending<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:19.830> knee<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.490> zero<00:02:21.330> degree

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
hyperextending your knee so zero degree

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.930 
hyperextending your knee so zero degree
comes<00:02:21.870> installed<00:02:22.320> but<00:02:22.740> then<00:02:22.860> there's<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.100> 5<00:02:23.370> 10

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
comes installed but then there's a 5 10

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.820 
comes installed but then there's a 5 10
15<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.750> 20<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.170> basically<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.710> does

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
15 and 20 and basically what that does

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.010 
15 and 20 and basically what that does
is<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.280> prevents<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.850> knee<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.600> ever<00:02:27.780> going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
is it prevents your knee from ever going

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.810 
is it prevents your knee from ever going
the<00:02:28.590> wrong<00:02:28.770> direction<00:02:28.830> so<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:29.670> really

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the wrong direction so it's really

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.960 
the wrong direction so it's really
important<00:02:30.270> now<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.650> most<00:02:31.860> critical<00:02:32.520> point<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
important now the most critical point of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.180 
important now the most critical point of
a<00:02:33.330> knee<00:02:33.510> brace<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> way<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.440> touches<00:02:34.890> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
a knee brace is the way it touches the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.980 
a knee brace is the way it touches the
outside<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.850> inside<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.390> knees<00:02:36.630> these

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
outside and inside of your knees these

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.290 
outside and inside of your knees these
pads<00:02:37.380> right<00:02:37.770> here<00:02:38.070> there<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.850> space<00:02:39.060> or

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
pads right here there are some space or

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
pads right here there are some space or
adjustments<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:39.960> one<00:02:40.230> two<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.770> three

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
adjustments there's one two and three

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
adjustments there's one two and three
millimeter<00:02:41.400> spacers<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.930> actually

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
millimeter spacers so you can actually

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080 
millimeter spacers so you can actually
shim<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.680> thing<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.400> fit<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> way

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
shim that thing out to fit you the way

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
shim that thing out to fit you the way
you<00:02:45.150> need<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.350> lot<00:02:46.530> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
you need it to really a lot of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280 
you need it to really a lot of
adjustability<00:02:47.070> for<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.690> set<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.810> braces<00:02:48.990> that's

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
adjustability for a set of braces that's

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.810 
adjustability for a set of braces that's
value-packed<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.100> very<00:02:50.160> much<00:02:50.490> appreciate

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
value-packed so I very much appreciate

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.720 
value-packed so I very much appreciate
that<00:02:51.540> let's<00:02:52.380> talk<00:02:52.530> about<00:02:52.680> sizing<00:02:53.220> they<00:02:53.520> come

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
that let's talk about sizing they come

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.610 
that let's talk about sizing they come
in<00:02:53.850> two<00:02:54.000> different<00:02:54.030> sizes<00:02:54.330> there's<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.200> small

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
in two different sizes there's a small

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.500 
in two different sizes there's a small
medium<00:02:55.980> large<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.490> then<00:02:56.820> there's<00:02:57.030> an<00:02:57.210> extra

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
medium large and then there's an extra

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.510 
medium large and then there's an extra
large<00:02:57.690> double<00:02:58.230> XL<00:02:58.740> for<00:02:59.010> guys<00:02:59.130> with<00:02:59.280> bigger

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
large double XL for guys with bigger

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.870 
large double XL for guys with bigger
knees<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.770> take<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.920> into<00:03:02.040> account<00:03:02.070> there's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
knees so take that into account there's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.430 
knees so take that into account there's
those<00:03:03.030> two<00:03:03.240> sizes<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.020> why<00:03:04.230> they

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
those two sizes and that's why they

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.140 
those two sizes and that's why they
offer<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:04.950> much<00:03:05.070> adjustability<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.030> if

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
offer so much adjustability so that if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.550 
offer so much adjustability so that if
you're<00:03:06.270> somewhere<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.690> between<00:03:06.810> those<00:03:07.200> ranges

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
you're somewhere in between those ranges

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.780 
you're somewhere in between those ranges
you're<00:03:07.740> gonna<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.070> able<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.550> fit

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you're gonna be able to get it to fit

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.210 
you're gonna be able to get it to fit
you<00:03:08.910> correctly<00:03:09.860> something<00:03:10.860> else<00:03:11.010> that's

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
you correctly something else that's
