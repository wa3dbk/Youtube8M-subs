00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.930

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.200

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.530

 I have not made any mess, I'm not going either 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:45.440
 seeing the minimum points for 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:49.270
 arrive if it is much longer May 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.270
 We've also done a little water 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.190
 twenty 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.250
 two 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.590
 on the way 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.680
 lend the turbo the balls he has 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.709
 passed from 0 to 10 modes the dance round 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.280
 and incredible the races are me 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.220
 they love fucking guys have hit me with the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.840
 gas station ate me uncle cheat 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.890
 whoever made the race have put 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:44.349
 a fence the race until with which 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:48.209
 I think they have put me a fence uncle 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.209
 to go through the gas station 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.129
 this is from the creators of the races 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.819
 but when he has killed himself 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.389
 I would have expected 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.050
 leave the race gentlemen 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.760
 they cross me in the fucking rafael but that 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.760
 says everything 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 m 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.170
 philip h 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.410
 new york the other idea 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.410
 to the river 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:25.100
 etc because then I was doing it 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.130
 very bad because I have two places left 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.130
 time 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.690
 let's go looping sir 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.160
 incredible the last looping that threw him 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.710
 all the first perfect boy is 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.150
 incredible the incredible trunk where 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.150
 it goes that there 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:08.940
 in the environment where twice I have 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.940
 gone to the top and not any 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.860
 Now I 'm not here, it's back here, uncle 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.040
 is passing access 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:33.770
 not because they have medium 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:38.230
 I'm going to see you have finished and missed what 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.230
 more advanced 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.870
 amazing 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.940
 it is not impossible 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:25.150
 for that you just do not crash if you go with him 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.150
 with the got with the turbo 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.610
 parking are riddling the 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.380
 analogy I do not make myself my perfect something 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.390
 now if they kill him 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.940
 but those mother glitters will make me more bad 

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.940
 what to use until we are now
