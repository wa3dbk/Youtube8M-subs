00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.350
 hello today there will be video shopping 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 tell you about these three remedies of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.980
 summer collection that I bought 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.820
 certainly late summer but better late 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 than never 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.700
 Let's start here with this browser from Clarence 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.950
 since this is the only spontaneous 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.320
 I wanted to buy this bronzer 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.840
 buy as soon as I saw the summer release 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.239
 I really liked the clarence collection 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.400
 Making an interesting drawing on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.500
 cap 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.710
 browser and it repeats itself at the very 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.409
 what browser is interesting what browser 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.589
 non-uniform and there are transitions from more 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.360
 light darker shade also 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.280
 there is a highlighter but when you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.610
 put this browser on your face 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.839
 He absolutely does not shine 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.180
 2-3 times now with this bronzer too 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.370
 I put on the face that I can say 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 bronzer is very pigmented even 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.930
 more pigmented than this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 moment is my favorite bronzer 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 from gerlen from the terracotta collection that is 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.730
 This bronzer I put once and after 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.010
 this shade in order for it 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.270
 looked natural since i 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.610
 snow white and what you see now is 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.010
 I'm looking tanned for me is very important 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 to bronzer instead went to spots 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.520
 shade well 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 this browser is shaded brilliantly 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.870
 the only thing that seemed to me that he 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.910
 a little bit lies quite a bit 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.910
 but as they say the first impression 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.250
 I am still buying pretty 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.330
 big here's a mirror here that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.700
 comfortable and as much as 20 grams of product what 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.840
 very much so that's enough for you all 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.060
 remaining life 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.850
 2 purchase is powder from chanel of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340
 collection loving shades 01 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.819
 shade 02 I would surely be dark 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.769
 so I chose shade 01 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.900
 so here is the packaging goes in 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.700
 so here dust collectors who do not know much 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.409
 girls are not such dust collectors 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 like me not absolutely annoying 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.989
 similar things so she does not know herself 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.560
 packaging seems to me so stylish and 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.480
 succinctly and that it is practically for me 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.900
 brilliant Chanel goes on like this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.109
 here is a big mirror which is very comfortable and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.719
 the set is also present here such 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.999
 the brush the brush is really very 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.680
 soft even was surprised by this 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.499
 soft brush set that ever 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 I saw further comes here such protection 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:56.060
 and already powder which represents 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.340
 the so-called mattress of three shades 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.019
 I used powder three or four times 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.450
 and very dissatisfied she is translucent then 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.219
 have it in no way changes 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.779
 colors 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:14.810
 your tonal means and she doesn't 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:17.370
 illuminating it gives such an effect 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.169
 photoshop feels like 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.510
 before you post a photo in 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.340
 instagram you impose a filter yes for 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.040
 the fact that your skin looked more 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.489
 a well-groomed groomed precisely such 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.049
 the effect gives this powder after its application 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.939
 skin so rested so sleek 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.279
 such some kind of effect 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.859
 so here will be real photoshop 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:43.379
 so I am very pleased with this purchase 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.409
 more than sure that this powder will be 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.799
 my favorite and 3 purchase from summer 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.950
 collections are shadows from the collection 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.469
 diorshow mono honestly not very me 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.700
 I like monna shadows more conveniently 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.099
 use me 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.180
 but I just donâ€™t go past that color 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.699
 could shade I look like 167 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.249
 salt shadow 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:11.010
 decorated again in the same 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:12.480
 dust collectors here packaging itself too 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 quite concisely 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.100
 It seems to me a little bulky further 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.830
 big mirror and already go here 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.139
 absolutely useless disputes and color itself and 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.550
 know the light I really liked even 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.030
 despite the fact that I am huge 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.260
 number of shadows I can say that such 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.000
 I don't have colors in one palette 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 You know, I can add that they are very 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.160
 pigmented look nothing 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.470
 I have not seen this for a very long time 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.600
 very good pigmentation shadow 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.210
 keeps well applied 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.580
 perfectly shade that is just 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.530
 magnificent and never regretted that I 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 bought if you like 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.479
 shades as I need 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.760

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.680
 show today but this is no longer a purchase 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.660
 this is a gift which is even more pleasant 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.760
 gave it to me my girlfriend is 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.000
 lash growth remedy for trash 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.949
 lateral immediately when I say 3 cm who 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.740
 the parties remember unfortunately the mascara I 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.470
 did not try really want to try but 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.130
 there will be back yes this is a means to grow 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.389
 eyelashes 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:26.130
 She goes to such a silver tuba with 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:29.120
 small here is such small 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.010
 brush apply this tool before 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.280
 sleep when removing eye makeup and 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.789
 apply very carefully on the line on 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.770
 Growth line of your eyelashes says that 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.000
 the tool should last for three months 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.430
 have three months of use 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.610
 This product your eyelashes should be 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.410
 thicker longer while i'm 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.539

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.030
 so I can say nothing but 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.070
 no allergies or tingling 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.180
