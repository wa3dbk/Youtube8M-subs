modes you can put him in gun reform or

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.300 
modes you can put him in gun reform or
sprinter<00:01:44.850> form<00:01:45.060> gun<00:01:45.749> reform<00:01:46.079> allows<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.189> use

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
sprinter form gun reform allows to use

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
sprinter form gun reform allows to use
two<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.759> wing<00:01:47.909> pieces<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.840> little

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
two little wing pieces up here as little

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.520 
two little wing pieces up here as little
supports<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.579> use<00:01:51.389> as<00:01:51.569> a<00:01:51.600> makeshift<00:01:51.990> magazine

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
supports to use as a makeshift magazine

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
supports to use as a makeshift magazine
and<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.399> sprinter<00:01:53.759> form<00:01:53.969> has<00:01:54.179> them<00:01:54.359> reclined

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and the sprinter form has them reclined

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.340 
and the sprinter form has them reclined
down<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.159> guess<00:01:56.749> easier<00:01:57.749> control<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> don't

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
down for I guess easier control I don't

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.690 
down for I guess easier control I don't
know<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.889> it<00:01:59.039> makes<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.310> sense<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.609> have

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
know I think it makes more sense to have

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.609 
know I think it makes more sense to have
them<00:01:59.880> like<00:01:59.999> that<00:02:00.170> honestly<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.590> really

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
them like that honestly there's really

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
them like that honestly there's really
no<00:02:01.859> difference<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.549> think<00:02:02.670> gun<00:02:02.909> reform<00:02:03.209> is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
no difference so I think gun reform is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.399 
no difference so I think gun reform is
probably<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.569> only<00:02:03.719> form<00:02:03.929> you<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.109> need

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
probably the only form you really need

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.260 
probably the only form you really need
if<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.249> were<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.520> use<00:02:05.639> him<00:02:08.060> again<00:02:09.060> another

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
if you were to use him again another

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.260 
if you were to use him again another

knows<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.250> might<00:03:15.370> do<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.519> review<00:03:15.790> on<00:03:15.849> him<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.209> some

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
knows I might do a review on him at some

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.830 
knows I might do a review on him at some
point<00:03:16.389> but<00:03:16.950> that's<00:03:17.950> still<00:03:18.219> in<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.340> dark<00:03:18.840> since

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
point but that's still in the dark since

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.420 
point but that's still in the dark since
that's<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.290> box<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.659> b-daman

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that's the box and this is the b-daman

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.640 
that's the box and this is the b-daman
so<00:03:24.430> he<00:03:24.699> looks<00:03:24.879> really<00:03:25.239> nice<00:03:25.409> he's<00:03:26.409> got<00:03:26.470> a

black<00:03:40.060> stuff<00:03:40.329> back<00:03:40.510> here<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:42.239> yeah<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.599> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
black stuff back here and yeah so the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.469 
black stuff back here and yeah so the
this<00:03:44.109> stuff<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.699> cartridge<00:03:45.699> mechanism<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.269> a

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
this stuff the cartridge mechanism is a

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.849 
this stuff the cartridge mechanism is a
deep<00:03:46.720> dark<00:03:46.989> black<00:03:47.199> so<00:03:47.409> it's<00:03:47.530> kind<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.680> hard<00:03:47.769> to

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
deep dark black so it's kind of hard to

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.189 
deep dark black so it's kind of hard to
see<00:03:48.009> on<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.189> camera<00:03:48.459> here<00:03:48.609> but<00:03:49.079> basically<00:03:50.079> if

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
see on the camera here but basically if

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.999 
see on the camera here but basically if
you're<00:03:50.319> still<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.560> familiar<00:03:50.859> with<00:03:50.949> the

you're still in familiar with the

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.770 
you're still in familiar with the
cartridge<00:03:51.370> system<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:52.449> have<00:03:52.599> two

review<00:05:57.280> but<00:05:57.490> there's<00:05:58.090> actually<00:05:58.270> it's<00:05:59.020> just

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
review but there's actually it's just

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.670 
review but there's actually it's just
like<00:05:59.500> the<00:06:00.090> drive<00:06:01.090> core<00:06:02.080> basically<00:06:02.500> you've<00:06:02.650> got

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
like the drive core basically you've got

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.500 
like the drive core basically you've got
two<00:06:02.949> little<00:06:03.220> folding<00:06:03.610> pieces<00:06:03.909> inside<00:06:04.210> here

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
two little folding pieces inside here

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.810 
two little folding pieces inside here
and<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:05.139> got<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.289> little<00:06:05.560> rubber<00:06:05.800> one<00:06:06.099> at<00:06:06.430> the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
and you got a little rubber one at the

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.760 
and you got a little rubber one at the
bottom<00:06:07.150> so<00:06:07.449> they<00:06:07.750> all<00:06:07.930> pretty<00:06:08.260> much<00:06:08.380> share<00:06:08.560> the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
bottom so they all pretty much share the

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.080 
bottom so they all pretty much share the
same<00:06:09.720> firing<00:06:10.720> core<00:06:11.490> which<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.669> hadn't

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
same firing core which I hadn't

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.990 
same firing core which I hadn't
mentioned<00:06:13.180> before<00:06:13.630> but<00:06:13.810> they<00:06:13.900> do<00:06:14.010> and<00:06:15.010> that's

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
mentioned before but they do and that's

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.200 
mentioned before but they do and that's
pretty<00:06:16.210> much<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.599> the<00:06:17.409> stickers<00:06:17.770> again<00:06:18.210> are

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
pretty much it the stickers again are
