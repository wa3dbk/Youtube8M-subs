that they wanted to make sure that they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
that they wanted to make sure that they
can<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> money<00:00:47.969> making

glitches<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> game<00:00:49.800> before<00:00:50.070> they

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
glitches out of the game before they

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430

start<00:00:50.879> giving<00:00:51.030> money<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.110> way<00:00:52.260> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
start giving money out and that way we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
start giving money out and that way we
could<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.829> build<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.430> real<00:00:53.640> economy<00:00:54.000> and
