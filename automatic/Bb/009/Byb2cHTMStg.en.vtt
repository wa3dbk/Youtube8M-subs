process<00:01:57.539> was<00:01:57.689> incredibly<00:01:58.590> successful<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.340> us

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
process was incredibly successful for us

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.469 
process was incredibly successful for us
so<00:02:00.060> George<00:02:00.570> had<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.929> confidence<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:02.240> use<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
so George had the confidence to use that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
so George had the confidence to use that
same<00:02:03.689> technology<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.710> panther<00:02:04.979> myth<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
same technology in the panther myth and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.830 
same technology in the panther myth and
then<00:02:08.009> we've<00:02:08.130> come<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.399> stage<00:02:08.640> further<00:02:08.910> in

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
then we've come on stage further in

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.890 
then we've come on stage further in

Episode two is he shooting on digital
for<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> kind<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> films<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.920> George<00:02:14.340> makes

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
for the kind of films that George makes

for the kind of films that George makes
the<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.030> films<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:16.800> are

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the kind of films that we make we are

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.759 
the kind of films that we make we are
ostensibly<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> digital<00:02:18.870> arena<00:02:19.019> from<00:02:19.650> the

ostensibly in the digital arena from the
first<00:02:20.099> day<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:20.910> actually<00:02:21.090> start<00:02:21.450> working

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
first day that we actually start working

most<00:02:22.799> people<00:02:23.130> fail<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.640> realize<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.480> but

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
most people fail to realize this but

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.930 
most people fail to realize this but
basically<00:02:24.989> what<00:02:25.230> happens<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.739> every<00:02:25.940> single

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
basically what happens is every single

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.740 
basically what happens is every single
frame<00:02:27.920> every<00:02:28.920> single<00:02:29.340> shot<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.239> movie<00:02:30.569> as

frame every single shot in the movie as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.830

a<00:02:31.019> digital<00:02:31.319> effect<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.519> much<00:02:32.760> every<00:02:33.360> set

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
a digital effect pretty much every set

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.320 
a digital effect pretty much every set
has<00:02:34.530> blue<00:02:35.069> screen<00:02:35.340> even<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:35.880> out<00:02:36.180> of

I<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:40.500> I've<00:02:40.620> been<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.099> one<00:02:41.400> set<00:02:41.700> where<00:02:41.880> there

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I think I've been on one set where there

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
I think I've been on one set where there
hasn't<00:02:42.150> been<00:02:42.329> any<00:02:42.540> blue<00:02:42.780> screen<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.500> for<00:02:43.709> us<00:02:43.829> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
hasn't been any blue screen so for us to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
hasn't been any blue screen so for us to
shoot<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.400> film<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.569> scan<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.140> into<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.370 
shoot in film and then scan it into a
computer<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.280> ridiculous<00:02:47.940> process<00:02:48.420> right

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
computer is a ridiculous process right

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.289 
computer is a ridiculous process right
now<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.890> shoot<00:02:50.010> on<00:02:50.160> hi-def<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.790> 50

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
now we can shoot on hi-def and 50

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.460 
now we can shoot on hi-def and 50
minutes<00:02:51.540> after<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.870> shoot<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.079> 50<00:02:52.350> minute

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
several years to try to make it happen

several years to try to make it happen
and<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.620> could<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.359> cameras<00:03:21.750> built

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959

us the biggest difference with these

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.190 
us the biggest difference with these
cameras<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.299> they<00:03:33.420> were<00:03:33.480> developed<00:03:34.049> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
cameras is that they were developed to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.470 
cameras is that they were developed to
provide<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.620> 24<00:03:35.370> frames<00:03:35.639> per<00:03:35.790> second<00:03:36.180> frame

frame the next big problem that we had

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.070

better that has nothing to do with art
technology<00:05:53.010> is<00:05:53.159> used<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.610> tell<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:54.120> story<00:05:54.570> and

technology is used to tell a story and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.089 
technology is used to tell a story and
that's<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:55.440> whole<00:05:55.560> point

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
that's the whole point

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.530 
that's the whole point
it's<00:05:56.340> really

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
it's really

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.140 
it's really
the<00:05:57.870> filmmaker<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.250> storyteller<00:05:59.850> and

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
the filmmaker and the storyteller and

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.700 
the filmmaker and the storyteller and
how<00:06:00.660> well<00:06:00.870> they're<00:06:01.050> able<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.350> tell<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.650> story

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
how well they're able to tell the story

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.100 
how well they're able to tell the story
that<00:06:02.550> counts<00:06:02.760> in<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.120> end<00:06:03.270> that<00:06:03.660> the

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
that counts in the end that the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.690 
that counts in the end that the
techniques<00:06:04.590> they<00:06:04.800> use<00:06:05.010> are<00:06:05.340> really<00:06:05.580> a

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
techniques they use are really a

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.130 
techniques they use are really a
byproduct<00:06:06.570> of<00:06:06.870> that

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:07.140 
byproduct of that

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.380 
byproduct of that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
other puddle come in we'll take the gray

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.700 
other puddle come in we'll take the gray
pot<00:06:11.460> up<00:06:11.640> tonight<00:06:12.060> heads<00:06:12.570> and<00:06:13.230> we'll<00:06:13.440> start

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
pot up tonight heads and we'll start

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.240 
pot up tonight heads and we'll start
with<00:06:13.890> scene<00:06:14.130> 5<00:06:14.460> we<00:06:14.760> get<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.000> turn<00:06:15.890> so<00:06:16.890> that's<00:06:17.070> a

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
with scene 5 we get the turn so that's a

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.430 
with scene 5 we get the turn so that's a
wrap
