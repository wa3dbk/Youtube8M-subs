sure<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.710> only<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.759> minute<00:02:00.000> or

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
sure there was only I think a minute or

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
sure there was only I think a minute or
a<00:02:00.299> minute<00:02:00.600> 40<00:02:01.439> seconds<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:01.979> something<00:02:02.219> like

a minute 40 seconds or something like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
a minute 40 seconds or something like
that<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.820> wasn't<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.210> long<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.750> obviously

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that it wasn't very long so obviously

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.920 
that it wasn't very long so obviously
they<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.000> multiple<00:02:06.000> things<00:02:06.479> planned

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
otherwise it wouldn't be a direct it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
otherwise it wouldn't be a direct it
would<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.629> press<00:02:10.349> release<00:02:10.560> or

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
would just be like a press release or

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.059 
would just be like a press release or
something<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.400> that
