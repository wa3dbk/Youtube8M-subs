00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.840 
obviously recognized for fun so and we

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
but let's see what do you think has the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.439 
but let's see what do you think has the
second<00:00:22.410> longest<00:00:22.920> hair<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.269> these

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
second longest hair out of all of these

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.330 
second longest hair out of all of these
princesses<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:27.560> here<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:29.570> Sleeping<00:00:30.570> Beauty

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
princesses and here is Sleeping Beauty

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.270 
princesses and here is Sleeping Beauty
see<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.550> pretty<00:00:32.790> long<00:00:33.090> hair<00:00:34.010> look<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
see that's pretty long hair look at that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
see that's pretty long hair look at that
beautiful<00:00:35.840> long<00:00:36.840> wavy<00:00:37.500> blond<00:00:37.980> hair<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.530> I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
beautiful long wavy blond hair and I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.880 
beautiful long wavy blond hair and I
think<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.989> Ariel<00:00:42.989> went<00:00:43.320> very<00:00:43.590> long

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
think we also have Ariel went very long

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
think we also have Ariel went very long
here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.119 

hmm<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.480> think<00:00:51.480> aerials<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.010> bit

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
hmm I think aerials is just a little bit

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.579 
hmm I think aerials is just a little bit
longer<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> Sleeping<00:00:54.899> Beauty's<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> far<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
longer and Sleeping Beauty's so far it

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.950 
longer and Sleeping Beauty's so far it
seems<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.100> Ariel<00:00:59.640> has<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> second<00:01:00.570> longest

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
seems that Ariel has the second longest

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.399 
seems that Ariel has the second longest
year<00:01:01.640> let's<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:03.140> what<00:01:04.140> about<00:01:04.409> though<00:01:06.409> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
year let's see what about though and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
year let's see what about though and
then<00:01:07.710> probably<00:01:07.979> Elsa<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.640> Belle's<00:01:11.640> hair<00:01:12.119> is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
then probably Elsa so Belle's hair is

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.370 
then probably Elsa so Belle's hair is
also<00:01:13.170> quite<00:01:13.680> long<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.940> let's<00:01:15.240> compare<00:01:15.930> now

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
also quite long and let's compare now

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.889 
also quite long and let's compare now
with<00:01:17.119> Ariel

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.130 

seems<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.740> Bell<00:01:26.040> his<00:01:26.970> hair<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
seems that Bell his hair is just a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.069 
seems that Bell his hair is just a
little<00:01:28.170> bit<00:01:28.470> longer<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.920> time<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:30.149> she's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
little bit longer this time so she's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.480 
little bit longer this time so she's
taking<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> second<00:01:31.950> place<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.399> now<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.560> then

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
taking the second place for now and then

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.919 
taking the second place for now and then
Ariel<00:01:36.000> probably<00:01:40.880> speaking<00:01:41.880> beauty's<00:01:42.420> turning

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
Ariel probably speaking beauty's turning

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.950 
Ariel probably speaking beauty's turning
around<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:44.490> show<00:01:44.729> her<00:01:45.119> beautiful<00:01:45.630> long<00:01:45.899> hair

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
around to show her beautiful long hair

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960 
around to show her beautiful long hair
and<00:01:46.710> so's<00:01:47.369> Ariel<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:49.250> think<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.460> Sleeping

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and so's Ariel I think that Sleeping

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.389 
and so's Ariel I think that Sleeping
Beauty's<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.710> tad<00:01:53.039> longer

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
Beauty's here it's just a tad longer

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
Beauty's here it's just a tad longer
than<00:01:53.759> Ariel's<00:01:54.979> what<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> guys<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:57.530> so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
than Ariel's what do you guys think so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.240 
than Ariel's what do you guys think so
we're<00:01:59.220> gonna<00:01:59.369> put<00:01:59.670> Sleeping<00:02:00.390> Beauty<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.250> third

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
we're gonna put Sleeping Beauty in third

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.840 
we're gonna put Sleeping Beauty in third
place<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:04.439> Ariel<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> fourth<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
place and then Ariel in the fourth and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.370 
place and then Ariel in the fourth and
here<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.200> Elsa<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.700> Ariel<00:02:11.780> now<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:13.019> else

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
here is Elsa and Ariel now I know else

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.080 
here is Elsa and Ariel now I know else
else<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.920> braided<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.730> probably

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
else here is braided so it's probably

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:23.360 
else here is braided so it's probably
much<00:02:15.540> longer<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:17.280> let's<00:02:17.549> check<00:02:17.790> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.650 

I<00:02:24.379> would<00:02:25.379> say<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:26.010> Bell<00:02:26.400> says<00:02:26.700> us<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.239> little

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
I would say that Bell says us a little

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.930 
I would say that Bell says us a little
longer<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.530> unbraided<00:02:29.099> probably<00:02:29.730> much

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
longer and if unbraided probably much

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.690 
longer and if unbraided probably much
longer<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.599> we'll<00:02:31.140> put<00:02:31.349> Elsa<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.510> fourth<00:02:33.510> place

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
longer so we'll put Elsa in fourth place

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.720 
longer so we'll put Elsa in fourth place
and<00:02:35.989> then<00:02:36.989> Ariel<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.670> sixth<00:02:39.269> place

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and then Ariel in sixth place

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.970 
and then Ariel in sixth place
so<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.209> left

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so we have left

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.619 
so we have left
no<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.360> Fionna<00:02:46.340> Cinderella<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.700> uh<00:02:48.060> no<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
no I Fionna Cinderella and uh no and

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.949 
no I Fionna Cinderella and uh no and
it's<00:02:49.379> obvious<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.280> know<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.360> next<00:02:51.750> mom

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
it's obvious that I know as the next mom

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.729 
it's obvious that I know as the next mom
is<00:02:52.110> here<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.360> she<00:02:54.420> would<00:02:54.690> be<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:55.019> sixth

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
is here and so she would be in sixth

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.400 
is here and so she would be in sixth
place<00:02:56.420> then<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.630> would<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.989> snow<00:02:58.739> white<00:03:00.410> with

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
place then it would be snow white with

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.289 
place then it would be snow white with
her<00:03:01.680> cute<00:03:02.640> short<00:03:03.060> hair<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:04.650> would<00:03:04.799> be<00:03:05.010> in

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
her cute short hair and that would be in

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.809 
her cute short hair and that would be in
15<00:03:06.299> seventh<00:03:06.720> place<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:08.299> it's<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.390> tie<00:03:09.629> between

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
15 seventh place now it's a tie between

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.030 
15 seventh place now it's a tie between
Tiana<00:03:11.819> Princess<00:03:12.360> Tiana<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.959> Cinderella<00:03:13.860> as

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
Tiana Princess Tiana and Cinderella as

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.699 
Tiana Princess Tiana and Cinderella as
their<00:03:14.910> hair<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.420> up<00:03:15.660> in<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> bun<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.500> can't

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
their hair is up in a bun so we can't

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.440 
their hair is up in a bun so we can't
really<00:03:16.920> tell<00:03:17.129> how<00:03:17.160> long<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.299> there<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:20.450> but

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
really tell how long then there is but

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.259 
really tell how long then there is but
they're<00:03:21.599> all<00:03:22.079> beautiful<00:03:22.470> nonetheless<00:03:23.269> and

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
they're all beautiful nonetheless and
