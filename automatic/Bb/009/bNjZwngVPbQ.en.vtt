00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.130 
it was the past couple of weeks pain and
preparation<00:00:02.879> was<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.149> guess<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.600> coming<00:00:04.049> into

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
preparation was I guess and coming into

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.900 
preparation was I guess and coming into
this<00:00:04.259> match<00:00:04.520> well<00:00:05.520> we<00:00:05.640> got<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.790> week<00:00:06.029> off<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:07.910> not

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.100 
this match well we got a week off so not
that<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.150> need<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.480> because<00:00:09.570> we've<00:00:09.809> only<00:00:09.929> been

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
that we need it because we've only been

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.259 
that we need it because we've only been
three<00:00:10.320> weeks<00:00:10.349> since<00:00:10.590> their<00:00:10.830> last<00:00:10.980> break<00:00:11.280> but

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
three weeks since their last break but

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.660 
three weeks since their last break but
otherwise<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.380> been<00:00:13.920> good<00:00:14.070> they've<00:00:14.280> worked

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
otherwise it's been good they've worked

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.529 
otherwise it's been good they've worked
pretty<00:00:14.880> hard

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.519 

we'll<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.990> starting<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:24.410> confident<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.500> not

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
we'll be starting off confident but not

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.140 
we'll be starting off confident but not
for<00:00:25.769> too<00:00:25.890> long

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
for too long

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
for too long
okay<00:00:27.150> he's<00:00:27.300> obviously<00:00:28.109> still<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> bit

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
okay he's obviously still a bit

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.490 
okay he's obviously still a bit
underdone<00:00:29.070> match<00:00:29.279> fitness<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.500> he

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
underdone match fitness but but he

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.659 
underdone match fitness but but he
helped<00:00:31.769> us<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:31.980> away<00:00:32.070> though<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.520> good

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
helped us get away though really good

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.660 
helped us get away though really good
start<00:00:32.880> last<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.870> played<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.460> he<00:00:35.460> brings

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
start last time we played and he brings

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.459 
start last time we played and he brings
that<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.570> need<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.870> away<00:00:36.989> well<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that so we need to get away well and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
that so we need to get away well and
hopefully<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> again<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.670> us<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.910> think

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
hopefully can do it again for us I think

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.250 
hopefully can do it again for us I think
he's<00:00:39.210> been<00:00:39.390> might<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.870> made<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> real

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
he's been might have made a real

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.869 
he's been might have made a real
difference<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> we've<00:00:41.160> been<00:00:41.670> doing

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
difference and we and we've been doing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
difference and we and we've been doing
without<00:00:41.969> Danny<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> tremendous

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
without Danny is it there's a tremendous

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
without Danny is it there's a tremendous
asset<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.730> us<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.120> who<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.750> their<00:00:45.899> best<00:00:46.079> player

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
asset to us so who was their best player

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
asset to us so who was their best player
in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> Chris<00:00:46.920> Houston<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.399> until<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.670> got

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
in the Chris Houston up until we got

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
in the Chris Houston up until we got
injured<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.510> hopefully<00:00:49.260> Demi<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.860> back

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
injured there so hopefully Demi be back

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.549 
injured there so hopefully Demi be back
this<00:00:50.190> week<00:00:50.399> as<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.030> Willie<00:00:51.210> there

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
this week as well and was Willie there

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.139 
this week as well and was Willie there
it<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:53.100> might<00:00:53.579> give<00:00:53.760> us<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.059> more

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it just might give us a little more

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
it just might give us a little more
emphasis<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.780> guess<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> results<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> last<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
emphasis I guess the results in last the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
emphasis I guess the results in last the
month<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.090> probably<00:00:57.510> haven't<00:00:57.780> been<00:00:57.840> ideal

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
month also probably haven't been ideal

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.319 
month also probably haven't been ideal
did<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> feel<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
did you feel like there there is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.959 
did you feel like there there is
improvement<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> LA<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.850> there<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
improvement there in LA and there is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
improvement there in LA and there is
direction<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.559> on

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
direction of what you want to see on

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.179 
direction of what you want to see on
there<00:01:04.890> well<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.729> mixed<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> game<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
there well it's mixed but a game where I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
there well it's mixed but a game where I
would<00:01:08.369> doing<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:09.060> stuff<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.330> long

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
would doing some good stuff for long

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
would doing some good stuff for long
periods<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> time<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> full

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
periods of time but not not for the full

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
periods of time but not not for the full
80<00:01:11.490> minutes<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.960> Roosters<00:01:13.350> were

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
80 minutes I think the Roosters were

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
80 minutes I think the Roosters were
eight<00:01:13.950> six<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.939> about<00:01:15.180> 20

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
eight six there well and about 20

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
eight six there well and about 20
minutes<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> go<00:01:15.900> we're<00:01:16.259> pretty<00:01:17.220> close<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
minutes to go we're pretty close out a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
minutes to go we're pretty close out a
night<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.119> long<00:01:18.299> 12<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.810> they're<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.229> about

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
night for long 12 all they're all about

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
night for long 12 all they're all about
20<00:01:19.770> minutes<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.189> again<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
20 minutes to go again so and we just

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.469 
20 minutes to go again so and we just
losing<00:01:22.170> our<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:24.210> there

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
losing our way a little bit so but there

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
losing our way a little bit so but there
has<00:01:24.570> been<00:01:24.600> improving<00:01:25.110> well<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
has been improving well and I can see it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.920 
has been improving well and I can see it
coming<00:01:26.430> together<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.420> there

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.499 

I<00:01:30.930> was<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.579> change<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.210> mean<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
I was just time has change I mean the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.060 
I was just time has change I mean the
for<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:33.930> what's<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> things<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.650> changed

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
for then what's the things have changed

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
for then what's the things have changed
here<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.420> trying<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.750> adapt<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
here so the trying to adapt of the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.310 
here so the trying to adapt of the
change<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:38.130> used<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
change and get used to it and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.650 
change and get used to it and
I<00:01:40.350> guess<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.940> know<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.390> been<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
I guess we you know I think it's been a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.540 
I guess we you know I think it's been a
little<00:01:42.900> bit<00:01:42.990> short<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.350> guess<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.550> attacking

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
then let's look after silver

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.800 
then let's look after silver

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
we'll worry about those things

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.080 
we'll worry about those things

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.490 
you know I said I must win game look
last<00:03:53.330> week<00:03:53.420> was<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> must-win<00:03:54.050> game<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> week

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
last week was a must-win game the week

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.870 
last week was a must-win game the week
before<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.920> must-win<00:03:55.250> game<00:03:55.459> they<00:03:55.610> narrow

before is a must-win game they narrow

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.449 
before is a must-win game they narrow
that<00:03:56.300> down<00:03:56.360> in<00:03:56.720> our<00:03:56.900> game<00:03:57.230> putting<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.280> one's

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
that down in our game putting this one's

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.680 
a must-win game they're all must-win
gaps<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.550> we've<00:04:01.700> lost<00:04:01.880> 6<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.330> 1/4

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
gaps and you know we've lost 6 and 1/4

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.890 
gaps and you know we've lost 6 and 1/4
so<00:04:02.959> that's<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:03.890> way<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.360> then<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.660> start

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
so that's the way it is so then I start

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.570 
so that's the way it is so then I start
for<00:04:06.350> us<00:04:06.410> that<00:04:06.620> we<00:04:06.800> know<00:04:06.950> how<00:04:07.040> important<00:04:07.430> it<00:04:07.520> is

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
for us that we know how important it is

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.910 
for us that we know how important it is
but<00:04:07.790> they've<00:04:07.940> all<00:04:08.060> been<00:04:08.239> important<00:04:08.770> well<00:04:09.770> as<00:04:09.890> I

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
but they've all been important well as I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.910 
but they've all been important well as I
said<00:04:10.220> like<00:04:10.340> forth<00:04:10.760> last<00:04:10.970> week<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:11.480> know<00:04:11.510> we

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
said like forth last week you know we

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.050 
said like forth last week you know we
we're<00:04:12.920> not<00:04:13.069> lacking<00:04:13.250> confidence<00:04:13.580> oh<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:13.970> don't

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
we're not lacking confidence oh I don't

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.760 
we're not lacking confidence oh I don't
think<00:04:14.180> that's<00:04:14.420> that's<00:04:14.780> an<00:04:15.260> issue<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.680> we

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
think that's that's an issue and we

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.140 
think that's that's an issue and we
apply<00:04:15.980> enough<00:04:16.190> good<00:04:16.370> 40<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.700> suggest<00:04:17.030> that's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
apply enough good 40 to suggest that's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.900 
apply enough good 40 to suggest that's
not<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.480> case<00:04:17.690> ok<00:04:18.320> we're<00:04:19.130> just<00:04:19.160> not<00:04:19.430> executing

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
not the case ok we're just not executing

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.759 
not the case ok we're just not executing
well<00:04:20.030> enough<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.570> we're<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:20.780> putting<00:04:21.530> teams

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
well enough and we're not putting teams

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.130 
well enough and we're not putting teams
under<00:04:22.010> enough<00:04:22.220> pressure<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.020> said<00:04:24.020> the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
under enough pressure and said the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.780 
under enough pressure and said the
pressures<00:04:24.620> coming<00:04:24.830> back<00:04:24.919> on<00:04:25.190> us<00:04:25.310> because<00:04:25.490> of

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
pressures coming back on us because of

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.700 
pressures coming back on us because of
errors<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.330> were<00:04:26.540> making<00:04:26.750> or<00:04:27.169> or<00:04:29.710> options

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
errors that were making or or options

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.390

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
like this look that hasn't been one game

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.780

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
which is a really important criteria at

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.130 
which is a really important criteria at
all<00:04:43.700> but<00:04:43.850> we've<00:04:44.150> got<00:04:44.330> executed<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.870> hell<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140
