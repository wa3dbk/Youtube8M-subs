00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.089 

the<00:00:11.219> tale<00:00:11.460> must<00:00:11.969> be<00:00:12.269> Hollow<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> there's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the tale must be Hollow so there's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.129 
the tale must be Hollow so there's
plenty<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> room<00:00:14.670> for<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.389> counterweight<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
plenty of room for the counterweight to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.990 
plenty of room for the counterweight to
swing<00:00:16.500> forward<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.039> back<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:20.490> structure<00:00:20.850> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
swing forward and back this structure is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.170 
swing forward and back this structure is
called<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.630> camelbak<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.730> fits<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.150> top

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
called the camelbak and it fits on top

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.839 
called the camelbak and it fits on top
of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> tail<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:26.130> top<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.519> fuselage<00:00:28.849> layers

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
of the tail or on top of fuselage layers

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.550 
of the tail or on top of fuselage layers
of<00:00:30.119> foam<00:00:30.330> lewd<00:00:30.960> together

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.800 

speed<00:00:37.130> it<00:00:37.250> up<00:00:37.340> here<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> bit

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
speed it up here a bit

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.720 
speed it up here a bit
after<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.590> make<00:00:40.740> the<00:00:40.770> rough<00:00:41.040> touch<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.310> hot

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
after we make the rough touch with hot

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.750 
after we make the rough touch with hot
wire<00:00:41.940> tool<00:00:42.240> will<00:00:42.630> sand<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.230> smooth

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.220 

the<00:00:47.760> reason<00:00:48.060> we<00:00:48.150> have<00:00:48.240> the<00:00:48.330> camelbak<00:00:48.870> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the reason we have the camelbak is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
the reason we have the camelbak is
actually<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.190> we're<00:00:50.370> using<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.760> track<00:00:51.030> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
actually because we're using a track I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.960 
actually because we're using a track I
our<00:00:51.390> system<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.190> infrared<00:00:53.550> tracker

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
our system it's an infrared tracker

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.990 
our system it's an infrared tracker
that's<00:00:54.390> aimed<00:00:54.810> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> helmet<00:00:55.760> but<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.850> need

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that's aimed at the helmet but we need

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's aimed at the helmet but we need
to<00:00:57.150> block<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> light<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.260> coming<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.370> around

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to block the light from coming in around

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.870 
to block the light from coming in around
the<00:01:00.540> pilots<00:01:01.020> ailments<00:01:01.610> that's<00:01:02.610> all<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
the pilots ailments that's all this

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:14.850 
the pilots ailments that's all this
really<00:01:03.030> does<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.630> blocks<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> light<00:01:04.110> from

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.060 

here<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.550> is<00:01:15.640> sanded

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 

and<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.300> see<00:01:21.360> we're<00:01:21.720> experimenting

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and here you can see we're experimenting

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.980 
and here you can see we're experimenting
with<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:23.190> couple<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.610> exhaust<00:01:24.030> pipes<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.690> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
with a couple of exhaust pipes on the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.899 
with a couple of exhaust pipes on the
back<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.470> simulator

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.669 

I<00:01:30.999> was<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> little<00:01:31.869> worried<00:01:32.109> about<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.439> weight

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
I was a little worried about the weight

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.160 
I was a little worried about the weight
of<00:01:33.009> all<00:01:33.399> these<00:01:33.609> different<00:01:34.119> pieces<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.929> maybe

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
of all these different pieces that maybe

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.679 
of all these different pieces that maybe
the<00:01:35.710> added<00:01:36.219> weight<00:01:36.249> would<00:01:36.759> somehow<00:01:37.060> affect

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
the added weight would somehow affect

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.679 
the added weight would somehow affect
the<00:01:37.990> way<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.170> controls<00:01:38.590> feel<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.329> that's<00:01:40.539> not

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
the way the controls feel but that's not

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:57.470 
the way the controls feel but that's not
the<00:01:40.810> case<00:01:41.250> works<00:01:42.250> fine

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.900 

now<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:58.320> shot<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.740> might<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.340> able<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> see

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
now in the shot you might be able to see

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.200 
now in the shot you might be able to see
that<00:02:00.120> we've<00:02:00.270> been<00:02:00.390> using<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.080> foam<00:02:01.380> coat<00:02:01.740> on

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
that we've been using the foam coat on

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.920 
that we've been using the foam coat on
the<00:02:03.210> nose<00:02:04.140> cone<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.010> simulator<00:02:05.930> applying

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the nose cone of the simulator applying

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.220 
the nose cone of the simulator applying
the<00:02:07.170> foam<00:02:07.560> coat<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.340> sanding<00:02:08.760> it<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
the foam coat and then sanding it and

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.230 
the foam coat and then sanding it and
applying<00:02:10.230> it<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.940> trying<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.120> that

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
applying it some more trying to get that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350 
applying it some more trying to get that
nose<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.720> smooth<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.290> possible
