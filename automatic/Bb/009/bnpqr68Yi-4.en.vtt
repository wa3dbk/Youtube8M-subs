 Huge finca in the perfect place for an adult audience 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.070

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:23.409

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:28.189
 we bring a problem we think it's great jack straw and we have cristina 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.269
 10 that never seen before 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.060
 he likes to play any of the people apple tree wants the others 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.490
 land picks up the newspaper every morning 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.300
 it's very funny how they do it seemed to have very good character but in some 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 moment has become very aggressive 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.490
 but 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.700
 can 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.180
 bush the area 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.270
 inns 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.130
 so it is so that it makes its units 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.339
 it is very intimidating oo 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.550
 the other thing is that the first time a month occurs 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.590
 I was very surprised 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.910
 please 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.240
 the government makes a couple of weekends we were sitting outside 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.060
 flexible 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.010
 I return the world 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 It must be said that this is a team and we are sure that they require it 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.540
 when I met him by means of a good bite in the arm 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.500
 worldwide 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 I value it 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.970
 once we started having a grandchild when my husband died about ten years ago 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.070
 years that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 a statement to a motive we have warned people not to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.150
 commit because if you give something every meal to the ground and you take it for sure 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.030
 There are problems 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 martínez we are tense and unhappy because we have an aggressive dog like that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.220
 that we would like an animal to have its house very well if we start 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 see new things 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.030
 on Monday when we started the parties before entering the station and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.520
 after bathing in dry areas with a towel 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.519
 It is a wonderful dog 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.139
 but we have reached a point that if we do not solve this we can have 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.789
 mental problems 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 You can not live with fear, concluded the source 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.489
 all 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.489
 all 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.629
 César Millán expert in canine behavior knows that the first signs of 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.339
 that China with food can derive is an even more dangerous behavior 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.870
 he who can help them 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.140
 oo we have a problem of aggression with the food are Michoacán is still 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.409

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.519
 it had worsened very quickly well I'm going 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.780
 the other one we have a problem but we do not know how to solve the prices we have 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:55.029
 watched many episodes of his program and we have applied his teachings but not 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.839
 we are doing well alive 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:01.699
 it's almost always great to be with him but at times he becomes aggressive if we 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:05.549
 terrifies that we have visits with young children lombo that someone 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.169
 give something to eat and death three years ago the situations that cause 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.219
 a dog becomes aggressive 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.920
 some to a red zone like I call it 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.989
 henson the domain the territorial behavior the fear forgiveness but the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.000
 anxiety those things finder a dog that has already bitten a human being has to 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
 come to the center of the country as to what it is like if we take it to 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.560
 the angels chillán so that the morning teaches him to be submissive while 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 eat it seems fine esteller álvarez inta we would do it if not 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.539
 let's make it beat 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.799
 peaks of tohá who think they are from the herd with other breeds and dogs of their 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.409
 own race in its extinction 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.430
 I would learn to be sociable before this year if she is happy they are prepared 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.760
 so that we begin we advocate task to challenge it first alone and without you and 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.300
 castle because if they get nervous and tense Saul gives him more strength 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.059
 of them want 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.590
 I'm not going to get nervous and tense 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.740
 I'm going to be like a parachute rooster I'm going to throw and I'm going to have fun 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.809
 I'm not afraid of frieden 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.099
 how aggression for food is antisocial behavior 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.969
 Caesar presents cricket to some members of his pack to observe his 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.859
 Sociability together with other dogs 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.340
 arts has already begun to work with the healing herd I have here to heal 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.919
 sumatra and added 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.259
 they have helped me and kept it at a distance from ore flowers only 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.770
 have had a full social distance so if you have common sense that 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.020
 nobody has said anything to him but he is being aggressive alves and that's not 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.020
 it has nothing to do with common sense 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.669
 although from a distance 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.249
 will be before that is good this is your home this your territory but when they have 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.249
 entered these guys have placed him in a post of followers 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 well, well 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.210
 I go to a stick 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:19.000
 4 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.740
 I want to visit understood perfectly that I was not going to leave the food 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.699
 Caracas 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.830
 lakes was also there to intimidate them and not to claim their 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.280
 family 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.580
 Clear 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.809
 now 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:34.809
 Please please 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.969
 please 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.139
 in these moments there is a radical transformation not in the second 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 he realized that they have to surrender to me 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.990
 yes it is not insecure and that is what I have taken advantage of for you I have not left 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.040
 influence why he points me I felt jealous and desire that is huge 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.589
 concentration for 15 cents per serving state insisting 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.719
 yes and you have realized the purpose that yes you can is your weakness 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.809
 but as he has done, I have simply thrown myself off the plane 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.770
 if it is efficient French habitats solved the amazing problem and 

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:15.749
 quickly 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.019
 as evidence that we can do the michelle style standing invitation 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.549
 so that he comes with us and the herd so that he learns how he treats 

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.779
 dogs to humans 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:28.779
 the biggest ones is that they have already seen how he has quickly turned away from my dogs 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.189
 end do not know how to pull with humans does not know how to be with you but 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.150
 he knows how to be with the dogs 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.539
 the logical thing is that working with your pack has many meanings 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.919
 in this way this family needs outside help 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.580
 Although this is a case that can not be rehabilitated at home by the family 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.479
 marley benito to me do not have the necessary knowledge ochoa for 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.479
 deal with an aggressive dogs or 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.900
 we are very relieved by the fact that I will be out a couple of 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.560
 weeks 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.000
 it gives us a break to calm down, it will improve us 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.479
 we also live and when I return it will be like starting over 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.520
 3 I'm a little sad but I know it's the best thing yes yes if Caesar thinks that 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.599
 have to leave 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.089
 You better go 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:18.079
 very goodbye thank you there were arias guys and thanks is a great dog 

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.129
 whole month we made some mistakes and now we have the opportunity 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:23.319
 of learning 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.319
 percent 

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.009
 t 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.009
 3 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.659
 cc oo 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.889
 I think I got home one week and a half ago that cricket is with 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.669
 us so we were from here so that we remove that rage that suffers 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:44.790
 when he is eating 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.450
 according to him of divided his food in three sallent nations and thus I can challenge him 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.210
 three times a day
