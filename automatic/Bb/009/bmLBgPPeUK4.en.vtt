00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the feel that previous SI models have

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
the feel that previous SI models have
had<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> solve<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.090> issue<00:00:45.270> honda<00:00:45.930> has

car enthusiasts have been asking for the

car enthusiasts have been asking for the
Michelin's<00:03:00.370> bite<00:03:00.670> much<00:03:00.940> harder<00:03:01.329> in<00:03:01.450> the

Michelin's bite much harder in the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.289 
Michelin's bite much harder in the
corners<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.139> while<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> SI<00:03:03.160> itself<00:03:03.819> actually

corners and while the SI itself actually

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.940 
corners and while the SI itself actually
does<00:03:04.420> set<00:03:04.900> nicely<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.319> corners<00:03:05.590> there's<00:03:05.769> too

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
does set nicely in corners there's too

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.339 
does set nicely in corners there's too
much<00:03:06.130> body<00:03:06.459> roll<00:03:06.609> this<00:03:07.269> car<00:03:07.599> however<00:03:07.780> there's

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
much body roll this car however there's

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.410 
much body roll this car however there's
a<00:03:08.440> lot<00:03:08.769> less<00:03:08.980> body<00:03:09.250> roll<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.639> bites<00:03:10.000> earlier

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
a lot less body roll it bites earlier

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.210 
a lot less body roll it bites earlier
and<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.690> gives<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.930> way<00:03:11.380> more<00:03:11.709> confidence

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and it gives you way more confidence

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.449 
and it gives you way more confidence
behind<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.549> wheel<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.769> confidence

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
behind the wheel and that confidence

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.009 
behind the wheel and that confidence
helps<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.880> really<00:03:16.150> exploit<00:03:16.660> one<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
helps you really exploit one of the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.050 
helps you really exploit one of the
Civic's<00:03:17.349> best<00:03:17.829> attributes<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.730> that's<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
Civic's best attributes and that's the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.370 
Civic's best attributes and that's the
fact<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.359> despite<00:03:19.540> being<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.989> front-wheel

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
fact that despite being a front-wheel

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.530 
fact that despite being a front-wheel
drive<00:03:20.410> car<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:21.099> really<00:03:21.489> behaves<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.970> lot<00:03:22.209> like<00:03:22.269> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
drive car it really behaves a lot like a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.300 
drive car it really behaves a lot like a
rear-wheel<00:03:23.049> drive<00:03:23.079> car<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.919> can<00:03:24.069> really

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
rear-wheel drive car and you can really

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.159 
rear-wheel drive car and you can really
toss<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.120> corners<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.510> kind<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.750> drive

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
toss it in the corners and kind of drive

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.930 
toss it in the corners and kind of drive
it<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.470> rear<00:03:26.620> pitching<00:03:27.099> it<00:03:27.190> around<00:03:27.430> and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
it with the rear pitching it around and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.520 
it with the rear pitching it around and
really<00:03:28.359> get<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> most<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.109> you<00:03:29.380> can

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
really get the most out of it you can

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.680 
really get the most out of it you can
scrub<00:03:29.889> off<00:03:30.069> speed<00:03:30.489> by<00:03:30.700> dragging<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.359> rear<00:03:31.540> as

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
scrub off speed by dragging the rear as

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.000 
scrub off speed by dragging the rear as
opposed<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.139> using<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.470> brakes<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.919> its

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
opposed to using the brakes and its

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.890 
opposed to using the brakes and its
really<00:03:33.459> handy<00:03:33.849> for<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.090> especially<00:03:34.569> here<00:03:34.750> on

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
really handy for that especially here on

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.770 
really handy for that especially here on
an<00:03:35.019> autocross<00:03:35.500> track<00:03:36.090> there<00:03:37.090> are<00:03:37.299> no<00:03:37.510> changes

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
to what's under the hood it's still a

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.270

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
I would ask that Honda add a little bit

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
more potent to that powerplant

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.520 
more potent to that powerplant
