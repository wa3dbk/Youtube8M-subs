circles<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.960> opposed<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> an<00:01:01.949> oval<00:01:02.430> shape<00:01:02.699> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
circles as opposed to an oval shape that

many belly dance tops have and the round

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.200 
many belly dance tops have and the round
cups<00:01:06.299> create<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> gap<00:01:07.470> between<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.250> cups<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
cups create a gap between the cups so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.750 
cups create a gap between the cups so
draw<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> shape<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.560> want<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> once<00:01:11.549> that's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
draw that shape you want and once that's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.899 
draw that shape you want and once that's
done<00:01:12.060> cut<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> why<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> need

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
done cut it out and this is why you need

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
done cut it out and this is why you need
a<00:01:14.939> full<00:01:15.240> coverage<00:01:15.630> bra<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a full coverage bra because we will be

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
a full coverage bra because we will be
cutting<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> bra<00:01:18.000> cups<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
cutting the bra cups which i think is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
cutting the bra cups which i think is
easier<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.250> adding<00:01:20.610> coverage<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.110> smaller

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
easier than adding coverage to smaller

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:33.130 
easier than adding coverage to smaller
cups

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140 

so<00:01:34.140> initially<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> wanted<00:01:34.980> to<00:01:35.250> save<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.880> wires

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
so initially I wanted to save the wires

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330 
so initially I wanted to save the wires
for<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.660> better<00:01:36.840> support<00:01:37.440> but<00:01:37.980> I<00:01:38.010> quickly

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
for a better support but I quickly

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850 
for a better support but I quickly
realize<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> big<00:01:39.450> mistake<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.620> wires

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
realize it's a big mistake the wires

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
realize it's a big mistake the wires
sticking<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.550> prevents<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.470> creating

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sticking out prevents you from creating

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.830 
sticking out prevents you from creating
the<00:01:43.590> gap<00:01:43.830> between<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.370> cups<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.450> keep

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the gap between the cups you can keep

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710 
the gap between the cups you can keep
them<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.260> hide<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:47.280> fabric<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
them and hide them with fabric that you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.200 
them and hide them with fabric that you
will<00:01:48.960> cover<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.500> bra<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:50.010> but<00:01:50.580> depending<00:01:51.060> on

will cover the bra with but depending on

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.540 
will cover the bra with but depending on
the<00:01:51.330> design<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.990> may<00:01:52.320> compromise<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.010> D<00:01:53.340> nut

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
the design it may compromise the D nut

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.290 
the design it may compromise the D nut

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.100 

okay<00:02:31.340> now<00:02:31.640> let's<00:02:31.970> make<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.239> base<00:02:32.510> for<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> bra

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
okay now let's make a base for the bra

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.289 
okay now let's make a base for the bra
cups<00:02:33.409> to<00:02:33.590> be<00:02:33.709> sewn<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.310> another

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
the interfacing the interfacing I use

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.430 
the interfacing the interfacing I use
work<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:01.069> experiment<00:03:01.819> but<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.959> very

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
work for this experiment but it is very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.470 
work for this experiment but it is very
thin<00:03:03.859> for<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.340> type<00:03:04.549> of<00:03:04.579> project<00:03:04.940> I

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
thin for this type of project I

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.619 
thin for this type of project I
recommend<00:03:06.290> using<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.799> thicker<00:03:07.040> type<00:03:07.400> or<00:03:07.670> so<00:03:08.599> a

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
recommend using a thicker type or so a

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.440 
recommend using a thicker type or so a
piece<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.440> felts<00:03:10.099> cut<00:03:10.430> into<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.819> same<00:03:11.090> size

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
piece of felts cut into the same size

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.530 
piece of felts cut into the same size
onto<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> interfacing<00:03:13.129> so<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.849> gives<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.299> nice

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
onto the interfacing so it gives a nice

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.860

isold interfacing along the curves of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.839 
isold interfacing along the curves of
the<00:03:34.310> cups<00:03:35.169> after<00:03:36.169> that<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.620> drew<00:03:37.099> lines<00:03:37.430> that

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
the cups after that I drew lines that

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.479 
the cups after that I drew lines that
extend<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.510> nicely<00:03:39.049> down<00:03:39.290> from<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.889> cups<00:03:40.190> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
extend it nicely down from the cups and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.629 
extend it nicely down from the cups and
created<00:03:41.450> sharp<00:03:41.930> corners<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.829> emphasize<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
created sharp corners to emphasize the

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.509 
created sharp corners to emphasize the
Dena<00:03:43.910> design<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.870> cut<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.829> section<00:03:46.069> and

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
Dena design and cut out the section and

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.089 
Dena design and cut out the section and
also<00:03:46.910> cut<00:03:47.299> out<00:03:47.329> excess<00:03:47.840> fabric<00:03:48.139> inside<00:03:48.829> of<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
also cut out excess fabric inside of the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.339 
also cut out excess fabric inside of the

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.930 

next<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.470> created<00:03:54.859> side<00:03:55.280> straps<00:03:55.669> with

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
next I created side straps with

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.420 
next I created side straps with
interfacing<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.440> make<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.799> straps<00:03:58.160> I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
interfacing to make the straps I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.640 
interfacing to make the straps I
basically<00:03:59.120> took<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.690> measurement<00:04:00.139> from<00:04:00.590> the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
basically took a measurement from the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.240 
basically took a measurement from the
end<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.370> bra<00:04:01.609> cup<00:04:01.880> around<00:04:02.269> my<00:04:02.930> back<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:04.010> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
end of a bra cup around my back to the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.550 
end of a bra cup around my back to the
end<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:04.849> other<00:04:05.000> cup<00:04:05.299> divide<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
end of the other cup divide the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.580 
end of the other cup divide the
measurement<00:04:07.040> by<00:04:07.370> two<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.150> give<00:04:09.019> about<00:04:09.319> 5

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
measurement by two and give about 5

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.860 
measurement by two and give about 5
centimeters<00:04:10.250> for<00:04:10.549> overlapping<00:04:11.180> section

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
centimeters for overlapping section

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.229 
centimeters for overlapping section
where<00:04:12.139> you<00:04:12.440> would<00:04:12.620> attach<00:04:12.980> hooks<00:04:13.489> in<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.879> snap

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
where you would attach hooks in a snap

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.839 
where you would attach hooks in a snap
button<00:04:14.660> add<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:15.410> couple<00:04:15.769> of<00:04:15.889> centimeters<00:04:16.280> for

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
button add a couple of centimeters for

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.610 
button add a couple of centimeters for
seam<00:04:17.090> allowance<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:18.019> section<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.560> is

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
seam allowance to the section that is

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.430 
seam allowance to the section that is
attached<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.639> bra<00:04:19.910> base<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.479> this<00:04:21.169> should

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
attached to the bra base and this should

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.000 
attached to the bra base and this should
be<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.799> length<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.310> one<00:04:22.880> side<00:04:23.240> strap<00:04:23.930> again<00:04:24.470> I

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
be the length of one side strap again I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.339 
be the length of one side strap again I
would<00:04:25.250> add<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.789> piece<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.419> felt<00:04:26.690> onto<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
would add a piece of felt onto the

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.500 
would add a piece of felt onto the
interfacing<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.430> strengthen<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.270> side

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
interfacing to strengthen the side

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.200 
interfacing to strengthen the side
straps<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.770> just<00:04:31.010> pin<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> side<00:04:31.580> straps<00:04:31.880> onto

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
straps so just pin the side straps onto

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:50.210 
straps so just pin the side straps onto
the<00:04:32.510> cups<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.020> sew<00:04:33.380> them<00:04:33.560> together

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.580 

and<00:04:51.390> now<00:04:52.390> cover<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.050> whole<00:04:53.260> thing<00:04:53.290> with

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
and now cover the whole thing with

of<00:04:58.870> seams<00:04:59.230> so<00:05:00.010> first<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.550> cut<00:05:00.760> out<00:05:00.820> the<00:05:01.180> fabric

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
of seams so first I cut out the fabric

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.870 
of seams so first I cut out the fabric
large<00:05:02.080> enough<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.620> cover<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.310> whole<00:05:03.550> thing

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
large enough to cover the whole thing

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.950 
large enough to cover the whole thing
here<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.720> used<00:05:05.260> light<00:05:05.710> blue<00:05:06.390> non-stretch<00:05:07.390> satin

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960

00:05:07.960 --> 00:06:07.409 
here I used light blue non-stretch satin
fabric<00:05:08.230> pin<00:05:09.220> into<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.580> bra<00:05:09.910> from<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.420> center

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.200 

now<00:06:08.419> feel<00:06:08.720> free<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:09.229> cut<00:06:09.470> excess<00:06:09.949> fabric<00:06:10.250> also

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
now feel free to cut excess fabric also

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.080 
now feel free to cut excess fabric also
it<00:06:11.389> helps<00:06:11.750> to<00:06:11.930> add<00:06:12.110> a<00:06:12.500> few<00:06:13.010> small<00:06:13.400> slits<00:06:13.790> where

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
it helps to add a few small slits where

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.360 
it helps to add a few small slits where
the<00:06:14.270> line<00:06:14.510> curves<00:06:14.990> for<00:06:15.320> example<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:16.010> center

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
the line curves for example the center

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.219 
the line curves for example the center
of<00:06:16.490> the<00:06:16.639> brush<00:06:16.820> should<00:06:17.090> be<00:06:17.210> cut<00:06:17.450> like<00:06:17.690> this<00:06:17.960> to

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
of the brush should be cut like this to

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.370 
of the brush should be cut like this to
accommodate<00:06:18.770> the<00:06:18.919> sharp<00:06:19.220> corners<00:06:19.820> and<00:06:20.350> make<00:06:21.350> a

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
accommodate the sharp corners and make a

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.800 
accommodate the sharp corners and make a
fold<00:06:21.740> at<00:06:22.010> the<00:06:22.070> bottom<00:06:22.580> of<00:06:22.729> each<00:06:23.090> cup<00:06:23.450> to<00:06:23.630> create

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
fold at the bottom of each cup to create

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.350 
fold at the bottom of each cup to create
a<00:06:24.020> nice<00:06:24.350> curve<00:06:24.800> if<00:06:25.070> you<00:06:25.550> use<00:06:25.729> stretch<00:06:26.150> material

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
a nice curve if you use stretch material

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.740 
a nice curve if you use stretch material
or<00:06:27.050> flatter<00:06:27.500> cups<00:06:27.919> you<00:06:28.460> may<00:06:28.639> not<00:06:28.820> have<00:06:29.090> to<00:06:29.419> make

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
or flatter cups you may not have to make

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.460 
or flatter cups you may not have to make
