00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.849
 how 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.820
 good 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.010
 with more bad field and they know what day I am 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 Thursday but that has nothing to do 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.280
 because today we have another video of 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.449
 bad field questions for this series 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.160
 who do not know in which you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.230
 using the hashtag questions but bill 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 down in the comments section can 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 leave me your question referred to what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.519
 be with respect to the saga of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 butterfield that included also 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.960
 questions of bad filipe and ibarra gta 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 ba running for speed or whatever you want 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.579
 say but good starting with the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.760
 first question of today that says 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 so nicolÃ¡s sariego what do you think of that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.239
 there are no global weapons ie weapons 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
 for all teams and all 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 classes like the carbines in butterfield 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 4 well although there are weapons for all 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.649
 equipment let's say the only thing that there is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 to do is unlock them for both 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 sides the issue of no weapons 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 global as the carbines in those of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.640
 phil 4 or pistols for all classes 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 maybe not all guns an idea 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.760
 what had happened to me was to have 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.769
 the carbines which at this moment 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 they are practically useless in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
 comparison to the assault rifles for the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 class of the operator or the doctor 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 and besides holding the guns 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.250
 also from the doctor who are the guns 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 of 9 millimeters are the most bases 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 let's say they are not even good at short 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 distances or good to long distances 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.259
 they are so very standard to have those two 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.659
 categories of weapons for all 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.819
 classes then with that we can add 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 a little more variety to the game more than 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.859
 not so specialized and let's say how 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 closed centered to each of the 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.429
 classes in what you have to do but 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.859
 that we add a little more variety to 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.469
 each one of them and more possibilities not 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.689
 have a class like derrick or not in 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.179
 this case the professional specialist 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.700
 but with a carbine running around 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.319
 over there having the class also of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.759
 mechanical not only with weapons 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.619
 personal defense but with a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.270
 carbine which is always like a 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.310
 rifle assault but a little worse in 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.959
 practically every situation that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 it's something that I 'd like to see a lot that 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:03.090
 appear in the game let's say do not think 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.759
 that will happen in no time 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.409
 but the truth is that it's something that I do not 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.060
 I've never liked it since I 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370
 I heard above the guns of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.780
 the carbines can live for it but 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.579
 the issue of the guns that we have 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.210
 different types of guns are very 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.920
 different 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.180
 each of the classes as the subject of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.010
 the revolvers for example to me the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.360
 revolvers I do not like just is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.460
 a category of weapons that I do not like 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.810
 but I'm obligated to use them with the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.210
 mechanic class unless you want 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.760
 use I do not know the taser which also does not 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.920
 convinces too much as I already tell you such 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.330
 not all weapons categories 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.680
 for all classes but even if they are 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 the carbines and the pistols 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.620
 9 mm semi-automatic 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.200
 question number 2 and I have every 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.970
 asks the big show says ibex what 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.680
 you think of the team deathmatch or auto mode 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.349
 hired by teams at harley and is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.970
 true that bites greetings very well there 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.530
 many things that say about me that they are 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.569
 certain and many that do not so I'm going to 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.910
 leave that there so that each of 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.470
 you decide but I think the way 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.290
 from all to all by teams in 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.239
 harlem the truth is that that day in the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.849
 which were for the subject of the responsos 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.950
 because I think I read I'm not 100% 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.049
 sure it was like they thought about 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.670
 a new idea to do the responsos 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.099
 one of the developers I think that 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.610
 He said that to vary or to do it 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.500
 different and that just did not work 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.680
 now I think it did not occur to them 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.940
 test this during all times and 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.860
 I think you've already said in other videos 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.500
 other times they invite people of rum q 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.310
 during a beta an alpha to test the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.360
 idea that if we put respawn 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.640
 completely random around the 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.430
 map in a two-team game was going to 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.590
 arm a horrible chaos like this and already 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.600
 we know how the people of the community 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 react against these with these 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.830
 situations 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.450
 not only response he answers us 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.820
 what is all treated by teams but 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.800
 also in what is conquest lengthened 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.480
 conquest in general the responsos 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.520
 very bad around the band are 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.710
 completely random while 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.420
 more random theme of gas in a game 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.030
 in my opinion worse it becomes in 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.310
 practically any sense is taken out 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.080
 it removes all kinds of skill that is 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.210
 can get to have different 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.820
 situations and the only thing that is added is 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.590
 luck the one that has more luck is going to 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.060
 go better and this is the one that has more 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.220
 luck today in all contracts for 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.170
 teams in harlem is the best 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.420
 to go because it is the one that more times goes to 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.490
 respond with enemies that are giving 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.230
 the back and with fewer enemies than you 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.840
 come out do not revive them from behind and what 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.880
 Kill the truth on the back of the head 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.670
 is that they always add something like that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.320
 of luck added in a game no or in 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.210
 whatever it is in any kind aspect I 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.100
 It seems like a bad idea about everything 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.530
 when we talk about the kind of a game that 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.450
 is to simply kill in an area 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 concentrated of enemies and you start to 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.300
 get them to make enemies for everyone 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.980
 sides I do not know why I just do not 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.720
 they copied the idea of bad filtres that my 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.460
 opinion was the best in which a 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.100
 team responds from one side to the other 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.630
 once one of the two teams is 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.380
 start to put in the team's base 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.690
 enemy 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.400
 those response are turned and so 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.169
 we are all happy we do not have people 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.759
 that is reviving us in the back and 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.080
 we laugh on the back of 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.300
 our enemies not a way either 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.389
 completely unfair 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.639
 and question number three of me do not fit 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.250
 that says how long you think they're going 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.690
 to take out a DLCI and think that you are going to 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.909
 be good to us and they will give us 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.669
 a nice pack of maps and weapons well here 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.680
 I do not know if you mixed the companies and 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.509
 did you mean visceral instead of dais or 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.810
 you're talking first about pacifying 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.610
 and after butterfield 4 but if okay 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.770
 I do not know how long they will take a day 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.169
 lc it seems to me that they are going to have to 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.050
 have enough in mind for the 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.699
 longevity of the game currently for 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.800
 bate felix jalan in what kind there is 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.020
 very but very few people there are less people 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.060
 in tax bases that in butterfield 4 and 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.470
 I think he 's in banfield 3 playing in 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.690
 pc and I also think that in what is 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.160
 and consoles of the old generation do not 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.230
 now what is new consoles 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.510
 generation there is a lot but a lot 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.760
 more people I think that one of the issues with 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.410
 respect has to be seen because in 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.520
 playstation 4 mostly there has not been 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.200
 good shooters that have come out 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.760
 lately to the market then it's like 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.380
 that everyone simply does not 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.129
 is another option to play butterfield 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.229
 garland 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.059
 although as I say I do not know if they are going to 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.499
 when they are going to draw a dlc it seems to me that 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:14.959
 they are going to have to keep it in mind 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:16.429
 how they scatter those times and how many 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.050
 they're going to end up taking out they said they're going to 

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:20.479
 have 4 maybe they will end up doing 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.580
 more or give us weapon packs and maps like 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.050
 you say to extend a bit the 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.969
 longevity of the game because as 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.559
 I'm seeing for now I do not think I'm going 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.709
 to last a lot if you do not make good ones 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:32.719
 changes or a good let's say added from 

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:36.289
 what is content to the game even if 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.610
 I started or on the old consoles but 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.139
 well those are all the questions that 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.610
 I have to answer for today 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.559
 do not forget to leave yours for 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.879
 please if you want to keep this series 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.529
 live down in the comments section 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.719
 hashtags waterfield questions can 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.699
 ask what they want referred to the 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.080
 saga of booty in general what is 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.550
 ruling the best ones for a video 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.559
 in two weeks and I'll be 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.330
 answering but as always I hope that 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.110
 you liked this video we see the 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.110
