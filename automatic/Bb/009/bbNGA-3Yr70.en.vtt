but<00:01:05.000> he's<00:01:05.120> incredibly<00:01:05.690> slow<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.979> I<00:01:07.250> have<00:01:07.430> to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
but he's incredibly slow so I have to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.770 
but he's incredibly slow so I have to
stop<00:01:07.850> off<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.180> just<00:01:08.330> stop<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.630> get<00:01:08.720> some

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.460 
drinks and whatnot at this settlement
yeah<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:13.700> he's<00:01:13.820> always<00:01:14.330> about<00:01:14.690> five<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.229> six

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
yeah but he's always about five to six

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.440 
yeah but he's always about five to six
minutes<00:01:15.710> behind<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:16.670> keep<00:01:16.850> having<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.150> stop

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
minutes behind so I keep having to stop

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.149 
minutes behind so I keep having to stop
anyway<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:19.100> alive

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:33.460 

once<00:01:25.159> again<00:01:25.340> find<00:01:25.820> myself<00:01:26.000> waiting<00:01:26.600> for<00:01:32.470> very

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
once again find myself waiting for very

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.400 
once again find myself waiting for very
very<00:01:33.920> far<00:01:34.190> behind

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
very far behind

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.840 
very far behind
I'm<00:01:36.410> not<00:01:36.590> even<00:01:36.830> going<00:01:36.979> at<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.190> quick<00:01:37.399> pace<00:01:37.430> but

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I'm not even going at a quick pace but

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.020 
I'm not even going at a quick pace but
then<00:01:37.940> again<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.360> doesn't<00:01:38.539> matter<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.850> is

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
then again it doesn't matter this is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.740 
then again it doesn't matter this is
going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.360> be<00:01:41.450> quite<00:01:41.690> an<00:01:41.840> adventure<00:01:41.960> raising<00:01:43.270> a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.249 

couple<00:01:47.750> hours<00:01:48.020> into<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.380> cycle<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:50.259> reckon

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
couple hours into the cycle and reckon

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.710 
couple hours into the cycle and reckon
it<00:01:51.350> should<00:01:51.560> take<00:01:51.740> six<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.039> eight<00:01:52.130> hours<00:01:52.720> so

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
it should take six to eight hours so

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.169 
it should take six to eight hours so
I'll<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.229> checking<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.679> well<00:01:55.340> admittedly<00:01:55.820> were

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
I'll be checking it well admittedly were

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.020 
I'll be checking it well admittedly were
