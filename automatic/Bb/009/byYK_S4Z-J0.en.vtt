seven hundred rpm when it's the first

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.530 
seven hundred rpm when it's the first
time<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.460> start<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.850> vehicle<00:01:26.210> today<00:01:26.390> it's

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
quite cold morning so the RPM is at

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.580 
quite cold morning so the RPM is at
about<00:01:29.240> eleven<00:01:29.689> hundred<00:01:29.720> right<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:30.290> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.580 

you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.310> see<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.689> rents<00:01:36.960> fluctuating

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
you can see that the rents fluctuating

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.410 
you can see that the rents fluctuating
when<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> crash<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> floor<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
when I crash the floor so there it is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.389 
when I crash the floor so there it is
that's<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.110> stop<00:01:40.560> start<00:01:40.770> engine<00:01:41.189> for

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
that's just the stop start engine for

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.929 
that's just the stop start engine for
the<00:01:41.490> BMW<00:01:42.229> e90<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> same<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the BMW e90 it will be the same for the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.649 
the BMW e90 it will be the same for the
a<00:01:44.970> 91<00:01:45.509> 92<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> 93<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:47.369> also<00:01:47.909> assume<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.509> going

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
a 91 92 and 93 I also assume it's going

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.100 
a 91 92 and 93 I also assume it's going
to<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> same<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.380> AE<00:01:49.970> ad<00:01:50.970> series<00:01:51.479> so

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to be the same for the AE ad series so

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.529 
to be the same for the AE ad series so
the<00:01:52.229> e<00:01:52.549> we<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> Zed<00:01:53.939> 4<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.330> then<00:01:54.420> you've

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
the e we got the Zed 4 and then you've

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.020 
the e we got the Zed 4 and then you've
got<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> 1<00:01:54.929> series<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.500> well<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
got the 1 series as well I think it's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.080 
got the 1 series as well I think it's
something<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.360> 81<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.369> 87-88<00:01:59.369> something

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
something like 81 it to 87-88 something

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.859 
something like 81 it to 87-88 something
