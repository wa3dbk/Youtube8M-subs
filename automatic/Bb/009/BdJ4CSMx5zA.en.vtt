00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.620
 day more than such you are today and good here 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 I bring you a new one because analysis and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 this time this pokemon with me with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.879
 this planted type pokemon has the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.420
 joke skills breakthrough and the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 occult skill chlorophyll joker what 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.540
 what it does is that it allows you to always use 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.970
 before the state attacks an example 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.230
 it would be a good thing 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.989
 trespassing what it does is that 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.830
 example cancels the opponent's moves 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.060
 if you use fog light screen and all 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.149
 these attack this state 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.850
 and chlorophyll what it does is that if there 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.850
 sunny day will increase our speed 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.360
 the best attacks that we can put 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.630
 to this pokemon would be giga paralyzer 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.580
 of fill or solar ray of winners and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 substitute and also if you want him 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.390
 We can put mockery by looking at the end and strength 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.790
 lunar 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 the two best natures that you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.320
 we can put this pokemon would be the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.170
 scary nature to increase the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.750
 speed or we can also put the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.590
 modest nature to increase the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.590
 special attack 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.840
 this pokemon is going very well especially for 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:06.679
 the double fights and we can choose to 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.129
 a companion like a lion that would go 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.800
 also quite well thank you luismi 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.590
 cot is a pokÃ©mon 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.989
 pretty fast and if we put the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.209
 joker skill all attacks 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.040
 this state for example with paralyzer 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.040
 will always attack the first 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.360
 then we will substitute him because 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.850
 it's also a state attack and how 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.450
 organist will always attack huixmi with the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.450
 First 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.890
 of object I would put the object 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.099
 equipped remains because while we 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.630
 we protect with substitute so we go 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.630
 recovering bs 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.310
 how 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.310
 ah 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.290
 and another movement that also has to 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.560
 have this pokemon would be drained hours 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.790
 while we use substitute and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.220
 we paralyzed our rival because 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.240
 we launch winners and so we are also going 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:55.120
 recovering little by little ps and so the 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.120
 rival will be losing ps little by little 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.000
 and then we will put the movement 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.580
 won that this movement what does 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 is that apart from hurting we also 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.750
 will recover ps and if you prefer it then you 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.109
 you can put sunray and put a 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.769
 a companion pokemon that has learned 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.769
 sunny day 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.259
 and well, that's all I hope you 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.719
 this little analysis has helped 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.639

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.300
