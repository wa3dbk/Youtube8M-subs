vaguely<00:02:15.959> aware<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.769> had<00:02:16.860> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
vaguely aware of but then you had to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.220 
vaguely aware of but then you had to
look<00:02:17.070> into<00:02:17.400> another<00:02:17.700> book<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.989> it's<00:02:19.140> an

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
look into another book and now it's an
