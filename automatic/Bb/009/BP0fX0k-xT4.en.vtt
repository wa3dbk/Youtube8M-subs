00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
analysis and you have to be correct I'd

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.780 
analysis and you have to be correct I'd
recommend<00:02:11.709> for<00:02:11.739> example<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.430> even<00:02:12.610> keep

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
recommend for example that you even keep

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
recommend for example that you even keep
some<00:02:13.000> stats<00:02:13.269> on<00:02:13.620> yourself<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.860> how<00:02:15.760> often<00:02:16.030> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
some stats on yourself on how often you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.780 
some stats on yourself on how often you
say<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.709> you're<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.190> out<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.640> how

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
say that you're going to get out and how

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.610 
say that you're going to get out and how
often<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:19.780> actually<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.500> because

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
often that you actually do it because

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
often that you actually do it because
that's<00:02:20.859> important<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.639> you<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.389> find<00:02:22.660> that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
that's important and you will find that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
that's important and you will find that
as<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.200> improve<00:02:23.530> your<00:02:23.709> percentages<00:02:24.310> of

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
as you improve your percentages of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.840 
as you improve your percentages of
running

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
running

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.760 
running
out<00:02:24.970> obviously<00:02:25.810> you'll<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.230> improving<00:02:26.620> your

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
out obviously you'll be improving your

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.580 
out obviously you'll be improving your
results<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.750> have<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.380> able<00:02:29.470> to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
results so you have to be able to

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.650 
results so you have to be able to
analyze<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> table<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:31.270> of<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> greatest

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
analyze a table one of the greatest

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.480 
analyze a table one of the greatest
players<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.320> ever<00:02:32.500> knew<00:02:32.740> his<00:02:33.010> name's<00:02:33.310> Larry

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
players I ever knew his name's Larry

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.080 
players I ever knew his name's Larry

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.060 
Hobart
he<00:02:34.420> always<00:02:34.660> said<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:35.410> he's<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:35.830> right

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
he always said and I think he's so right

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.670 
he always said and I think he's so right
that<00:02:36.340> 8-ball<00:02:36.910> unlike<00:02:37.540> nine<00:02:37.840> ball<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.530> little

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
that 8-ball unlike nine ball is a little

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.130 
that 8-ball unlike nine ball is a little
like<00:02:39.040> poker<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:40.570> dealt<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.960> hand

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
like poker because you get dealt a hand

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.720 
like poker because you get dealt a hand
and<00:02:41.350> your<00:02:41.470> opponent<00:02:41.830> gets<00:02:41.950> dealt<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.310> hand<00:02:42.460> and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and your opponent gets dealt a hand and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
and your opponent gets dealt a hand and
keep<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.570> mind<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.410> hand<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.040> you're

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
keep in mind that the hand that you're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.160 
keep in mind that the hand that you're
dealt<00:02:45.220> could<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.790> more<00:02:46.000> difficult<00:02:46.120> than<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
dealt could be more difficult than the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.230 
dealt could be more difficult than the
hand<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.590> opponent's<00:02:48.070> be<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.550> was<00:02:48.820> dealt<00:02:49.060> and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
hand your opponent's be it was dealt and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.380 
hand your opponent's be it was dealt and
therefore<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.050> important<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.770> analyze<00:02:51.390> both

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
therefore it's important to analyze both

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.810 
therefore it's important to analyze both
of<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.770> sets<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.220> balls<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.520> are<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.790> there

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
of the sets of balls that are out there

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820 
of the sets of balls that are out there
yours<00:02:55.360> as<00:02:55.600> well<00:02:55.960> as<00:02:56.140> your<00:02:56.350> opponents<00:02:56.770> for

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
yours as well as your opponents for

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.600 
yours as well as your opponents for
example<00:02:57.250> if<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:58.030> look<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.480> table<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.610> I

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
example if you look at this table and I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.930 
example if you look at this table and I
look<00:03:00.850> at<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.270> look<00:03:01.750> where<00:03:01.960> I'm<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.830> solids<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
look at I look where I'm the solids and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.020 
look at I look where I'm the solids and
I've<00:03:04.540> got<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.900> four<00:03:05.200> ball<00:03:05.440> right<00:03:06.010> here<00:03:06.370> it's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
I've got this four ball right here it's

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.750 
I've got this four ball right here it's
it's<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.600> an<00:03:07.720> impossible<00:03:08.290> position<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.980> also

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
it's in an impossible position I also

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.060 
it's in an impossible position I also
don't<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.480> ball<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.080> table<00:03:11.260> here

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
don't have a ball on the table here

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.430 
don't have a ball on the table here
that's<00:03:12.640> that's<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.360> that's<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:14.080> an<00:03:14.260> easy

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
that's that's this that's that's an easy

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.530 
that's that's this that's that's an easy
break<00:03:14.800> out<00:03:14.980> where<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:16.060> actually<00:03:16.210> go<00:03:16.510> over

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
break out where I can actually go over

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.930 
break out where I can actually go over
there<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.080> break<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.740> out<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:18.910> that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
there and break it out you can see that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.180 
there and break it out you can see that
but<00:03:19.750> on<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.870> other<00:03:20.110> hand<00:03:20.200> my<00:03:20.560> opponent<00:03:21.040> does

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
but on the other hand my opponent does

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.680 
but on the other hand my opponent does
because<00:03:21.460> my<00:03:21.580> opponent<00:03:22.030> with<00:03:22.150> his<00:03:22.180> fifteen

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because my opponent with his fifteen

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.290 
because my opponent with his fifteen
ball<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.110> example<00:03:23.530> or<00:03:23.770> this<00:03:24.310> 13<00:03:24.790> could<00:03:25.030> get<00:03:25.180> an

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
ball for example or this 13 could get an

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.670 
ball for example or this 13 could get an
angle<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.900> go<00:03:26.050> over<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.260> break<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.560> out

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
angle on it and go over and break it out

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.310 
angle on it and go over and break it out
therefore<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:27.610> cannot<00:03:28.030> assume<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.540> just

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
therefore I cannot assume that just

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.590 
therefore I cannot assume that just
because<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.920> can't<00:03:30.220> get<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.610> my<00:03:31.090> opponent

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
because I can't get out my opponent

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.140 
because I can't get out my opponent
can't<00:03:31.840> get<00:03:32.020> out<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.710> point<00:03:33.010> here<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.460> when<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
can't get out the point here is when you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.290 
can't get out the point here is when you
analyze<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.930> table<00:03:35.400> analyze<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.670> table<00:03:37.090> not

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
analyze the table analyze the table not

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.210 
analyze the table analyze the table not
only<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.750> your<00:03:37.960> balls<00:03:38.230> but<00:03:38.440> analyze<00:03:38.920> your

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
only of your balls but analyze your

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.700 
only of your balls but analyze your
opponent's<00:03:39.820> balls<00:03:40.030> too<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> other

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
opponent's balls too and then the other

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.480 
opponent's balls too and then the other
part<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.280> tip<00:03:42.520> here<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:44.170> have<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.710> you

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
part of the tip here is you have to you

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.030 
part of the tip here is you have to you
have<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.760> recognize<00:03:46.000> your<00:03:46.780> own<00:03:46.990> abilities<00:03:47.740> and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
have to recognize your own abilities and

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.250 
have to recognize your own abilities and
your<00:03:48.280> own<00:03:48.430> limitations<00:03:48.910> when<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.840> decide

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
your own limitations when you decide

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.780 
your own limitations when you decide
you're<00:03:50.560> going<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.740> get<00:03:50.920> out<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.430> need<00:03:51.550> to<00:03:51.610> be

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you're going to get out you need to be

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.810
