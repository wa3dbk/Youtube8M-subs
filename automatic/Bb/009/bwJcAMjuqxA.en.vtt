 during this meeting a 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.340

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.670
 sun jonny wilkison shroud debates 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.100
 and the people of Montpellier will start 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.290
 the fault thus allowing the half 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.750
 rugby club goalscorer 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.199
 Toulon to deflower the table 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 display after ten minutes of play on 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.809
 plunged into jonny grouping 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.699
 wilkinson does not pray and opens 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.670
 the score 3 to 0 the montpelliérains 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.799
 try to react very quickly on a 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.710
 regrouping there is a fault jonathan 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.449
 pelissier the bottom will be tacked 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.549
 even quite severely is by the way 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.280
 he will have to go out a few minutes later 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.890
 late injured the scrum half of the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.960
 montpellier rugby and it's françois 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 trinh duke who hands the two teams to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.070
 quarter of an hour of play tied 3 everywhere 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.700
 and then it will take a long time 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.320
 there were two penalties and drew mitchell 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.230
 tears the Montpellier defense a 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.420
 balloon that relayed hermit lones and 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.320
 I also suffer from such an eel 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.170
 in the Montpellier defense 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.430
 picked up close to the goal the ball 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 going to bounce back and that's john smith the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.700
 third South African line that goes 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.530
 plunge 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 here behind the line to mark the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.260
 first try of this meeting and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.810
 transformed by matt giteau 16 3 then 3 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.020
 additional points of the three 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.770
 Australian center quarter fake 19 to 3 to 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 half time 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.300
 upon resumption touring pressed 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.860
 the accelerator attacks large field of 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.350
 every three quarters and at the end of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.340
 line is david smith 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.710
 the samoa that come to mark the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.600
 second try of Toulon one 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.550
 magnificent action 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.820
 the Montpellier are in two - 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.750
 carrieu yellow egg cartons to 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:18.200
 hamilton and so the tours take 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.080
 now the wide 24 to 3 they are going 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.600
 mark a new roundabout test on 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.519
 seven throws in touch with orioli that 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.900
 come back among the big ones and who comes 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.209
 collapse in the end 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.500

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.360

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.800
 31 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 10 at that time of the match and it's not 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.000
 not finished because on this action these are 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.700
 the Montpellier who will try to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.890
 react mamuka gorgodze to the edge of 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.500
 this melee will get the balloon there 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.680
 tears the defense and marks the only one and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.250
 unique test of Montpellier one 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.660
 try only benoît paillaugue who has 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.670
 come into play will transform 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.459
 no question of snatching the Mamuka ball 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.400
 gorgodze that flattens and benoît 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.290
 paillaugue turns year to 31.10 are 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.420
 the last poets of the montpelliérains 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.510
 on the other hand, the tours are going to mark 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.280
 other goals will recover the ball 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.840
 on this long pass of françois 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.849
 trinh-duke like that had been the case at 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.700
 the go the toulonnaises steal the ball 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.720
 on the go know tdc of the draw on the turn 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.709
 this is the bonus test marked by drew 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.890
 mitchell 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.739
 here is an Australian who seizes he has 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.739
 well anticipated the shot and no one 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.079
 will not catch him he comes to score the 4th 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.709
 test of Montpellier cdc bonus 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.109
 that matt giteau transforms 38 to 10 it's 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.420
 heavy but not enough for Toulon 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.519
 who will shoot me a real fire 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.459
 fireworks for this Christmas and it's 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.049
 Stephen Hermitage who still has his brother 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.870
 has at his side who comes to score 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.480
 the referee asks the video me no 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.150
 worry we will see very well stephen 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.920
 hermitage that poses beautifully 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.500
 the ball in the corner that is 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.650
 done and so that's forty-three to 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.290
 ten toulon will move to the metro racing 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.180
 next Sunday while Montpellier 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.180
