00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.860
 Is it a day of a day 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.860
 Hm 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.900
 7 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.020
 The 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 Kedomo was also available in Hi everyone this guitar course beginning 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 Or it will be the flow of 3 code blues code 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.540
 I will introduce that phrase, but at the beginning with alternate picking 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.110
 It was 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:55.240
 Down fitting up picking alternately 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.250
 - It is among the first practice I say Kedomo banged 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.720
 I think it's fine if it's just down 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.740
 It is better to say that it is impossible, but the practice of the fingering to the last 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.990
 I think the Fu that kana not it good to try to incorporate Hey one it is in that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:16.330
 If you want to do the blues or rock from now on, it is a phrase that you hear quite often 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:21.710
 I think Fu that kana not a good idea to put on it that only because in now Monyo 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.350
 We will introduce the phrase, so if you are registered to play by all means by all means 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.110
 On this occasion 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:32.010
 If you find it difficult to get rid of it at first, use your index finger for 2 frets. 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.909
 I think it's okay even if you 've set up the word source 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:40.359
 So also in the 3rd fret 4th fret while registering 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.190
 The but is not going to wind Tteyuu middle finger ring finger 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.190
 Hmm 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 me 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.510
 me 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.510
 7 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.120
 In the feeling that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.980
 In it 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:07.000
 8 Kedomo is not made in the 3 corner that eab 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 Now that good people did and seemingly lower and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 me 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.660
 dare 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.230
 The people of the a as saying 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 But I think I'm the phrase the last difficult he is Hey 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.720
 Boo 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.000
 Hmm this may be a bit hard to do because I use this kind of thing 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.790
 Let's repeat 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 Yes I went back to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.670
 dare 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.670
 Good 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 rar 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.180
 If you go to the torii in the loop picking there are 6 in the practice of fingering series picking 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.480
 I will continue to practice 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.760
 On this occasion 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:04.140
 By all means a So this time that I used this phrase 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.810
 Also because I tried to create blues blues rock and say you or I such things 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.810
 Please be viewing Tara and I very well corner 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.380

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.380
 voodoo 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 Hmm 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.420
 Yup 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.420
 Me 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.420
 Hmm 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:57.370

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.370
