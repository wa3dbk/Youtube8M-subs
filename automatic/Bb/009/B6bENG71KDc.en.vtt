00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I also spoke with the patron saying that 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.230
 this is the kick of July and August in the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
 sense that you work and then grow it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.769
 team or isolation of cues 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.929
 interesting but especially me 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.170
 interested to see the inclusion of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.510
 new after five days of work with 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 double workouts and I'm happy with 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.199
 having had answers 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 the answers I wanted and obvious that is 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.849
 too early to work 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.250
 both for the mechanisms knowing that the ex 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 arrived two days ago and it shows that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.579
 still not inserted in certain 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 we will get there for a little while 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.170
 tui other 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 today I'm interested in it also interested me 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.020
 see the qualities of a player where 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.969
 keep flying 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 but beyond the goals that it is always 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.879
 important to make goals because they still give 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.289
 greater conviction to what 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 let's try it during training 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 but if we talk about zaza individually 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.750
 has made some good moves 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.320
 improve in others I don't want to be vigilant 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 deep and do one but that of 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 he wanted to do 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.820
 maybe the ball goes under the intersection 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.270
 however there are characteristics of the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.280
 players 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.409
 in the last twenty meters I don't 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 I will never remove that I am the fantasy 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.939
 creativity and I hope that there is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 there are many others who have this 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.860
 because football is also made of these 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.500
 things and we must not disperse but me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.119
 I hope that there are always but for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.610
 to get there you need a certain 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 organization I had so many defenders 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.259
 central and provided with midfielders 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 I'm adapting some players to some 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.729
 pro roles knowing that they can do it 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 because ante already in the last year when 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.930
 have some problems 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.790
 midfielders, I remind you that we are 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.530
 I had tried it also week is a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.000
 boy who in the past has done the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 center a track in Rome and has 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.150
 proved to also have good ones 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.729
 quality but not only today by lawrence 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.990
 even in training for good this there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.390
 we also need to do some 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 evaluations in the future maybe for me is 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 always a defenders, however, advances in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.130
 emergency is known to be a solution in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.080
 more 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.520
 curtis six days ago very well the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.100
 we have taken to the middle of it when 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.869
 something is there that can play 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.060
 along with missiroli and magnanelli 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.220
 it is not excluded then you know that I like it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.459
 see players playing soccer and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 that a hypothesis that in the future yes 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.420
 indeed it could be the teams will change 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640
 that will go to face that maybe you 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 will lead to lower a little bit of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.790
 more for their own sake but not for their strength 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.340
 must change our mentality of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.840
 seek to arrive at the door or 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.550
 at least to be proactive 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.810
 why change from a category 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.430
 other 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.830
 they do n't understand a question that I do 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.599
 they do often but I think that if one has 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 a mentality is not based on the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.540
 category but it is what it has inside 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.569
 I have a certain type of inside 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.220
 that is, hunting with carrying on maybe 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.319
 different interpreters but in the same way 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.599
 but for now being here I do everything 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.530
 I train to play this card for me 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.410
 then if the manager says little tomorrow 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.209
 to go away there is this team 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.340
 then he took up his job 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.010
 day by day how to do it 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.200
 without thinking too much about the market and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.290
 we make the case is what will come 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.930
 future then you will see the coach always has 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.519
 desire to always teach in short 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.620
 we find every day and therefore 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.290
 we improve these patterns every day 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.420
 that yes the other year they did well but 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.160
 it is only to be improved even more 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.080
 then with short with other attackers 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.599
 there is to learn there is to see in short 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.230
 so there is still a lot of work to do 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.019
 but with a smile in his mouth and ec 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.140
 in short, we certainly have fun 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.600
 zaza left would not make me a me 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.049
 it would suck but in short we are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.200
 boys get better then with work 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.200
 we can arrive 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.709
 where it seems then every day put 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.060
 there with the head to the training e 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.800
 they try to do good but only 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.290
 especially for ourselves 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.590
 the team we saw immediately is fine 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.550
 physically we are accusing a 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.360
 po first days of work 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.459
 however it is reinforced we try to 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.989
 be staying in series 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.190
 this year 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.959
 concerning my future I logically 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.660
 especially to try to stay here 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.879
 then the choices are made at the end of 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.389
 this retreat and you will see what ever mine 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.630
 future 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.970
 we are many behind and the coach to do 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.010
 play all ancient to vote the first 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.320
 day in the middle of the field since of 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.410
 way to true we have not 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.580
 my role is always the defender 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 I prefer central, but if necessary 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.600
 I can also play as a fullback
