they<00:02:02.760> do<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> come<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.540> dividers<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.390> they

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
they do not come with dividers but they

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.649 
they do not come with dividers but they
do<00:02:06.540> come<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.080> piece<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.409> paper<00:02:08.390> tells<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
do come with a piece of paper tells you

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.860 
do come with a piece of paper tells you
that<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.349> order<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> dividers<00:02:11.750> from<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
that you can order the dividers from the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.850 
that you can order the dividers from the
manufacturing<00:02:15.379> we're<00:02:16.379> like<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:16.709> dollars

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
manufacturing we're like two dollars

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.059 
manufacturing we're like two dollars
more<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.489> guess<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.269> 48<00:02:18.750> less<00:02:19.319> sure<00:02:19.620> how

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
more I guess to get 48 less sure how

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.940 
more I guess to get 48 less sure how
much<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.430> cost<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.049> don't<00:02:22.349> understand<00:02:22.709> why

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
much it cost so I don't understand why

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.769 
much it cost so I don't understand why
these<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.459> come<00:02:23.639> with<00:02:24.120> dividers<00:02:24.329> you

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:24.779 
these do not come with dividers you

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.450 
these do not come with dividers you
think<00:02:25.049> they'd<00:02:25.139> at<00:02:25.200> least<00:02:25.230> come<00:02:25.529> with<00:02:25.680> some<00:02:26.099> of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
think they'd at least come with some of

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.210 
think they'd at least come with some of
but<00:02:26.550> they<00:02:26.670> didn't<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.900> keep<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.320> mind<00:02:28.560> when

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
but they didn't so keep that mind when

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.630 
but they didn't so keep that mind when
you<00:02:29.340> buy<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.570> they<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.780> not<00:02:31.050> come<00:02:31.320> with

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
you buy this so they do not come with

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.010 
you buy this so they do not come with
dividers<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.300> drawers<00:02:35.060> also<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.780> back

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
is well opened up and you can see that

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.860 
is well opened up and you can see that
dust<00:02:41.550> can<00:02:41.760> easily<00:02:42.000> fly<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.660> make<00:02:42.810> sure
