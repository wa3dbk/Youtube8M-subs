00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
health is so much fun we you know we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.330 
health is so much fun we you know we
talk<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.840> lot<00:02:08.959> about<00:02:09.140> what<00:02:09.709> what<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.160> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
talk a lot about what what is that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.300 
talk a lot about what what is that
flavor<00:02:11.209> of<00:02:11.510> Zelda<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.740> know<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.860> think<00:02:12.980> there's

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
flavor of Zelda you know I think there's

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
flavor of Zelda you know I think there's
a<00:02:13.370> sense<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.760> realism<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.420> being<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> land<00:02:14.959> of

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
a sense of realism of being the land of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.110 
a sense of realism of being the land of
Hyrule<00:02:15.260> but<00:02:15.740> i<00:02:15.770> think<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.130> realism<00:02:16.670> comes

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
Hyrule but i think that realism comes

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.940 
Hyrule but i think that realism comes
from<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> characters<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.739> details

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
from the characters and that the details

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.060 
from the characters and that the details
at<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.520> scene<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.620> need<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.770> sense

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
at the scene you know you need a sense

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.830 
at the scene you know you need a sense
that<00:02:22.190> you're<00:02:22.400> actually<00:02:22.580> doing<00:02:23.030> these<00:02:23.360> actions

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that you're actually doing these actions

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.350 
that you're actually doing these actions
that<00:02:24.020> you're<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.410> one<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.150> sense

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
that you're in that one so in that sense

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.710 
that you're in that one so in that sense
pushing<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.470> huge<00:02:28.070> block<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:29.000> actually<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
pushing a huge block is actually kind of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.960 
pushing a huge block is actually kind of
absurd<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.459> don't<00:02:31.640> think<00:02:31.790> anybody

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
absurd you know I don't think anybody

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.390 
absurd you know I don't think anybody
wants<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.390> see<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.600> young<00:02:32.870> man<00:02:32.930> pushing<00:02:33.709> giant

look at the space when he's doing it up
off<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:46.220> that's<00:02:46.400> funny<00:02:46.730> when<00:02:47.060> you<00:02:47.150> actually
