00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.610
 servus together here is christian von 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 update point de and in this video 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.230
 I'll show you how to use the micro sd 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.450
 map and the micro sim card at mfg 3 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 1 places opposite the predecessor has 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 decided g3 made something new 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 namely the back not only from the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.400
 optics changed but the back 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 also made removable that means me 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 this can decrease by back 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.029
 according to various slots and also 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.270
 to access the battery and put it right there 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.770
 I also like my micro sd and mine 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 micro-sim-card that's what that means 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.850
 decided the 3 wanted to operate up to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 inevitably a micro sim card 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.410
 necessary that is called this format 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 There is also a nano sim card 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.160
 which is also a little smaller 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 about as big as this industry part 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.399
 this card then there are the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.230
 normal SIM card actually only 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.899
 Use this old mobile phone bone 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 comes as in the nokia 32 10 or 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.660
 like 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 you need this micro here 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.640
 sim card and when you become natural 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.210
 also a micro sd card around the internal 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.760
 memory of 16 or 32 gb 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 when the three decided to increase the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.619
 Comparison this is a normal one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
 sd card is not needed which we 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.409
 also too big relations here to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 As I said, lg 3d needs these 64 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.130
 gigabyte card very briefly on the edge of the lg 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.549
 3 supports up to two terabytes 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.140
 that is 2000 gigabytes 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.450
 currently there are such cards 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 not on the market this is a 64 gb 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 card for me absolutely sufficient 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.530
 are still 128 gb cards and mine 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.689
 opinion, it was already the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.000
 Two terabyte cards means more 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.159
 or less such a marketing trick around 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.659
 Buyer decided to lure three 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.820
 how the whole thing works now 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
 I show you and as I just said 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.259
 I have this Beck so have this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210
 removable on the back and we find on 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.950
 lower right edge find one here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 small slot with which I can help you 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.440
 I then put the fingernail on the lid 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.390
 raise 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 and accordingly , just these 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.460
 back plate and I think there 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.890
 of course my battery of 3000 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.110
 milliseconds is strong and two 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.590
 slots where I have the micro sd and the micro 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.780
 sim card can insert exactly 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 there around the migros in the micro sd card 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.930
 it is necessary to insert the first 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.520
 to take out the battery 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.720
 that means it does it in the beginning too 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.280
 No sense at all to the device 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.140
 just start because you can do it fast 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 wants to see what the surface looks like 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 but best first the micro sim and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.220
 if necessary, of course, the micro 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 insert sd card 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.410
 usually the slots 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.880
 arranged side by side that is to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.770
 example has me every micro sim cards 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.780
 slot there in micro sd card slot or 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.940
 just like there in and there sd-card slot 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.770
 decided that solved that so that 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 I can hope you can do it in two stages 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.040
 recognize on the video 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.440
 that means we have a fleet here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.460
 So visually a slot for 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.620
 both cards 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.390
 but they are two substances that is on 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.400
 the lower level I put the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.010
 micro sim card on the upper level 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.500
 I insert the micro sd card and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.239
 accordingly, the lg was too 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.700
 that means there have been here 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.640
 micros standing and in the upper area 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.989
 have me micro sd stand and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 Accordingly, I put the first 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.440
 micro sim card and you can completely 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.090
 good at this graphic as I see the 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.290
 sim card must insert namely with the 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.450
 flattened corner 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.700
 that must be on the upper left and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.320
 logically we fall this bronze 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 the connectors where also the data 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.140
 sometimes stored on it are the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.320
 contacts and stuff 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.060
 that comes down and accordingly 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.310
 Can I insert that as well and 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 then push the micro SIM card up 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.880
 to stop just with this slot if 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.930
 i want to take that out i can 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.650
 because just with the finger again 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.060
 pull out 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.970
 this actually works relatively 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.080
 good if it should say something 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.970
 also with such a small one 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.640
 Spiky object carefully just this 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.530
 sim card again push that out 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.190
 is called micro sim card inserted now 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.510
 just want my 64 gb micro sd card the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.130
 I put here on the silver 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.239
 carriage 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.160
 we can see the currently is the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.090
 congruent and push that too 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.950
 just forward 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.800
 to a small crack or breed 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.060
 the something purely and just until the stop 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.760
 is then synonymous this micro sd card 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.560
 lg g3 were sunk and i can now 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.269
 finally working with the device that is 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.169
 I just have to insert the battery 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.870
 I take my back cover 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.880
 would be like the whole here for jail and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.530
 is fed press my power 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.139
 button of logically the at 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.300
 gt3 is on the back and see 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.310
 that the device already starts and ready 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.800
 is actually the implementation of the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.840
 micro-sim and micro sd card is waiting now 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.700
 I still until the call comes 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.070
 to enter my pin and then I can 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.320
 also work with the LG G3 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.600
 that 's it for the video how to do that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.729
 micro sim and the micro sd at lg g3 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.380
 Thank you for seeing me 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.330
 I would like to comment on comments and 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.770
 I'm also happy about suggestions 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.770
 Christ talked about it
