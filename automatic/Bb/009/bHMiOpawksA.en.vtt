00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 and welcome to extras hardware 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.779
 Today we'll take a look at each other 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 a little closer 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.690
 on the homepage arrived us right 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 clear categories on how he 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.070
 is particularly interested in the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.710
 There are also gaming systems of these 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.850
 quite a lot but for now we see that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.140
 These also in many categories 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 be divided 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 what the search for specific pc it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.699
 Quite simply I have us of course 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 once again two special pcs 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.790
 We also picked out the same 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 to take a closer look 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.879
 the first system is a poor de system 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.280
 this costs 799 euro was installed 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.860
 amd fx-8150 eight gigabytes 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 RAM is a rather 9 280 and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 other components we ourselves 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 of course, as always, a little closer 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.160
 to look in detail 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.460
 in sum, these cost 632 euros 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.289
 that is called matyka 167 euros on it and that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 is in my opinion a bit too much 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.300
 everything you pay over 100 euros on it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.729
 in my opinion is not quite 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.560
 in order 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.700
 but the pc is relatively good for that 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.979
 balanced 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.770
 Although the processor has more power than 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.390
 the graphics card but still if you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 it is often considered intel 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.189
 core as seven with a gtx 750 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 connected then that's pretty good 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.840
 well, nothing that you talk well 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.000
 But at least it needs progress 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 but I also definitely like that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.770
 there is a configurator on this site 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.229
 still can change a lot 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.049
 the second pc is called island systems 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.470
 this costs about 1000 euro installed 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.110
 became an intel core i5 4690 k 8 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.850
 gigabytes of memory of a he 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.979
 1990 and other components we 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.010
 of course, as always, in detail 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.290
 will look 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.690
 together, the fun costs at similar 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.380
 components about 836 euro 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.300
 that means you pay about 163 euros on it 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.330
 which is no longer acceptable 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.490
 area is but I have to say this 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.920
 I like it from the demixing pc 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.240
 a little better than the other one 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.340
 because a rather 9 290 employees and 690 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.500
 k compares well 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.630
 Unfortunately, the graphics cards are here in the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 reference design is what it exactly fits 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.920
 that usually means pretty much 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.860
 loud and very nice can be warned 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.300
 and that is rather ugly 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.680
 we come to the last point and that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.450
 the customer service 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.090
 I have to say it was pretty hard 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 via cable to find out something 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.740
 I do not know why it's quibeldey 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.510
 relatively unknown I do not know 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.490
 however I have to excellent 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.860
 point org some found there are the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.870
 People very happy with the whole 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.480
 But I also have a single opinion 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.450
 something out so looking forums 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.250
 like toms hardware de where i just go 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.270
 such a few individual experiences and such 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270
 go have read 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.400
 I would say we discuss 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.900
 final shop again ml screen 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.130
 and maybe go to 12 points 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.200
 something more accurate 1 and 4 is now 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.970
 actually like bild.de so leave it 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.910
 So say the choice has for me 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.860
 a 23 will get the pick itself 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.870
 it is not the biggest but there is a lot 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.280
 very many categories and in these 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.070
 There are still some categories 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.260
 so a lot of pc are so very much 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.720
 many pcs available you too 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.310
 very easy to find out the price 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.830
 performance ratio bude family with 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.860
 a 42 rated what it is 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.170
 you pay 160 to 170 euros on the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.480
 systems we saw today 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.370
 So you just easy 70 percent 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.590
 has to pay more than what in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.890
 order is here could simply not 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.690
 rated better than a 421 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.459
 But I just have to give the time 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.440
 pc I did not even think so 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.510
 bad so I mean that 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.060
 processor with the video card relative 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.920
 well, the graphics card partially harmonizes 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.750
 in reference design or cheap 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.770
 components were installed that is 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.110
 of course, of course 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.360
 thanks to the configurator you can but here 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.070
 to change something you might want 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.959
 but should not do that because the price 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.570
 performance ratio is not good anyway 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.370
 is and there is still the customer service 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.230
 and because I've been so hard 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.549
 there something really useful and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.530
 sure to find that 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.510
 Let's leave that a bit today 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.940
 outside if I then would have to rate 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.140
 then it would probably be at 18 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 so relatively good 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.290
 and then when we get the customer service 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.290
 kiewel comes to the outside 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.100
 total to a 3.0 so 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.390
 could be improved if we could 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
 But customer service is really involved 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.920
 then you would contribute about 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.320
 a 2 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.270
 you end up having to do that for 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.640
 decide for yourself if you have that note 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.770
 now with tent or not i would like her 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.170
 They do not really leave out there 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.310
 it's just that there but also for 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.350
 I have been here again today 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.230
 Hope you liked it or you liked it 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.460
 talk to you at least a little 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.320
 otherwise I wish you this 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.000
 make a wonderful day and 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.550
 I hope to see you next time 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.210
 People are good and see you again 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.210
 next time
