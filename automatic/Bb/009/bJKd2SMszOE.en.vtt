00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:03.926
 Italy, or rather, the people who live 

00:00:04.235 --> 00:00:08.040
 in Italy, they use nature four 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.667
 times more than the ecosystems in 

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:13.942
 Italy are able to renew. And the 

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.180
 question is: "Is it risky?" 

00:00:24.647 --> 00:00:26.305
 Hi, I'm Mathis 

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.244
 Wackernagel, president of Global 

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.671
 Footprint Network, therefore we are active 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.418
 at a global level to ask ourselves this 

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:34.106
 he asks: "How much nature do we have and 

00:00:34.436 --> 00:00:35.574
 how many do we use? " 

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.492
 We can say that at the level 

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:41.218
 worldwide we have about 1.8, to say the 

00:00:41.497 --> 00:00:43.604
 this year only 1.7 hectares of space 

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:47.151
 ecological production, or areas 

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.228
 used for grazing, cultivated land, areas 

00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:53.654
 wetlands, woods, productive areas 

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.203
 of the ocean, where there are many fish, e 

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.650
 if we add them all up we come to around 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.199
 1.8 hectares per person and with this data 

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:01.187
 we can ask ourselves the 

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:02.786
 question “How much surface do I need 

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:04.814
 for my cotton? "" How much surface 

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:06.531
 do I need it for my milk? "" Quanta 

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:07.493
 surface I need to absorb mine 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.358
 CO2? ”These are all questions that 

00:01:10.638 --> 00:01:11.886
 involve a struggle for the surface, 

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:13.445
 because life itself is a struggle for 

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:17.721
 surface. In Italy you have about 1.2 hectares 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.086
 global for an activity and use four 

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:26.532
 many times. Therefore, use 

00:01:26.942 --> 00:01:27.931
 a surface equal to four times 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.519
 Italy, and if everyone in the world lived 

00:01:30.028 --> 00:01:31.117
 like the Italians, on average they would be 

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:33.005
 needed three planets. It is likely that 

00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:35.733
 we underestimate the situation; what 

00:01:37.012 --> 00:01:38.390
 we can also say with this data is 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.949
 that our demand for humanity is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.027
 equal to about 50% more than in 

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:44.706
 what the earth can renew. In 

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.222
 other words, about 18 are needed 

00:01:47.523 --> 00:01:48.942
 months because the planet restores that 

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:51.670
 that we consume in a year. For the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.988
 2014, the date was 

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:56.237
 approximately August 22: 

00:01:56.626 --> 00:01:57.635
 we pointed out that the Overshoot 

00:01:58.276 --> 00:02:00.195
 Day [day of overcoming] is not 

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.152
 an exact date. As with the 

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:06.110
 money, you can spend more than 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.549
 how much you earn, for a 

00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:08.769
 for example, they can be used 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.308
 excessively for a while 

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:11.697
 of time. Fishing weakens a 

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:19.815
 bit faster. CO2 can 

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.544
 accumulate for a period 

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.093
 long enough, but have effects a 

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:25.924
 long term. In numerous areas of the 

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:27.424
 world water availability 

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:29.954
 drinking is always lower and that has 

00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:33.295
 an impact on agriculture. In this 

00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:37.116
 moment I talk to you from California, where 

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:40.637
 we are in a period of drought and the 

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.346
 first water resources that come 

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:43.908
 those for agriculture are closed, 

00:02:44.558 --> 00:02:46.038
 because they are less profitable for water, but 

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:47.758
 since California has a lot of money 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.458
 compared, for example, to Bangladesh, 

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:50.169
 we can buy food in the market 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.941
 international; but the reality is that the 

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.344
 agricultural productivity without water is 

00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:57.567
 much much more scarce. Of 

00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.428
 consequently we can modify the 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.870
 upward or downward purchasing power, 

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:03.712
 we can modify our request 

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:06.605
 but, ultimately, also in the medium term 

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:09.287
 term if you use more than what 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:10.980
 you have the consequences you will make 

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:12.708
 feel. And when we, as Global 

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:15.129
 Footprint Network, let's look at the crisis 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.644
 of the euro that has lasted since 2008, is difficult 

00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:22.907
 do not establish links with the 

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:25.880
 resource situation. The so-called 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.883
 PIGS countries, Portugal, Greece, Italy and 

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.707
 Spain, they got loans 

00:03:32.017 --> 00:03:33.329
 facilitated by the European Union for 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.121
 build their infrastructure and 

00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.434
 infrastructures require more resources for 

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:38.796
 their operation: airports or new 

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:40.218
 hotel, or new roads, traffic 

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:42.190
 increases and requires more resources, 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.183
 therefore these countries have returned 

00:03:46.545 --> 00:03:47.516
 vulnerable by accepting this money a 

00:03:49.548 --> 00:03:50.489
 facilitated conditions, without being in 

00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:52.962
 able to maintain productivity 

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.514
 economic and a balanced budget: 

00:03:54.824 --> 00:04:00.884
 worldwide, 85% of the 

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:03.056
 population lives in countries that 

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:05.848
 they use more than theirs 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:11.385
 ecosystems can renew, therefore 

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.297
 we have an ever-increasing number 

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:16.300
 of countries in ecological deficit. Some of 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.422
 they are high-income countries, like 

00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:20.014
 Switzerland, but there are others too 

00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:21.265
 like China and India that have levels 

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:23.347
 of much lower consumption and see 

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:24.970
 a purchasing power deficit. Therefore 

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:27.813
 for 71% of the world population 

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.505
 the situation is enough 

00:04:29.775 --> 00:04:31.958
 complex; the resources are not 

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:35.491
 sufficient as is not sufficient 

00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.632
 contractual power to access 

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:40.346
 easily to extra resources from other countries 

00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:42.618
 or more competition for resources 

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:46.862
 tight, complicating things, the 

00:04:49.384 --> 00:04:50.746
 competition is getting more and more strenuous e 

00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:54.379
 this means that what it really is 

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:58.232
 important is my ability to 

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:01.617
 negotiation for those resources. From the 

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.137
 1980 the slice of the global pie that i 

00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:06.710
 Swiss citizens take home themselves 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.581
 halved, because the expansion 

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.816
 economic has become faster in 

00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.127
 other areas of the world, the population is 

00:05:14.558 --> 00:05:17.350
 increased, so the Swiss have 

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.110
 their power halved 

00:05:19.772 --> 00:05:21.154
 contractual relationship with the rest of the world. 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:22.510
 Switzerland will see its situation 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.333
 getting complicated: although now it can 

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:27.265
 shield yourself in the short term, 

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:30.060
 structurally it is traveling a 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.912
 path that will yield enough 

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.296
 difficult for the Swiss economy on 

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:40.143
 long-term success; Just today, 

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:42.716
 in October 2014, we see a decline 

00:05:43.607 --> 00:05:45.760
 of oil price and would come from 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.545
 think “wow, this means that there is 

00:05:48.835 --> 00:05:50.616
 there is plenty of it, "but the appearance 

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:54.132
 interesting is the following: most 

00:05:54.382 --> 00:05:56.535
 part of the OPEC countries is not able to 

00:05:56.795 --> 00:05:58.287
 achieve the budget goals of the 

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.600
 own government if the oil price 

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:03.765
 is less than $ 100 a barrel. What 

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:06.199
 it means? Because they depend a lot on 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.404
 these revenues continue to extract more 

00:06:09.674 --> 00:06:11.957
 oil although the price is lower, 

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:13.680
 because they need money: and in 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.536
 many sectors of our economy, 

00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:19.249
 we make a real one 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.373
 liquidation. Make revenue 

00:06:22.655 --> 00:06:24.507
 means selling my resources in 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.470
 as quickly as possible, we sell 

00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:27.612
 silverware, we sell furniture, 

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:28.723
 we sell my grandmother's dress! IS 

00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:31.348
 certainly true that farmers do not 

00:06:31.668 --> 00:06:32.820
 they are well paid at this time 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.302
 resources are not profitable, however 

00:06:34.563 --> 00:06:36.599
 without farms, without food, it would be 

00:06:36.866 --> 00:06:38.540
 very difficult to live. I don't mean 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.425
 that there will be no food, but there will be 

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:44.400
 less for each person, the constraints 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.722
 they will be more tight and will increase 

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:49.859
 conflicts: the fact that Italy uses four 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:51.922
 times what he has available in 

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:55.348
 its ecosystems is an incisive factor? 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.192
 Italy must deal first with 

00:06:57.452 --> 00:06:59.235
 this question, and understand what 

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:01.240
 it really matters: having an economy 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.384
 stable? Ensuring employment? 

00:07:03.683 --> 00:07:06.469
 Have a prosperous company? How much it is 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.024
 Should Italy consume? Italy is 

00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:12.020
 at the forefront in many areas for 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.046
 get to these results. Self 

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:17.957
 compare the Italian cities, the cities 

00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:20.638
 classics, and I think the example more 

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:23.653
 clear is Siena, because it has banned the 

00:07:23.924 --> 00:07:25.727
 car circulation, it is compact, it is 

00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:27.571
 possible to move on foot, with city 

00:07:27.952 --> 00:07:33.424
 such as Houston, America, or Dallas, or 

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:36.190
 any other huge and extensive city, 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.634
 taking a person and making it 

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.057
 transfer from Houston to Siena, without 

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.402
 provide her with any education, 

00:07:42.682 --> 00:07:44.316
 will automatically use one 

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:46.721
 amount of resources three or four times 

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:48.746
 lower and probably more 

00:07:48.986 --> 00:07:53.126
 happy, you will lose weight and you will feel more 

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:55.170
 healthy. Therefore there are numerous ways to 

00:07:55.501 --> 00:07:57.265
 which we can address these issues, 

00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:02.054
 which I think are important. 

00:08:02.295 --> 00:08:03.609
 I'll stop here, because I could talk 

00:08:03.908 --> 00:08:04.780
 to infinity: these arguments mi 

00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:05.342
 they are very passionate.
