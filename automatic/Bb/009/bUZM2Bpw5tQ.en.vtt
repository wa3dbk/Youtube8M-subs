00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.309
 so if you are interested or you are his 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 asks please continue 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.730
 I also want to watch this video 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.190
 share with you your thoughts 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 on the topic that generally helped me 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.420
 bring your skin and support it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 reasonably good condition therefore 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050
 let's start i never had big 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 I never had problems with my skin 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 big-big strong acne rashes 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.279
 amounts of acne and so on overall 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 my skin was normal always of course 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.270
 there were some pimples they periodically 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.960
 now there are always china 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 limitations 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 but, no less, to make it better even 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 while it seems to me helped me 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 cosmetics clinique them known 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.780
 the three-step system is cleansing 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.920
 toning and moisturizing 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.360
 accordingly, I used it under 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.610
 my skin type is normal to me 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 prone to fat I used but not 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.829
 less than a year exactly this system and me 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.539
 it seems that somehow she 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.120
 balanced and steadily held in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 good condition my skin and then I 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 already started changing cosmetics but skin from 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.900
 this did not become worse now I 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 I use cosmetics which I generally 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.979
 pretty each of the products that i 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 I'll show you some, but I 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.760
 I can tell you a good option 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.040
 now I do not have but they were before 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.990
 let's start our morning facial 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.479
 me starts with washing like this 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 milk from la rosh pose toleran 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.850
 she is called all the names I will sign 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.570
 below you like me basically but 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.150
 I like the moisturizer more 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.549
 for the face from clarence extract cotton 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.259
 now I do n't have but this milk 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.540
 I have very little time left 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.540
 over, I will definitely buy a replacement 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.280
 Klarans myself and I also use this one 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.649
 here 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.930
 cleansing cleansing gel from n with u flowed 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.250
 with which I also really like and on 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.290
 I really you are so much 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.030
 I will buy well not soon but not 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.159
 less about clarence keep in mind with 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.189
 cotton extract after washing 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.810
 I always always use tonic 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.520
 For the face here I can not and on another to me 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.649
 differently uncomfortable I like 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 after washing tones up your face 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.310
 close pores let's say it seems to me 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.450
 that reception is better so affects my 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.569
 the skin is now in my 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.849
 yunodk given but I really like it again 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.920
 same clarence lotion with iris extract and 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.930
 when i run out of code do i rather have 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.360
 just buy yourself clarence because 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.430
 filed on me though conducts makeup and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.140
 she is a good wow effect code she is not 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.930
 produces i probably just come back 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.970
 clarence after i applied 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.920
 I rubbed my skin with lotion 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.410
 I use face cream in the cold 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.810
 years now i have been using la rosh cream 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.230
 posture which is called 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.739
 and jim and pianca creeks will write everything under 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.239
 video extra rich good cream me he 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.519
 I like it and it is quite inexpensive 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.150
 regarding the price of the cream which i 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.280
 got used to 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.260
 that is, I usually use luxury 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.480
 cosmetics or to salon cosmetics for 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.610
 faces and this cream is in my 800 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 rubles in principle it is not expensive I say 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.840
 if you compare how much your cosmetics under 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 eyes i use cream now 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.470
 again, here's a kremchik with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.930
 grape extract 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.079
 all sorts of wine extracts called sauce 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.850
 good enough but for the winter he told me 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.350
 still seems easy java live now 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.420
 I use it simply because I started and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.790
 how not to finish the cream not quite 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.459
 good for cream me a lot more on 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.220
 winter and you can even like summer 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.620
 here 's kills cream with avocado extract 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.269
 he is super tight so nutritious 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.760
 nutritional very good i love just 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.319
 under my eyes, good hydration seems to me 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.579
 that it is very important to moisturize the skin under 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.459
 eyes because she is very thin 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.319
 very so easily damaged quickly 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.970
 dries and because pony him anyway 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.690
 make-up it must be applied 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.299
 moisturize 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.280
 next evening my departure will in principle 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.500
 Now duplicate morning care but 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.540
 start by removing cosmetics if i 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.459
 painted with make-up then 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.980
 first I will shoot it like this 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.739
 milk from chanel 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.299
 which I absolutely do not like him I 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.069
 I absolutely do not recommend you 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.810
 I write the name to know what I have 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.980
 in view of 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.200
 why because she terribly shoots 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.359
 makeup it is expensive it costs not 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.450
 less than two thousand rubles I do not advise 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.280
 I advise you milk from la rosh pose to me 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.910
 really like this firm either 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.290
 a bit early 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.970
 called as here is this gel for 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.650
 washing back to there milk for 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.140
 sensitive skin and can be removed 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.690
 eye makeup super removes nothing at all 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.990
 I do not have to buy it for five years 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.090
 then they gave it to me like this 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.220
 would torment they make-up well yes 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.740
 okay 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.340
 farther I again we tolerant you 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.500
 I rub my face 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.080
 Well, either here is the skin of the essence of the bone now 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.880
 finish legrand wipe kodali face 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.160
 and put on face depending on 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.870
 what was that day like if i was on 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.440
 the street was cold then I most likely 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.360
 Apply oil from Clarens my oil 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.210
 lotus extract 2 fat or 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.800
 combination skin, it does not fatten your 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.950
 skin after it is actually skin 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.890
 the next morning becomes just super she 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.650
 so nourished but not brilliant fat 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.960
 she is exactly like some kind of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.520
 already from inside all glowed fresh 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.770
 rested even if you are not too 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.790
 slept a lot but of course this oil 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.140
 constantly year-round and 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.360
 monthly use can not they need 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.280
 use courses center I use 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.630
 either a month in a month or in general 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.370
 by necessity ie for example i 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.740
 walked it was cold then in the evening i 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.570
 I will put oil to better soak my 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.580
 skin if for example i was at home or on 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.120
 the street is warm then I just put the cream on 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.600
 clarence hydra clinch is called this 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.330
 kremik here and so he looks normal in 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.550
 principle light cream I have it again 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.500
 and I have it for normal and dry skin 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.980
 because in winter my skin is prone to be 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.140
 to dry well in general good cream by the way 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.700
 more about oil clarence it since it 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.590
 on for oily or combination skin 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.480
 she doesn't exactly make me worse 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.830
 inflammation she removes at the gate that is 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.570
 it contains special oil 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.430
 suitable for this skin type 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.280
 which take into account what can be on it 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.770
 be inflammations and she she is butter them 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.690
 heals suddenly if there is any at 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.210
 me pinpoint flaws then i use 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.030
 here is such 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.890
 gel drying from on her here and so 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.260
 he looks basically i'm as far as i am 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.760
 remember there is a deuce means there is this one 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.220
 of two there is some other 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.750
 a means that supposedly speeds up 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.460
 education you have a pimple if you 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.840
 feel that he will soon be this one 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.190
 he is already drying 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.960
 I use this and in principle he 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.610
 really works but not for one 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.360
 night probably either it depends 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:39.000
 the degree of inflammation on your face 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.160
 also depending on your state 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.590
 skin either i just sara do 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.389
 I do brushing regularly I do 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.220
 cleansing mask and I really like this 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.639
 mask from the euro is marching it is not so expensive 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.590
 as 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.770
 how to be luxury or professional 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.340
 masks here and so she looks ultra 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.010
 wedge great mask three minutes 3 5 minutes 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.510
 you need to keep it then wash it on 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.700
 not after her face the next morning too 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.850
 wonderful color becomes smoother and 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.010
 somehow small inflammation she can 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.950
 dry essentially nothing of course 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.810
 removes cleaner looks at the face moisturizer 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.669
 I have already ended by not the first 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.990
 I hover this mask and very bad 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:20.370
 again la roche-posay hydraphase 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.960
 intense mask is good enough i 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.760
 her and ours that is not as 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.289
 it says there for a few minutes on 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.050
 ten minutes then clean I'm just ours 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:30.990
 mind sleeping with her and wonderful 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.889
 works sometimes i use if 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.320
 for example I have some kind of event 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:36.000
 let's say planned or something else 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.710
 I want to like my complexion 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.900
 even more even cosmetics easier 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.680
 I laid him down better and I take that hunger 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.090
 masked antioxidant from malin voice i'm not 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.669
 I know how to read tamarka 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:50.310
 honest word with no idea so you can 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:52.440
 write not if you know honestly 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.240
 she obviously will not say she is worth her money 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.830
 because I have a special super effect from 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.960
 I don't see her, but she's probably something 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.720
 doing good for my skin because 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.729
 she is very praised and somehow for some reason she 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.220
 everyone likes 1 and I use it I will tell 

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:07.349
 I guess I'll buy it a second time but 

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.150
 Overall, the mask is not bad but that's my whole 

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:10.530
 winter care at the moment I hope that 

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.690
