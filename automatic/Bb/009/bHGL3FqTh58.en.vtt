what I would need could go I could have

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.049 
what I would need could go I could have
gone<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.690> smaller<00:00:52.050> sized<00:00:52.320> battery<00:00:52.739> but

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
gone with a smaller sized battery but

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.130 
gone with a smaller sized battery but

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
again these with the cheapest so they

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.490 
again these with the cheapest so they
worked<00:00:55.320> out<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> best<00:00:57.199> just<00:00:58.199> finished

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
worked out the best just finished

going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> forget<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.490> tomorrow<00:01:14.670> that's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
going to forget that tomorrow that's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.960 
going to forget that tomorrow that's
gonna<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> positive<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:17.759> are

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gonna go to the positive so these are

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
gonna go to the positive so these are
wired<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> series<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> yellow

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
wired in series and then that yellow

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
wired in series and then that yellow
wire<00:01:19.590> goes<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> way<00:01:20.159> back<00:01:20.689> connects<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
wire goes all the way back connects the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
wire goes all the way back connects the
two<00:01:21.960> sides<00:01:22.229> together<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.630> then<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> negative

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
two sides together and then the negative

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
two sides together and then the negative
side<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.680> into<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> motor<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> motor

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
side go into the motor and the motor

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.749 
side go into the motor and the motor
controller<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.810> number<00:01:28.110> eight<00:01:28.259> is

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
controller go here is number eight is

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
controller go here is number eight is
the<00:01:29.759> charge<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> comes<00:01:30.960> from<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> charger

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the charge that comes from the charger

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
the charge that comes from the charger
so<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.670> connected<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so that's gonna get connected there and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.249 
so that's gonna get connected there and
then<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:34.770> side<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> charger<00:01:36.259> gets

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
then the other side of the charger gets

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
then the other side of the charger gets
wired<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.860> line<00:01:38.400> side<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> contactor<00:01:39.509> which

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
off they're gonna get cut off I had them

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.400 
off they're gonna get cut off I had them
on<00:02:46.790> there<00:02:47.030> just<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.390> help<00:02:47.540> me<00:02:47.690> move<00:02:47.840> around<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
on there just to help me move around and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.750 
on there just to help me move around and
everything<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.010> case<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.340> wanted<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.640> mount

something<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.330> left<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.290> they're

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
something I left it but they're

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.130 
something I left it but they're
eventually<00:02:51.590> gonna<00:02:51.860> trimmed<00:02:52.730> off<00:02:53.050> except<00:02:54.050> the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
eventually gonna trimmed off except the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.220 
eventually gonna trimmed off except the
car<00:02:54.350> it's<00:02:54.470> not<00:02:54.500> as<00:02:54.710> long<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.510> did<00:02:56.510> some<00:02:56.750> weight

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
car it's not as long I did some weight

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:08.200 
car it's not as long I did some weight
calculations<00:03:06.280> each<00:03:07.280> battery<00:03:07.790> pack<00:03:08.000> weighs

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.010 
calculations each battery pack weighs
141<00:03:09.080> pounds<00:03:09.560> that's<00:03:10.550> 141<00:03:11.270> pounds<00:03:11.630> per<00:03:11.780> side

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
141 pounds that's 141 pounds per side

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.660 
141 pounds that's 141 pounds per side
they<00:03:12.380> are<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.590> there<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:15.100> got<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.130> hundred

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
they are in there I got a hundred

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.430 
they are in there I got a hundred
seventeen<00:03:17.239> pounds<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.320> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
seventeen pounds on the right of the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.120 
seventeen pounds on the right of the
rear<00:03:18.800> axle<00:03:19.220> 80<00:03:19.970> pounds<00:03:20.360> in<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.510> front<00:03:21.130> so

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
rear axle 80 pounds in the front so

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.180 
rear axle 80 pounds in the front so
that's<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.340> total<00:03:22.640> cart<00:03:22.880> weight<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.120> 479<00:03:23.630> pounds

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
that's a total cart weight of 479 pounds

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.850 
that's a total cart weight of 479 pounds
plus<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.250> rider<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.120> figure<00:03:26.570> 150<00:03:27.440> 200

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
plus the rider so I figure 150 200

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.590 
plus the rider so I figure 150 200
pounds<00:03:28.070> for<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> rider<00:03:29.320> 479<00:03:30.320> 579<00:03:31.310> 679<00:03:32.060> for<00:03:32.570> a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
pounds for a rider 479 579 679 for a

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.170 
pounds for a rider 479 579 679 for a
200-pound<00:03:33.050> rider<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:34.070> under<00:03:34.310> 700<00:03:34.790> pounds

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
200-pound rider just under 700 pounds

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.199 
200-pound rider just under 700 pounds
will<00:03:35.870> be<00:03:35.989> heavier<00:03:36.320> than<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.560> wanted<00:03:36.890> but<00:03:40.209> again

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
will be heavier than I wanted but again

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.030 
will be heavier than I wanted but again
went<00:03:41.420> with<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> 72<00:03:42.020> volt<00:03:42.230> system<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.739> those<00:03:42.800> big

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
went with a 72 volt system and those big

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.860 
went with a 72 volt system and those big
batteries<00:03:43.459> which<00:03:43.640> really<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.180> what<00:03:44.209> kicked<00:03:44.720> up

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
batteries which really is what kicked up

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.610 
batteries which really is what kicked up
the<00:03:44.900> weight<00:03:45.580> have<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.930> 87<00:03:47.930> pound<00:03:48.110> forklift

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
the weight have a 87 pound forklift

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.080 
the weight have a 87 pound forklift
motor<00:03:48.860> in<00:03:49.040> there<00:03:49.190> which<00:03:49.489> is<00:03:49.610> a<00:03:49.640> lot<00:03:49.820> of<00:03:49.940> weight

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
motor in there which is a lot of weight

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.820

I'm<00:03:50.720> really<00:03:50.989> starting<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.350> get<00:03:51.440> concerned

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
I'm really starting to get concerned

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.640 
I'm really starting to get concerned
about<00:03:51.950> my<00:03:52.190> bearings<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:54.019> axle<00:03:54.470> and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
about my bearings and the axle and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.140 
about my bearings and the axle and
everything<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.610> stress<00:03:55.850> on<00:03:55.970> these

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
everything and the stress on these

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.000 
everything and the stress on these
wheels<00:03:56.800> but<00:03:57.800> we'll<00:03:58.370> see<00:03:58.519> how<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.760> goes

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
wheels but we'll see how it goes

steering's<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.070> little<00:04:01.280> tough<00:04:01.459> right<00:04:01.580> now<00:04:01.730> of

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
steering's a little tough right now of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.370 
steering's a little tough right now of
course<00:04:02.450> there's<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:02.810> much<00:04:02.959> weight<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.350> very

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
course there's so much weight is very

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.740 
course there's so much weight is very
hard<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:04.670> have<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.850> very<00:04:05.030> small<00:04:05.330> amount<00:04:05.390> of

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
hard you have a very small amount of

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.759 
hard you have a very small amount of
mechanical<00:04:06.110> advantage<00:04:06.560> there<00:04:08.769> hopefully

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
mechanical advantage there hopefully

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.530 
mechanical advantage there hopefully
when<00:04:10.130> it's<00:04:10.160> moving<00:04:10.489> it<00:04:10.730> will<00:04:11.209> be<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.330> whole<00:04:11.510> lot

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
when it's moving it will be a whole lot

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.930 
when it's moving it will be a whole lot
easier<00:04:11.739> because<00:04:12.739> wide<00:04:13.070> tires<00:04:13.370> don't<00:04:13.670> have<00:04:13.910> a

so<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.290> will<00:04:16.470> say<00:04:16.680> there's<00:04:16.859> some<00:04:17.070> learning

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
so I will say there's some learning

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.300 
so I will say there's some learning
curves<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.480> went<00:04:18.690> through<00:04:19.160> still<00:04:20.160> not

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
curves I went through still not

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.770 
curves I went through still not
completely<00:04:20.790> done<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.120> seat<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.449> still<00:04:21.660> not

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
completely done the seat is still not

completely done the seat is still not
mounted<00:04:22.520> it's<00:04:23.520> gonna<00:04:23.699> get<00:04:23.940> foam<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.930> there<00:04:25.440> so

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
mounted it's gonna get foam in there so

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.659 
mounted it's gonna get foam in there so
that's<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.750> started<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.840> project<00:04:31.669> planning

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
that's it started the project planning

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.610 
that's it started the project planning
it<00:04:32.910> last<00:04:33.120> November<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:33.930> it's<00:04:34.139> taking<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> little

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
it last November so it's taking a little

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.870 
it last November so it's taking a little
less<00:04:34.800> than<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:35.040> year<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.280> obviously<00:04:35.699> I<00:04:35.729> have

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
less than a year and obviously I have
