not really trying at all number three
did<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> mole<00:00:55.680> use<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> mat<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> timer<00:00:56.670> in

did the mole use a mat and timer in
let's<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.420> outside<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:58.530> top<00:00:58.829> suspects<00:00:59.550> are

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
let's go outside my top suspects are

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.930 
let's go outside my top suspects are
Finn<00:00:59.969> Lee<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.809> Chandler<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> Lee<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.789> been

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
Finn Lee and Chandler and Lee just been

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
Finn Lee and Chandler and Lee just been
out<00:01:03.090> there<00:01:03.359> Chandler<00:01:04.110> came<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> say<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.549> oh

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
out there Chandler came to say like oh

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
out there Chandler came to say like oh
good<00:01:06.000> yeah<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> five<00:01:06.570> point<00:01:06.810> four<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.140> get

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
good yeah the five point four would get

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.480 
good yeah the five point four would get
a<00:01:07.260> five<00:01:07.470> point<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.860> him<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.310> minutes

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a five point for him like two minutes

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
a five point for him like two minutes
and<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.119> seems<00:01:09.360> suspicious<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.020> my

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and it just all seems suspicious in my

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
and it just all seems suspicious in my
opinion<00:01:10.439> number<00:01:10.950> four<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.790> many<00:01:12.030> people<00:01:12.420> did

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
opinion number four how many people did

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
opinion number four how many people did
the<00:01:12.720> mole<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.500> let's<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.979> outside<00:01:14.400> I'm

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the mole use in let's go outside I'm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
the mole use in let's go outside I'm
happy<00:01:15.509> release<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.409> prizes<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.280> we

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
happy release one two prizes but we

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
happy release one two prizes but we
could<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.270> many<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.659> points<00:01:19.080> like

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
could have like so many more points like

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
could have like so many more points like
even<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:19.740> forty<00:01:20.130> points<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.790> always

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
even like forty points like we always

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.560 
even like forty points like we always

it would be appropriate for him to try

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.080 
it would be appropriate for him to try

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
surprised that Finn took the exemption

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.330

because he still wants to be in the game
and<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:19.700> pretty<00:02:19.970> sure<00:02:20.060> he's<00:02:20.299> not<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.600> mole
