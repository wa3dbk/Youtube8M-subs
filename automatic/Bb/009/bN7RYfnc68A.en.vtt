00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.380
 in this clip we demonstrate the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 touch functionality of a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.389
 display of an eos 70d 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.410
 which has a city screen like we do 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 know our phone capacitively and 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.920
 there are three situations in the camera 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.220
 which comes in handy 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.650
 we see the settings here 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 off the camera and so we can 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.960
 by touching it quickly look of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510
 hey 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 want another white balance put it well 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 clear 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.920
 no I had a nice movie doctor 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.930
 inside you just put it for a moment 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.100
 back on old white balance so money is 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.870
 also for the iso 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.120
 yes and that way should not be 200 but 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 three dog and 20 yes well quickly it can be like 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.180
 your camera with both hands web 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.520
 left and right and then you can do that with you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.219
 thumbs like on a kind of game console 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.570
 can do it really fast sir 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 it even more handy well we can 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 via this screen but we can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.460
 now things are also set by the minute 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.430
 Well here we have a menu address here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.859
 The four menu is your high ISO noise alexey 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.760
 below we tap and loved than weak 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.710
 standard 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.720
 fine so you can all that minute you can 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 and that goes really really fast and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.619
 easy 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 ultimately we can also have one 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.509
 liveview 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 who use touch functionality 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.420
 we'll see you two smurfs well it's it 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 is very simple 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 when you are simple intuitive it is for sure 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.729
 no you now want to focus on to ml 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.750
 or back on the head smurfs then 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.159
 that a matter of touch because 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 fencing it works it goes too 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.689
 super fast that is because the eos 70d 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 has a sensor with phase detection 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.420
 autofocus that goes very fast that is just 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.740
 just like the normal autofocus and he 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.479
 also has a sdm lens on it so 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.570
 focusing goes on smoothly again 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.799
 soundless and without jerks 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 nice here is that you can take a photo right away 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.299
 take it then you touch it now tap 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.799
 on caramel he states you have make the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.329
 photo 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.490
 you say well i think the white balance anyway 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.189
 not heaven okay then you see that here 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.920
 press the button and then you can 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.710
 we then choose white balance here ' and we 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.509
 Choose lamp light sees change here 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.860
 we don't like sitting even more 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.510
 under bios 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 fluorescent light one that is better fine this way 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.440
 well we made the pictures 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.170
 anyone who wants you those pictures too 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.470
 and then that is the third step 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.750
 in which you touch that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.070
 can use we can with the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.420
 scroll through the photos 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.020
 want to visit then there are the known ones 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.000
 Two-finger zooming back and grind 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.890
 push and we see here that I'm going 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.010
 neatly go with your finger chips 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.470
 it is it is just as active and sensitive 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.360
 like your phone so it's not 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.880
 that your hair should last or the no 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.830
 it's all going really fantastic and yes 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 that is therefore an added value 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.459
 to an SLR camera 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.140
 certainly because this is also a rotation 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.410
 office screen so you will 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.940
 extremely useful with setting 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.680
 the camera looking back at the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.180
 camera and with the touch shirt can be there 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 they also from the most madness I have difficult 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.360
 focus corners and take the photo 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.360
 so a wonderful functionality
