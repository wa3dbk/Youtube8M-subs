00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 in the medical post developed a technique 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.340
 surgical and innovative that allows to operate 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.280
 pathologies that mainly affect the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.080
 and protect themselves from 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.060
 legacy in the operative block of the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 hospital of santa maria in the body is 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 everything ready for the start of a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 surgical intervention that will return 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 sensitivity and ability 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.830
 the hands of dilma to china sobral is a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 a 52-year-old woman who works 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.360
 and about a year ago. 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.370
 forget about loss of sensitivity 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 tingling and pain is to get 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.360
 patients suffer in blocks in those 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 diseases that called neuropathies 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.110
 the following nodes 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 at the level of the hand we have two are nerds 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 main 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.039
 we have a nerve that calls one of them 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.030
 average and median for passing is emails 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.010
 and usually this nerve is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.170
 compressed at the channel level because of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.530
 a ligament is here in this 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.900
 position called carpal annulare ligament 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.159
 the other nerve is called ulnar fear 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.110
 that runs 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 therefore along the arm and that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.390
 is usually compressed at the level of the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.360
 because there is also here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 a ligament that causes many 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 times it is compressed and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 so this one lesson is a problem 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.000
 mechanic who resolves by cutting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.750
 ligaments that cause the compulsion of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 nerves 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.340
 we have developed a technique in which to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.409
 is a set of four instruments 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 very simple we could make the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.610
 operation through very 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.829
 small that both in the case of morning 11 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.140
 event increases by about one centimeter 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.759
 and in the case of what we see we do 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.490
 exactly the same thing we do here 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 a small incision through which we 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.610
 so let's insert one is an instrument 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 which will later enable us to cut 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 therefore the ligament or throughout the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 its extension with a sliding knife 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.610
 an appropriate knife and slides or long 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.530
 and access system 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 therefore it is a profession that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.700
 actually many movies are very 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.280
 fast and economical and has a large 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.110
 success rate at the time after 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.390
 ci intervention 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.160
 today that is the right arm is complete 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.770
 the images confirm that it was well 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.420
 happened that tonight she's going to 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.900
 can sleep rest because no longer 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.180
 you will feel the tingling and pain in your 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.000
 hands that are typical of the tunnel dulcino 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.160
 carpus and that wakes up a person half 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.780
 night the rain comes out when the patient is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.610
 the carpal canal itself 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.630
 the carpal tunnel the two are in the room 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.330
 operations 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.709
 immediate recovery in the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.840
 concerning the recovery of 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.640
 sensitivity and depends on the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.340
 time here already were sick was the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.410
 corruption and structural change is 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.690
 that the grandson has already been subjected to compression 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.580
 of the ulnar nerve and the tunnel syndrome 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.070
 are pathologies that affect 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.380
 especially adult women, is not 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.750
 known the specific cause but has 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.239
 relation to the other hormones and are 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.520
 work positions and 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.739
 use of mobile phones and computers 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.780
 in Portugal it is estimated that around 15 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.780
 thousand people suffered from this disease
