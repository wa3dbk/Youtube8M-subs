let's<00:01:11.070> grab<00:01:11.450> can't<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> too<00:01:13.140> far

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
let's grab can't see that it's too far

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.130 
let's grab can't see that it's too far
from<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> corner<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> there<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.390> no<00:01:15.540> 3d<00:01:15.810> here

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
from the corner so there is no 3d here

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.149 
from the corner so there is no 3d here
basically<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
basically it's just like you have a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
basically it's just like you have a
really<00:01:17.580> big<00:01:17.820> screen<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.509> problem<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
really big screen the problem is that a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
really big screen the problem is that a
lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> screens

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
lot of what you can see on the screens

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.850 
lot of what you can see on the screens
out<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> edges<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.750> can't<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.590> see

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
out on the edges so you can't really see

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
out on the edges so you can't really see
it<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.130> can't<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> map<00:01:23.909> very<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sense that at least on my machine I do a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
sense that at least on my machine I do a
fairly<00:01:38.729> powerful<00:01:38.880> machine<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.540> my

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
fairly powerful machine but on my

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.149 
fairly powerful machine but on my
machine<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> doesn't<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.409> affect<00:01:40.799> my

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
machine it doesn't really affect my

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.969 
machine it doesn't really affect my
framerate<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.850> any<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.649> like

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
framerate in any way at all it is like

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.530 
framerate in any way at all it is like
playing<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> big<00:01:44.579> screen<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> problem

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

play this game on an oculus rift because

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
play this game on an oculus rift because
that<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.610> very<00:02:02.820> very<00:02:03.450> frustrating<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that would be very very frustrating I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
that would be very very frustrating I
can't<00:02:04.170> even<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.469> easier<00:02:04.890> ok<00:02:05.130> last-hitting

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can't even make easier ok last-hitting

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.609 
can't even make easier ok last-hitting
is<00:02:06.210> incredibly<00:02:06.600> difficult<00:02:06.780> cuz<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.290> barely

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is incredibly difficult cuz I can barely

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.740 
is incredibly difficult cuz I can barely
tell<00:02:07.829> how<00:02:08.429> big<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.910> health<00:02:09.090> bars<00:02:09.360> are<00:02:09.629> on

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
tell how big the health bars are on

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
tell how big the health bars are on
these<00:02:09.869> guys<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.709> small

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.500 

I<00:02:13.940> think<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.420> there<00:02:16.080> ever<00:02:16.290> was<00:02:16.560> actual<00:02:17.510> 3d

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
I think that if there ever was actual 3d

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
I think that if there ever was actual 3d
support<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.950> once<00:02:20.100> we're<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
support and you know once we're on the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.520 
support and you know once we're on the
high-definition<00:02:20.910> consumer<00:02:21.600> version<00:02:21.930> then

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
high-definition consumer version then

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
high-definition consumer version then
yeah<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.640> might<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.820> some<00:02:24.150> benefit<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.540> this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
yeah there might be some benefit to this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.820 
yeah there might be some benefit to this
and<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:24.990> might<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:25.440> cool<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> have

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and it might be pretty cool to have

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
and it might be pretty cool to have
explosions<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:27.150> off<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.540> your<00:02:27.660> face<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
explosions going off in your face and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.990 
explosions going off in your face and
stuff<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.130> again<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.700> really

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
yes yes it will if you have something

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.420 
yes yes it will if you have something
like<00:02:49.140> four<00:02:49.410> facts<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.920> course<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.220> not

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
like four facts that of course is not

it's<00:02:52.830> not<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.190> back<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.610> can

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's not like for back so you can

it's not like for back so you can
emulate<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.390> can<00:02:54.540> force<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.080> work<00:02:55.290> but

emulate it you can force it to work but

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.520 
emulate it you can force it to work but
there<00:02:56.550> are<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.030> many<00:02:57.060> limitations<00:02:57.990> with

to do it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.680 
to do it
so<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.220> debated<00:04:02.790> on<00:04:02.820> whether<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.150> even<00:04:03.420> do

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
so I debated on whether not to even do

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.790 
so I debated on whether not to even do
this<00:04:03.840> for<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.050> for<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.230> while<00:04:04.350> because<00:04:04.500> not

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
this for you for a while because not

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.770 
this for you for a while because not
much<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.490> say<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:05.790> considering<00:04:06.540> how<00:04:06.630> many

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
much to say but considering how many

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.600 
much to say but considering how many
people<00:04:07.020> were<00:04:07.080> asking<00:04:07.440> about<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.740> in<00:04:07.860> forums<00:04:08.340> I

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
people were asking about it in forums I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.880 
people were asking about it in forums I
figured<00:04:09.390> it'd<00:04:09.660> be<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.930> good<00:04:10.080> idea<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.530> go<00:04:10.680> ahead

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
figured it'd be a good idea to go ahead

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.230 
figured it'd be a good idea to go ahead
and<00:04:11.010> do<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.340> so<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.520> people<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.850> finally<00:04:12.150> have

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
and do it so the people can finally have

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240
