million gp41 pure essence of course you
get<00:01:43.020> money<00:01:43.530> back<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> how<00:01:44.850> the

GE works so the price you bought the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.040 
GE works so the price you bought the
pure<00:01:48.810> sense<00:01:49.140> 4<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.190> 20<00:01:51.000> 3gp<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.800> means<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
pure sense 4 is 20 3gp which means that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.750 
pure sense 4 is 20 3gp which means that
this<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.860> current<00:01:57.950> offers<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.460> the

the highest bidder this won't work at

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.709 
the highest bidder this won't work at
pure<00:02:48.870> sense<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.459> such<00:02:51.150> small

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
pure sense because it is such small

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:57.080 
pure sense because it is such small
amounts<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:54.500> GP<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.949> it<00:02:56.219> would<00:02:56.459> affect<00:02:56.849> the

amounts of GP that it would affect the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.729 
amounts of GP that it would affect the
whole<00:02:57.209> profit<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> what<00:03:00.409> you<00:03:01.409> are<00:03:01.439> going

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
whole profit and so what you are going

changed<00:03:16.969> so<00:03:17.969> we<00:03:18.150> will<00:03:18.299> buy<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:19.139> we<00:03:19.919> will

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
changed so we will buy this and we will

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.439 
changed so we will buy this and we will
just<00:03:20.969> wait<00:03:21.840> until<00:03:22.970> everything<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.180> sold<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.139> us

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
just wait until everything is sold to us

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:33.199 
just wait until everything is sold to us
and<00:03:27.799> as<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.509> price<00:03:30.509> when<00:03:31.379> we<00:03:31.829> bought<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.459> was

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
and as the price when we bought it was

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:42.439 
and as the price when we bought it was
23<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.970> price<00:03:40.159> on<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.459> sales<00:03:41.819> market

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
23 that is the price on the sales market

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:49.670 
23 that is the price on the sales market
of<00:03:42.689> pure<00:03:43.500> sense<00:03:44.959> which<00:03:45.959> means<00:03:46.349> that<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:48.720> once

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
of pure sense which means that at once

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.369 
of pure sense which means that at once
again<00:03:49.949> if<00:03:50.159> it<00:03:50.340> would<00:03:50.489> have<00:03:50.609> been<00:03:50.729> a<00:03:50.970> 21<00:03:51.540> k<00:03:51.810> room

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
again if it would have been a 21 k room

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.069 
again if it would have been a 21 k room
long<00:03:52.620> term<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:53.069> example<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:54.299> could<00:03:54.509> just<00:03:54.750> go

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
long term for example you could just go

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.960 
long term for example you could just go
a<00:03:55.349> few<00:03:55.799> GPS<00:03:56.370> lower<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:58.049> be<00:03:58.229> the<00:03:58.470> lowest<00:03:58.970> seller

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
a few GPS lower to be the lowest seller

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.569 
a few GPS lower to be the lowest seller
and<00:04:00.439> once<00:04:01.439> again<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.829> won't<00:04:02.009> work<00:04:02.280> at

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
and once again it won't work at

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.969 
and once again it won't work at
Pearson's<00:04:03.209> because<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.930> such<00:04:04.229> a<00:04:04.530> low<00:04:04.709> cost

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
Pearson's because it is such a low cost

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:11.300 
Pearson's because it is such a low cost
for<00:04:05.669> one<00:04:06.120> item<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:09.229> so<00:04:10.229> when<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:10.799> have<00:04:11.099> bought

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
for one item and so when we have bought

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.909 
for one item and so when we have bought
all<00:04:11.639> of<00:04:11.699> the<00:04:12.150> pure<00:04:12.479> sense<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.439> will<00:04:13.769> get<00:04:15.650> 25<00:04:16.650> k

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
all of the pure sense you will get 25 k

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.270 
all of the pure sense you will get 25 k
we<00:04:17.549> will<00:04:17.699> sell<00:04:18.000> them<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.479> 20<00:04:18.989> 3gp<00:04:19.560> which<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.979> to

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
we will sell them for 20 3gp which is to

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.870 
we will sell them for 20 3gp which is to
GP<00:04:20.669> higher<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.870> will<00:04:21.930> give<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.469> a<00:04:22.500> 50k<00:04:23.340> profit

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
GP higher it will give you a 50k profit

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.980 
GP higher it will give you a 50k profit
it<00:04:24.389> is<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:25.020> but<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.699> making<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.570> small

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
it is not much but it is making a small

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.260 
it is not much but it is making a small
difference<00:04:28.199> while<00:04:28.949> you<00:04:29.460> are<00:04:29.580> playing<00:04:29.820> it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
difference while you are playing it

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.570 
difference while you are playing it
would

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
would

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:41.510 
would
probably<00:04:37.010> make<00:04:38.010> enough<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.330> trip<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
probably make enough for a trip to the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.370 
probably make enough for a trip to the
gut<00:04:41.850> worse<00:04:42.030> dungeon<00:04:42.510> for<00:04:42.720> example<00:04:43.200> or

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
gut worse dungeon for example or

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.910 
gut worse dungeon for example or
wherever<00:04:44.130> you're<00:04:44.550> going<00:04:45.000> for<00:04:45.920> preparations

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
wherever you're going for preparations

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.310 
wherever you're going for preparations
food<00:04:47.610> etc<00:04:48.500> while<00:04:49.500> you're<00:04:49.830> doing<00:04:50.070> other<00:04:50.670> things

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
food etc while you're doing other things

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.770 
food etc while you're doing other things
so<00:04:53.690> there<00:04:54.690> are<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:55.410> lot<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:56.240> possibilities<00:04:57.240> as

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
so there are a lot of possibilities as

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.370 
so there are a lot of possibilities as
you<00:04:57.990> can<00:04:58.170> buy<00:04:58.350> other<00:04:58.650> items<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.990> do<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.170> know

you can buy other items I do not know

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.430 
you can buy other items I do not know
which<00:05:01.830> ones<00:05:02.220> are<00:05:02.520> suitable<00:05:03.180> for

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
which ones are suitable for

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:13.700 
which ones are suitable for
merchandising<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.880> um<00:05:09.320> yeah<00:05:12.230> at<00:05:13.230> least<00:05:13.440> you

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
opportunity to get much more if it

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.230 
opportunity to get much more if it
wasn't<00:05:52.320> for<00:05:52.380> the<00:05:53.070> for<00:05:53.490> our<00:05:53.730> trade<00:05:54.720> limit
