00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
mean that makes sense if it's like a
hunter<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.189> elite<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.820> doesn't<00:01:45.060> really

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
hunter like an elite that doesn't really

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.260 
hunter like an elite that doesn't really
make<00:01:45.329> any<00:01:45.390> sense<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> me<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.350> whatever<00:01:47.280> enemy

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
make any sense to me or whatever enemy

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
make any sense to me or whatever enemy
we're<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.689> facing<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.140> Halo<00:01:49.320> 5<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
we're gonna be facing in Halo 5 and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
we're gonna be facing in Halo 5 and
that's<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> big<00:01:50.579> boss<00:01:50.909> guy<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.079> ko

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that's like a big boss guy a one at ko

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.539 
that's like a big boss guy a one at ko
doesn't<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.860> make<00:01:53.040> any<00:01:53.100> sense<00:01:53.460> unless

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
doesn't really make any sense unless

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.730 
doesn't really make any sense unless
it's<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> big<00:01:54.420> fucking<00:01:54.960> monster<00:01:55.409> type<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's like a big fucking monster type of

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410 
it's like a big fucking monster type of
guy<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> makes<00:01:56.369> sense<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.909> bring<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
guy then it makes sense now bring the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810

as<00:04:29.699> effective<00:04:30.180> as<00:04:30.599> they<00:04:30.960> keep<00:04:31.199> saying<00:04:31.439> it<00:04:31.590> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
as effective as they keep saying it to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.320 
as effective as they keep saying it to
be<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:31.979> hopefully<00:04:32.129> with<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.759> new<00:04:32.849> xbox<00:04:33.210> one

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
be but hopefully with the new xbox one

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.760 
be but hopefully with the new xbox one
better<00:04:33.629> technology<00:04:34.169> hopefully<00:04:34.590> they<00:04:34.710> can

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
better technology hopefully they can

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.260 
better technology hopefully they can
deliver<00:04:35.159> on<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.310> promise<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.909> mean<00:04:36.060> looking

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
deliver on that promise I mean looking

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.510
