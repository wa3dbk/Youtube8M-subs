00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.139
 ok let's start with our pattern 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.020
 for that we are going to draw a rectangle 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.410
 which will measure from here to close 3 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:23.259
 centimeters and down 5 centimeters and 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.099
 medium then we are going to form this 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.500
 rectangle ok from here to one side is 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.720
 half a centimeter that we are going to join with 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.530
 this part trying to make a small 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:41.180
 curve ok and then from this point to here 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.630
 they are 2 centimeters 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.500
 we put half a centimeter or whether it is 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.140
 here here an inch and a half to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.350
 do this line we go down from here towards 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.930
 down three centimeters and we extend 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.770
 our lines until more happens or 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:04.640
 less for the two centimeters ok 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.630
 then the small rectangle measures two 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.360
 by two and a half centimeters what is of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.400
 up here we only form our 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.460
 curve 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.920
 and that's all we would do in this 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 stroke remember that if you do not want to do 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.230
 all this procedure because they can 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.230
 download directly from my blog 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 where they print it illicit ok 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.960
 Well, here I already have my arms 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.990
 clipping and what we are going to do is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.780
 simply pass it on our all fabric 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.729
 that this double we are going to cut 4 feet 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.119
 well ok and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.490
 sew on this part more or less we are going to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.670
 sew a centimeter so that it fits 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.060
 right to our object wrist I already 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.550
 I met and it was not in a centimeter anymore or 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.780
 minus eight millimeters a little bit less in 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.380
 half centimeter 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.600
 that's what we have left and so we have the other 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.319
 part of it we do the same, here I already passed 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.959
 another seam here that is like this view 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.290
 they can do it or not because it also remains 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.220
 very good so simple and short ok 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 what's next is to put these two 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.780
 together like this and we're going to sew 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.099
 on this side also more or less to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.750
 half an inch ok for the two not with 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:49.650
 just for one side ok because I already crazy if 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.040
 this side and the other side ccoo yes but 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.990
 only up to half ok 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 we turn 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.660
 I made a small ornament for him here 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.470
 the denim skirt that we already made 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.360
 pure sewing to simulate closure ok 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.970
 remember that these are pure views and 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.740
 they may not do it simply have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.500
 known this side and this side and remains 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.480
 all right 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.090
 Well now that we have it that way 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.090
 let's bend half a centimeter 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.600
 more or less 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.629
 and we are going to pass a good sewing I already 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:39.139
 that here at the top and is and 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.450
 and just need to know by the part of 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:46.000
 down 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:49.980
 of course that for a serious and we are going to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.830
 sew about one centimeter 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.880
 ok then we have that left in the part of 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.550
 back would not fit a Velcro or a 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.110
 button or a requirement what you have for 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.299
 can say ok and we have this long what 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.580
 that if you do them long what 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.910
 can cut or fold 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:20.670
 whose father is also but cut 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.670
 from where the shore was known 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.790
 I will be like that 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.470
 and that's all right now I show you 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.550
 with its accessories and well accommodated ok 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.550
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.990
 and 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.880

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.870
