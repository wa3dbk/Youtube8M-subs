strong when we take it back to New

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.830 
strong when we take it back to New
Zealand<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:25.460> Iran<00:02:26.240> that's<00:02:26.510> here's<00:02:26.750> a

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
Zealand but I think Iran that's here's a

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.980 
Zealand but I think Iran that's here's a
is<00:02:27.590> fronting<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.130> for<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.490> team<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.330> think

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
is fronting up for the team and I think

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.690 
is fronting up for the team and I think
that's<00:02:30.140> been<00:02:30.320> found<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.890> past<00:02:31.130> where<00:02:31.460> some

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that's been found in the past where some

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.790 
that's been found in the past where some
players<00:02:31.910> have<00:02:32.000> come<00:02:32.270> over<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.620> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
players have come over and it's more of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.790 
players have come over and it's more of
a<00:02:33.950> retirement<00:02:34.430> kind<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.910> scheme<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:36.350> don't

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
a retirement kind of scheme and I don't

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.560 
a retirement kind of scheme and I don't
think<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.190> don't<00:02:37.430> think<00:02:37.610> that's<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.060> same<00:02:38.270> for

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
think I don't think that's the same for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.840 
think I don't think that's the same for
that<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.140> guys<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.320> are<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:39.590> today

gratitude impact drive and leadership

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.260 
gratitude impact drive and leadership
but<00:02:49.520> at<00:02:49.670> what<00:02:49.850> cost<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.600> your<00:02:51.080> own

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
but at what cost to your own

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.800 
but at what cost to your own
the<00:02:53.080> whole<00:02:53.290> idea<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:54.180> bringing<00:02:55.180> these<00:02:55.480> players

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the whole idea of bringing these players

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.170 
the whole idea of bringing these players
means<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:57.280> know<00:02:57.400> there's<00:02:57.880> going<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
means that you know there's going to be

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.060 
means that you know there's going to be
guys<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.750> Jamie<00:02:59.290> Roberts<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.860> going<00:03:00.010> to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
guys like a Jamie Roberts is going to

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.010 
guys like a Jamie Roberts is going to
learn<00:03:00.220> off<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.580> being<00:03:00.790> Blair<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.330> then<00:03:01.450> when

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
learn off it being Blair and then when

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.250 
learn off it being Blair and then when
he's<00:03:02.140> when<00:03:02.530> he's<00:03:03.000> seemed<00:03:04.000> Dean<00:03:04.270> for<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> better

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
he's when he's seemed Dean for a better

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.800 
he's when he's seemed Dean for a better
player<00:03:05.590> than<00:03:05.710> him<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.010> club<00:03:06.430> rugby<00:03:06.610> well<00:03:07.600> then

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
player than him and club rugby well then

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.540 
player than him and club rugby well then
surely<00:03:08.230> that's<00:03:08.350> got<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.800> better<00:03:08.890> is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
surely that's got to be a better is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.790 
surely that's got to be a better is
going<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> be<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.150> step<00:03:10.360> up<00:03:10.540> towards<00:03:10.990> making

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
going to be the step up towards making

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.040 
going to be the step up towards making
the<00:03:12.040> Welsh<00:03:12.250> team<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.610> going<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.790> be<00:03:12.970> or<00:03:13.540> you

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
the Welsh team is going to be or you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.420 
the Welsh team is going to be or you
know<00:03:14.140> playing<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> while<00:03:14.740> is<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
know playing for a while is going to be

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.430 
know playing for a while is going to be
an<00:03:15.790> easier<00:03:16.090> step<00:03:16.360> for<00:03:16.600> them<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.230> think<00:03:17.920> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
an easier step for them and I think it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.930 
an easier step for them and I think it's
you<00:03:20.440> know<00:03:20.560> if<00:03:20.770> if<00:03:21.100> you're<00:03:21.280> not<00:03:21.370> good<00:03:21.610> enough<00:03:21.640> to

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
New Zealand and and meant that I

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.650 
New Zealand and and meant that I
suddenly<00:03:35.710> became<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.130> bench<00:03:36.610> player<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.600> that
