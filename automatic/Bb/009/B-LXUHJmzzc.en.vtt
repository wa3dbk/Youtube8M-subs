fusing hydrogen to make helium

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.450

eventually<00:01:03.719> though<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.470> star<00:01:04.769> runs<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.400> of

eventually though the star runs out of
hydrogen<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.210> begins<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> fuse<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.710> stocks<00:01:07.979> of

so<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.540> works<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.229> always<00:01:13.380> works

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
so the way it works and it always works

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
so the way it works and it always works
this<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> contracts<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
this way is that it contracts and it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
this way is that it contracts and it
gets<00:01:16.080> hotter<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.520> find<00:01:17.759> something

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
gets hotter and if it can find something

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
gets hotter and if it can find something
new<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.390> burn<00:01:18.689> whether<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> kitchen

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.339 
of the road it's it's sort of the
nuclear<00:02:19.180> turnip<00:02:19.780> out<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.080> which<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.319> just

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
nuclear turnip out of which you just

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.850 
nuclear turnip out of which you just
cannot<00:02:21.160> squeeze<00:02:21.629> any<00:02:22.629> more<00:02:22.840> it's<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.620> end<00:02:23.739> of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
cannot squeeze any more it's the end of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
cannot squeeze any more it's the end of
the<00:02:23.980> game<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.459> star<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> has<00:02:25.329> relied<00:02:25.690> on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
the game a star that has relied on

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.020 
the game a star that has relied on
fusion<00:02:26.260> has<00:02:27.010> come<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> point<00:02:27.700> where<00:02:27.970> it

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
fusion has come to the point where it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.880 
fusion has come to the point where it
has<00:02:28.150> nothing<00:02:28.510> more<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> spend<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.560> star<00:02:29.769> is

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
has nothing more to spend the star is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.280 
has nothing more to spend the star is
suddenly<00:02:30.730> caught<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.329> disaster<00:02:32.079> there's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
suddenly caught in a disaster there's

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.350 
suddenly caught in a disaster there's
radiation<00:02:32.650> going<00:02:33.160> out<00:02:33.310> from<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.670> outside<00:02:34.090> but

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
radiation going out from the outside but

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.920 
radiation going out from the outside but
deep<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> inside<00:02:35.260> there's<00:02:36.209> no<00:02:37.209> more<00:02:37.510> fuel

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
deep in the inside there's no more fuel

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.430 
deep in the inside there's no more fuel
iron<00:02:38.680> can't<00:02:39.220> fuel<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.879> stellar<00:02:40.239> furnace<00:02:40.720> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
iron can't fuel the stellar furnace and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.180 
iron can't fuel the stellar furnace and
so<00:02:41.829> when<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> star<00:02:42.970> builds<00:02:43.390> up<00:02:43.510> too<00:02:43.720> much<00:02:43.840> iron

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
so when a star builds up too much iron

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.390 
so when a star builds up too much iron
it<00:02:45.190> dies<00:02:45.780> liqueur<00:02:46.780> collapses<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.590> bounces<00:02:48.099> and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it dies liqueur collapses it bounces and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.220 
it dies liqueur collapses it bounces and
it<00:02:48.489> begins<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.849> move<00:02:49.060> out<00:02:49.269> first<00:02:49.629> slowly<00:02:50.019> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
it begins to move out first slowly and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.350 
it begins to move out first slowly and
then<00:02:50.290> faster<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.040> faster<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.819> sends<00:02:52.299> a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
then faster and faster and that sends a

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.390 
then faster and faster and that sends a
very<00:02:52.540> sharp<00:02:52.750> wave<00:02:53.200> back<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:53.890> through<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
very sharp wave back out through the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550 
very sharp wave back out through the
start<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.120> now<00:02:55.329> what<00:02:55.660> was<00:02:55.810> falling<00:02:56.170> down<00:02:56.350> is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
start and now what was falling down is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.800 
start and now what was falling down is
going<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.100> whole<00:02:57.220> things<00:02:57.489> blowing<00:02:57.850> up

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.470

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
and you made supernova the supernova

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.509 
and you made supernova the supernova

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
explosion it can be as bright as four
