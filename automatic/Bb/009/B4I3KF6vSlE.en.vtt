strip<00:00:03.920> tool<00:00:04.130> is<00:00:04.339> a<00:00:04.370> practice<00:00:04.879> that<00:00:04.910> many

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
strip tool is a practice that many

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.420 
strip tool is a practice that many
farmers<00:00:05.870> are<00:00:06.049> now<00:00:06.200> using<00:00:06.529> across<00:00:06.919> the<00:00:07.069> country

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.430 
farmers are now using across the country

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.070 
farmers are now using across the country
and<00:00:07.549> today<00:00:07.879> we<00:00:08.029> wanted<00:00:08.270> to<00:00:08.300> talk<00:00:08.480> about<00:00:08.780> why

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
and today we wanted to talk about why

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.510 
and today we wanted to talk about why
and<00:00:09.470> get<00:00:09.680> into<00:00:09.830> some<00:00:09.950> more<00:00:10.130> of<00:00:10.340> the<00:00:10.430> specifics

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
and get into some more of the specifics

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.460 
and get into some more of the specifics
because<00:00:11.180> this<00:00:11.420> is<00:00:11.570> something<00:00:11.720> we're<00:00:12.050> doing<00:00:12.350> on

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
because this is something we're doing on

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.350 
because this is something we're doing on
some<00:00:12.710> of<00:00:12.830> our<00:00:13.040> acres<00:00:13.460> on<00:00:13.640> our<00:00:13.790> farm<00:00:14.030> as<00:00:14.210> well

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
some of our acres on our farm as well

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.329 
some of our acres on our farm as well
now<00:00:14.600> before<00:00:15.290> we<00:00:15.380> talk<00:00:15.530> about<00:00:15.650> strip<00:00:15.920> kill<00:00:16.100> too

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:16.339 
now before we talk about strip kill too

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.609 
now before we talk about strip kill too
I<00:00:16.519> know<00:00:16.609> that<00:00:17.179> you<00:00:17.359> may<00:00:17.539> be<00:00:17.599> a<00:00:17.720> no<00:00:17.990> tiller<00:00:18.289> you

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
I know that you may be a no tiller you

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.859 
I know that you may be a no tiller you
may<00:00:18.800> be<00:00:18.859> a<00:00:19.339> conventional<00:00:20.329> tiller<00:00:20.539> you<00:00:20.749> know

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
may be a conventional tiller you know

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.540 
may be a conventional tiller you know
what<00:00:21.079> we<00:00:21.320> believe<00:00:21.619> that<00:00:21.650> all<00:00:21.890> tillage

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
what we believe that all tillage

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.609 
what we believe that all tillage
practices<00:00:22.579> can<00:00:23.359> work<00:00:23.599> but<00:00:24.079> they<00:00:24.199> all<00:00:24.349> have<00:00:24.589> a

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
practices can work but they all have a

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.589 
practices can work but they all have a
fit<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.159> different<00:00:25.490> situations<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.300> we<00:00:26.390> want

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
fit in different situations so we want

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.819 
fit in different situations so we want
to<00:00:26.689> explain<00:00:26.929> that<00:00:26.989> a<00:00:27.169> little<00:00:27.380> bit<00:00:27.499> as<00:00:27.650> well

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:27.829 
to explain that a little bit as well

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.499 
to explain that a little bit as well
they<00:00:28.039> all<00:00:28.159> have<00:00:28.369> strengths<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:28.999> weaknesses<00:00:29.449> I

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
they all have strengths and weaknesses I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.390 
they all have strengths and weaknesses I
mean<00:00:29.810> there's<00:00:29.989> no<00:00:30.169> perfect<00:00:30.560> system<00:00:30.980> out<00:00:31.279> there

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
mean there's no perfect system out there

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.889 
mean there's no perfect system out there
though<00:00:31.579> as<00:00:31.669> everybody<00:00:32.119> would<00:00:32.300> be<00:00:32.329> doing<00:00:32.480> it

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
though as everybody would be doing it

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.479 
though as everybody would be doing it
right<00:00:33.109> so<00:00:33.410> we<00:00:33.590> wanted<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:33.890> talk<00:00:34.070> about<00:00:34.219> these

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
right so we wanted to talk about these

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.790 
right so we wanted to talk about these
advantages<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.629> disadvantages<00:00:36.350> of<00:00:36.410> strip

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
advantages and disadvantages of strip

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.170 
advantages and disadvantages of strip
tail<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.219> you<00:00:37.280> can<00:00:37.430> consider<00:00:37.789> whether<00:00:38.059> it's

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
tail so you can consider whether it's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.209 
tail so you can consider whether it's
worth<00:00:38.480> using<00:00:38.780> on<00:00:39.079> your<00:00:39.109> farm<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:39.739> for<00:00:40.010> our

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
worth using on your farm now for our

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.430 
worth using on your farm now for our
farm<00:00:40.640> we've<00:00:40.850> got<00:00:41.090> some<00:00:41.329> Rolly<00:00:41.629> hills<00:00:42.050> as<00:00:42.320> you

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
farm we've got some Rolly hills as you

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.720 
farm we've got some Rolly hills as you
can<00:00:42.590> probably<00:00:42.829> see<00:00:43.100> in<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:43.519> particular

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
can probably see in this particular

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.669 
can probably see in this particular
field<00:00:44.239> that<00:00:44.390> we've<00:00:44.510> been<00:00:44.629> in<00:00:44.809> today<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.410> when

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
field that we've been in today and when

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.410 
field that we've been in today and when
you've<00:00:45.769> got<00:00:45.949> those<00:00:46.160> rolly<00:00:46.489> hills<00:00:46.789> erosion

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
you've got those rolly hills erosion

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.599 
you've got those rolly hills erosion
becomes<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.960> big<00:00:48.230> concern<00:00:48.679> for<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.370> it

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
becomes a big concern for you so it

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.430 
becomes a big concern for you so it
feels<00:00:49.760> like<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.660> don't<00:00:50.780> really<00:00:50.989> like<00:00:51.289> to

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
feels like this we don't really like to

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.139 
feels like this we don't really like to
do<00:00:51.559> conventional<00:00:51.949> tillage<00:00:52.370> just<00:00:52.699> because<00:00:53.000> our

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
do conventional tillage just because our

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.509 
do conventional tillage just because our
potential<00:00:53.719> for<00:00:53.929> erosion<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.769> big<00:00:55.010> deal<00:00:55.219> now

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
potential for erosion is a big deal now

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.549 
potential for erosion is a big deal now
we<00:00:55.579> went<00:00:56.089> to<00:00:56.210> no-till<00:00:56.660> for<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.019> number<00:00:57.289> of<00:00:57.410> years

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
we went to no-till for a number of years

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.680 
we went to no-till for a number of years
in<00:00:57.949> no-till<00:00:58.309> has<00:00:58.550> great<00:00:58.999> advantages

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
in no-till has great advantages

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.180 
in no-till has great advantages
especially<00:01:00.019> with<00:01:00.589> reducing<00:01:01.070> erosion

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
especially with reducing erosion

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.220 
especially with reducing erosion
potential<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.239> we<00:01:02.329> looked<00:01:02.510> at<00:01:02.660> strip<00:01:02.899> till<00:01:03.079> we

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
potential but we looked at strip till we

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.450 
potential but we looked at strip till we
thought<00:01:03.410> you<00:01:03.559> know<00:01:03.589> is<00:01:03.859> this<00:01:04.070> going<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.309> be<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
thought you know is this going to be a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.890 
thought you know is this going to be a
problem<00:01:04.729> for<00:01:04.939> stricter<00:01:05.479> when<00:01:05.630> we're<00:01:05.780> doing

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
problem for stricter when we're doing

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.990 
problem for stricter when we're doing
you<00:01:06.290> know<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.740> seven<00:01:07.250> or<00:01:07.340> eight<00:01:07.490> inch<00:01:07.729> wide

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
you know just a seven or eight inch wide

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.929 
you know just a seven or eight inch wide
band<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.439> going<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:09.979> enough<00:01:10.009> tillage

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
band is that going to be enough tillage

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.550 
band is that going to be enough tillage
out<00:01:11.119> there<00:01:11.329> to<00:01:11.540> really<00:01:11.840> significantly

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
out there to really significantly

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.380 
out there to really significantly
increase<00:01:12.950> our<00:01:13.159> well<00:01:13.430> once<00:01:13.729> again<00:01:13.850> like<00:01:14.150> Darren

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
increase our well once again like Darren

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.230 
increase our well once again like Darren
said<00:01:14.570> there<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.869> no<00:01:15.020> perfect<00:01:15.259> system<00:01:15.530> so

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
said there is no perfect system so

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.700 
said there is no perfect system so
no-till<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.540> going<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:17.930> mean<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.170> least

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
no-till is going to mean the least

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.590 
no-till is going to mean the least
amount<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.070> erosion<00:01:19.189> in<00:01:19.579> a<00:01:19.640> field<00:01:19.880> if<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.390> have

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
amount of erosion in a field if you have

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.149 
amount of erosion in a field if you have
strip<00:01:20.899> tool<00:01:21.079> you're<00:01:21.259> going<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.439> have<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.770> little

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
strip tool you're going to have a little

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.490 
strip tool you're going to have a little
bit<00:01:22.310> more<00:01:22.460> erosion<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.420> what<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:23.840> gain<00:01:24.079> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
bit more erosion but what you gain the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.260 
bit more erosion but what you gain the
two<00:01:24.649> big<00:01:24.890> things<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.430> gain<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.970> you've

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
two big things that you gain is you've

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.780 
two big things that you gain is you've
got<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.479> warmer<00:01:27.229> soil<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.829> warmer<00:01:28.220> seed<00:01:28.579> bed

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
got a warmer soil a warmer seed bed

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.370 
got a warmer soil a warmer seed bed
right<00:01:29.149> in<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.509> strip<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.320> other

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
right in that strip and then the other

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.350 
right in that strip and then the other
thing<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.009> number<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.549> reason<00:01:31.790> why<00:01:32.090> we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
thing the number one reason why we

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.940 
thing the number one reason why we
wanted<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.689> do<00:01:32.869> strip<00:01:33.110> deal<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.469> we<00:01:33.829> could

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
wanted to do strip deal is we could

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.709 
wanted to do strip deal is we could
place<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.369> fertilizer<00:01:34.820> better<00:01:35.119> because<00:01:35.540> I

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
place the fertilizer better because I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.539 
place the fertilizer better because I
just<00:01:36.259> do<00:01:36.469> not<00:01:36.500> want<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:37.280> all<00:01:37.430> our

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
just do not want to have all our

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.359 
just do not want to have all our
fertility<00:01:38.240> either<00:01:38.689> broadcast<00:01:39.560> on<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.920> top<00:01:40.130> or

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
fertility either broadcast on the top or

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.340 
fertility either broadcast on the top or
banded<00:01:41.030> right<00:01:41.240> with<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.509> seed<00:01:41.780> or<00:01:42.049> anything

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
banded right with the seed or anything

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.569 
banded right with the seed or anything
like<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:43.070> isn't<00:01:43.250> going<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.520> cut

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
like that that just isn't going to cut

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.160 
like that that just isn't going to cut
it<00:01:43.909> when<00:01:44.030> we're<00:01:44.210> trying<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.479> go<00:01:44.630> for<00:01:44.810> big-time

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
it when we're trying to go for big-time

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.170 
it when we're trying to go for big-time
yields<00:01:45.649> we're<00:01:45.950> trying<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.399> build<00:01:46.729> up<00:01:46.969> our

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
yields we're trying to build up our

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.510 
yields we're trying to build up our
entire<00:01:47.509> soil<00:01:47.899> profile<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> couple

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
entire soil profile going down a couple

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.130 
entire soil profile going down a couple
feet<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.030> ground<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:50.869> going<00:01:51.049> to

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
feet in the ground and it's going to

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.959 
feet in the ground and it's going to
start<00:01:51.500> by<00:01:51.710> getting<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.310> strip<00:01:52.729> till

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
start by getting that strip till

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.050 
start by getting that strip till
fertilizer<00:01:53.689> down<00:01:54.110> 10<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.890> 12<00:01:55.189> inches<00:01:55.369> deep<00:01:55.820> so

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
fertilizer down 10 to 12 inches deep so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.450 
fertilizer down 10 to 12 inches deep so
basically<00:01:56.630> we're<00:01:56.960> leading<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.829> rut<00:01:58.159> down<00:01:58.430> a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
basically we're leading that rut down a

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.580 
basically we're leading that rut down a
little<00:01:58.759> bit<00:01:58.939> deeper<00:01:59.299> in<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.509> soil<00:01:59.750> we<00:02:00.140> know<00:02:00.380> at

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
little bit deeper in the soil we know at

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.170 
little bit deeper in the soil we know at
10<00:02:00.799> or<00:02:00.890> 12<00:02:01.100> inches<00:02:01.369> deep<00:02:01.579> we've<00:02:01.789> got<00:02:01.969> more

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
10 or 12 inches deep we've got more

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.539 
10 or 12 inches deep we've got more
moisture<00:02:02.689> down<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:03.200> more<00:02:03.829> consistent

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
moisture down there more consistent

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.670 
moisture down there more consistent
moisture<00:02:04.670> down<00:02:05.119> there<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:05.570> when<00:02:05.899> we<00:02:06.049> have<00:02:06.229> dry

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
moisture down there so when we have dry

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.710 
moisture down there so when we have dry
spells<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> summertime<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.330> often

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
spells in the summertime like we often

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.719 
spells in the summertime like we often
do<00:02:08.899> we've<00:02:09.289> got<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.769> moisture<00:02:10.190> down<00:02:10.340> there<00:02:10.580> if

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
do we've got that moisture down there if

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.699 
do we've got that moisture down there if
we<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:10.970> fertility<00:02:11.330> down<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.989> deep<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.470> well

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
we have fertility down that deep as well

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.660 
we have fertility down that deep as well
now<00:02:13.340> we

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
now we

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
now we
can<00:02:13.819> completely<00:02:14.240> feed<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.720> plant<00:02:14.930> well<00:02:15.440> I'm

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
can completely feed that plant well I'm

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.260 
can completely feed that plant well I'm
guess<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.280> know<00:02:16.400> how<00:02:16.550> wide<00:02:16.819> does<00:02:17.090> that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
guess a you know how wide does that

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.600 
guess a you know how wide does that
strip<00:02:17.569> need<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.950> needs<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.400> have<00:02:19.580> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
strip need to be and it needs to have a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.339 
strip need to be and it needs to have a
little<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> width<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.810> because<00:02:21.140> not

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
little bit of width to it because not

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.870 
little bit of width to it because not
only<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:21.830> have<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.040> get<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.550> row

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
only do you have to get that row

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.750 
only do you have to get that row
somewhere<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.989> your<00:02:24.290> strip<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.310> also<00:02:25.580> need<00:02:25.730> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
somewhere in your strip you also need to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.070 
somewhere in your strip you also need to
have<00:02:25.849> those<00:02:26.060> gauge<00:02:26.330> wheels<00:02:26.599> running<00:02:26.810> through

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
have those gauge wheels running through

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.780 
have those gauge wheels running through
there<00:02:27.230> too<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.739> a<00:02:27.800> nice<00:02:28.010> consistent

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
there too so they have a nice consistent

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.520 
there too so they have a nice consistent
seating<00:02:29.209> depth<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.599> you've<00:02:29.750> got<00:02:29.989> gauge<00:02:30.230> wheels

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530

of a sudden now instead of maybe a nice
tilty<00:02:35.420> soil<00:02:35.720> you've<00:02:35.959> got<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> more<00:02:36.650> firm<00:02:36.980> soil

to bounce up over that your seating
depth<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.769> going<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.130> uneven<00:02:46.610> now<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
depth is going to be uneven now the

we want the black strip in the spring so
it<00:02:51.560> warms<00:02:51.860> up<00:02:52.280> how<00:02:52.700> much<00:02:52.910> corn<00:02:53.299> stocks<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
it warms up how much corn stocks and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.110 
it warms up how much corn stocks and
other<00:02:54.230> residue<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.160> blow<00:02:55.430> back<00:02:55.730> over

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
other residue is going to blow back over

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.400 
other residue is going to blow back over
that<00:02:56.269> some<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.660> stuff<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.959> going<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.260> blow

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that some of the stuff is going to blow

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.020 
that some of the stuff is going to blow
back<00:02:57.620> over<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.220> if<00:02:58.430> you're<00:02:58.610> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> try<00:02:59.000> to

back over so if you're going to try to
just<00:02:59.299> go<00:02:59.420> out<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.780> spring<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.170> do<00:03:00.260> nothing

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
just go out in the spring and do nothing

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.530 
just go out in the spring and do nothing
other<00:03:00.680> than<00:03:00.890> plant<00:03:01.190> that's<00:03:01.700> fine<00:03:02.030> but<00:03:02.480> you

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
other than plant that's fine but you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.120 
other than plant that's fine but you
want<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.900> have<00:03:03.049> some<00:03:03.319> kind<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.590> row<00:03:03.799> cleaners

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
want to have some kind of row cleaners

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.430 
want to have some kind of row cleaners
to<00:03:04.910> get<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.390> little<00:03:05.660> bit<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.900> residue<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
to get that little bit of residue that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.680 
to get that little bit of residue that
might<00:03:06.680> blow<00:03:06.920> back<00:03:07.130> in<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.150> get<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.450> off<00:03:08.660> of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
might blow back in and get that off of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.960 
might blow back in and get that off of
there<00:03:08.870> now<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.319> lot<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:09.920> farmers<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.549> our<00:03:10.700> region

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
there now a lot of farmers in our region

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.850 
there now a lot of farmers in our region
where<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.540> are<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> little<00:03:11.930> bit<00:03:12.110> colder<00:03:12.500> up<00:03:12.530> in

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
where we are a little bit colder up in

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.650 
where we are a little bit colder up in
South<00:03:13.100> Dakota<00:03:13.280> into<00:03:13.819> North<00:03:14.150> Dakota<00:03:14.450> Minnesota

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
South Dakota into North Dakota Minnesota

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.990 
South Dakota into North Dakota Minnesota
in<00:03:15.170> those<00:03:15.380> areas<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.010> lot<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.489> guys<00:03:16.640> they

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
in those areas a lot of the guys they

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.580 
in those areas a lot of the guys they
just<00:03:17.030> aren't<00:03:17.480> real<00:03:17.720> big<00:03:17.989> on<00:03:18.140> strip<00:03:18.440> too

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
just aren't real big on strip too

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.530 
just aren't real big on strip too
because<00:03:18.890> they<00:03:19.070> say<00:03:19.280> well<00:03:19.519> it's<00:03:19.910> not<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.450> to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
because they say well it's not going to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.569 
because they say well it's not going to
warm<00:03:20.780> my<00:03:20.989> soil<00:03:21.260> up<00:03:21.500> enough<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.280> thing<00:03:22.549> is

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
warm my soil up enough the thing is

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.060 
warm my soil up enough the thing is
though<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.840> going<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.260> warm<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.620> up<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.829> lot

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
though it is going to warm it up a lot

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.160 
though it is going to warm it up a lot
more<00:03:25.250> than<00:03:25.459> no-till<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.299> does<00:03:26.570> help<00:03:26.930> in

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
more than no-till and it does help in

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.199 
more than no-till and it does help in
terms<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.680> reducing<00:03:28.340> erosion<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:29.000> you've<00:03:29.180> got

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
terms of reducing erosion so you've got

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.120 
terms of reducing erosion so you've got
to<00:03:29.570> look<00:03:29.720> at<00:03:29.900> both<00:03:30.079> sides<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> thing<00:03:30.920> and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
to look at both sides of the thing and

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.039 
to look at both sides of the thing and
we<00:03:31.489> also<00:03:31.640> find<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.090> lot<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.359> guys<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.510> they'll

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
we also find a lot of guys that they'll

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.990 
we also find a lot of guys that they'll
strip<00:03:33.350> till<00:03:33.590> for<00:03:34.070> soybeans<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:34.910> other

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
strip till for soybeans so in other

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.340 
strip till for soybeans so in other
words<00:03:35.239> they'll<00:03:35.420> go<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.810> strip<00:03:35.989> till<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
words they'll go out and strip till in

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.750 
words they'll go out and strip till in
their<00:03:36.530> corn<00:03:36.890> then<00:03:37.130> they'll<00:03:37.280> plant<00:03:37.489> soybeans

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
their corn then they'll plant soybeans

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.970 
their corn then they'll plant soybeans
but<00:03:38.299> they<00:03:38.420> really<00:03:38.690> worried<00:03:39.049> about<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.560> corn

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
but they really worried about that corn

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.199 
but they really worried about that corn
they<00:03:40.220> don't<00:03:40.400> want<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.609> strip<00:03:40.820> till<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.180> the

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
they don't want to strip till in the

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.390 
they don't want to strip till in the
soybean<00:03:41.660> ground<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.200> much<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.590> put<00:03:42.859> that<00:03:43.040> corn

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
soybean ground so much and put that corn

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.860 
soybean ground so much and put that corn
out<00:03:43.609> there<00:03:43.850> because<00:03:44.060> they're<00:03:44.329> just<00:03:44.570> so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
out there because they're just so

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.259 
out there because they're just so
concerned<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.859> boy<00:03:46.310> that<00:03:46.340> corn<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.030> isn't

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
concerned that boy that corn just isn't

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.150 
concerned that boy that corn just isn't
going<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.420> emerge<00:03:47.750> fast<00:03:48.230> enough<00:03:48.590> we've<00:03:48.859> got<00:03:49.040> to

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
going to emerge fast enough we've got to

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.039 
going to emerge fast enough we've got to
do<00:03:49.280> more<00:03:49.489> aggressive<00:03:50.000> tillage<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.540> make<00:03:50.720> sure

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
do more aggressive tillage to make sure

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.020 
do more aggressive tillage to make sure
that<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:51.350> ground<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.859> black<00:03:52.250> going<00:03:52.880> into

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
that that ground is black going into

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.849

do<00:04:13.459> have<00:04:13.850> enough<00:04:14.180> fertilizer<00:04:14.389> out<00:04:14.900> there<00:04:15.109> for

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
do have enough fertilizer out there for

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.620 
do have enough fertilizer out there for
their<00:04:15.410> soybeans<00:04:15.829> oh<00:04:16.010> god<00:04:16.310> don't<00:04:16.609> go<00:04:16.850> on<00:04:17.299> at

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
their soybeans oh god don't go on at

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.000 
their soybeans oh god don't go on at
well<00:04:17.900> I'm<00:04:18.049> just<00:04:18.200> saying<00:04:18.320> there<00:04:18.680> are<00:04:18.769> some

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
well I'm just saying there are some

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.710 
well I'm just saying there are some
people<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.310> probably<00:04:19.579> do<00:04:20.030> but<00:04:20.239> on<00:04:20.359> average

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
people that probably do but on average

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.020 
people that probably do but on average
what<00:04:21.590> we<00:04:21.709> find<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.130> most<00:04:22.340> farmers<00:04:22.669> don't<00:04:22.820> have

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
what we find is most farmers don't have

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.339 
what we find is most farmers don't have
enough<00:04:23.270> for<00:04:23.419> two<00:04:23.539> years<00:04:23.570> they<00:04:24.020> only<00:04:24.140> have

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
enough for two years they only have

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.110 
enough for two years they only have
enough<00:04:24.530> for<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.710> one<00:04:24.979> crop<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.550> on<00:04:25.669> our<00:04:25.820> farm

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
enough for the one crop so on our farm

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.490 
enough for the one crop so on our farm
for<00:04:26.390> example<00:04:26.810> we<00:04:26.990> are

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
for example we are

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.410 
for example we are
doing<00:04:27.740> strip<00:04:27.980> tail<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.310> front<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.580> corn<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.060> in

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
doing strip tail in front of corn and in

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.360 
doing strip tail in front of corn and in
front<00:04:29.690> of<00:04:29.780> soybeans<00:04:30.230> this<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.800> in<00:04:30.920> 30<00:04:31.160> inch

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
front of soybeans this is in 30 inch

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.560 
front of soybeans this is in 30 inch
rows<00:04:31.610> now<00:04:31.850> if<00:04:31.910> you're<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> different<00:04:32.330> row

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
rows now if you're in a different row

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.790 
rows now if you're in a different row
spacing<00:04:33.050> that's<00:04:33.200> going<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.440> make<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.680> more

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
spacing that's going to make that more

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800 
spacing that's going to make that more
difficult<00:04:34.310> but<00:04:34.460> in<00:04:34.580> 30<00:04:34.790> inch<00:04:34.970> rows<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:35.390> like<00:04:35.630> it

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
difficult but in 30 inch rows we like it

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.510 
difficult but in 30 inch rows we like it
for<00:04:35.990> both<00:04:36.110> corn<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.530> soybeans<00:04:36.920> we<00:04:37.100> do<00:04:37.280> put<00:04:37.460> a

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
for both corn and soybeans we do put a

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550 
for both corn and soybeans we do put a
full<00:04:37.820> load<00:04:38.000> of<00:04:38.060> fertilizer<00:04:38.300> out<00:04:38.810> for<00:04:39.230> each

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
full load of fertilizer out for each

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.100 
full load of fertilizer out for each
crop<00:04:39.980> now<00:04:40.490> I'm<00:04:40.610> not<00:04:40.640> saying<00:04:40.970> we<00:04:41.150> overload<00:04:41.900> or

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
crop now I'm not saying we overload or

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.020 
crop now I'm not saying we overload or
anything<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:42.920> at<00:04:43.040> least<00:04:43.220> we're<00:04:43.550> putting<00:04:43.910> out

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
anything but at least we're putting out

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.880 
anything but at least we're putting out
enough<00:04:44.210> fertility<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:45.050> raise<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> good<00:04:45.530> soybean

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
enough fertility to raise a good soybean

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.920 
enough fertility to raise a good soybean
crop<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.520> raise<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.730> good<00:04:46.940> corn<00:04:47.180> crop<00:04:47.420> I<00:04:47.600> think

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
crop to raise a good corn crop I think

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.360 
crop to raise a good corn crop I think
that's<00:04:48.110> one<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.410> reasons<00:04:48.650> why<00:04:48.770> our<00:04:49.040> bean

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
that's one of the reasons why our bean

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.860 
that's one of the reasons why our bean
yields<00:04:49.610> are<00:04:49.850> as<00:04:49.940> good<00:04:50.090> as<00:04:50.150> they<00:04:50.330> are<00:04:50.360> because

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
yields are as good as they are because

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.020 
yields are as good as they are because
we<00:04:51.050> do<00:04:51.290> fertilize<00:04:51.770> our<00:04:51.950> beans<00:04:52.220> well<00:04:52.880> there's

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
we do fertilize our beans well there's

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.550 
we do fertilize our beans well there's
certainly<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.420> lot<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.870> things<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.350> talk<00:04:54.500> about

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
certainly a lot of things to talk about

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.380 
certainly a lot of things to talk about
when<00:04:54.920> we're<00:04:55.040> considering<00:04:55.490> which<00:04:56.030> tillage

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
when we're considering which tillage

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.150 
when we're considering which tillage
practice<00:04:56.870> we're<00:04:57.110> using<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.530> our<00:04:57.680> farm<00:04:57.950> and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
practice we're using on our farm and

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.200 
practice we're using on our farm and
what<00:04:58.280> one<00:04:58.430> you're<00:04:58.610> going<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.790> use<00:04:58.910> on<00:04:59.060> your

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
what one you're going to use on your

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.030 
what one you're going to use on your
farm<00:04:59.510> well<00:04:59.780> hey<00:04:59.930> yeah<00:05:00.140> but<00:05:00.320> before<00:05:00.800> we<00:05:00.890> say

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
farm well hey yeah but before we say

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.159 
farm well hey yeah but before we say
that<00:05:01.190> again<00:05:01.430> when<00:05:02.419> where<00:05:02.630> we<00:05:02.750> started<00:05:03.050> this

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
that again when where we started this

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.659 
that again when where we started this
whole<00:05:03.320> thing<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:04.010> can<00:05:04.160> make<00:05:04.370> anything

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
whole thing is you can make anything

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:05.980 
whole thing is you can make anything
work<00:05:05.000> you<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.270> make<00:05:05.390> no-till<00:05:05.810> where

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
work you can make no-till where

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.050 
work you can make no-till where
conventional<00:05:06.320> till<00:05:06.710> strip<00:05:07.010> till<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:07.669> don't

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
conventional till strip till so don't

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.210 
conventional till strip till so don't
don't<00:05:08.419> be<00:05:08.660> thinking<00:05:09.050> that<00:05:09.080> we're<00:05:09.530> trying<00:05:10.010> to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
don't be thinking that we're trying to

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.770 
don't be thinking that we're trying to
talk<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.640> into<00:05:10.669> doing<00:05:10.880> strip<00:05:11.360> tail<00:05:11.540> we're

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
talk you into doing strip tail we're

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.780 
talk you into doing strip tail we're
just<00:05:11.960> telling<00:05:12.169> you<00:05:12.380> hey<00:05:12.650> if<00:05:12.890> you<00:05:13.070> want<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.580> use

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
just telling you hey if you want to use

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.880 
just telling you hey if you want to use
this<00:05:14.030> tillage<00:05:14.480> practice<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:15.260> certainly<00:05:15.620> can

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
this tillage practice you certainly can

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.409 
this tillage practice you certainly can
the<00:05:16.070> reason<00:05:16.460> why<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.610> lot<00:05:16.820> of<00:05:16.880> guys<00:05:17.090> have<00:05:17.240> gone

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
the reason why a lot of guys have gone

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.390 
the reason why a lot of guys have gone
to<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:17.720> recently<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.740> because<00:05:19.010> fertilizer

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
to this recently is because fertilizer

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.190 
to this recently is because fertilizer
prices<00:05:19.640> are<00:05:19.940> high<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.390> what<00:05:20.600> they<00:05:20.720> found<00:05:20.930> is

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
prices are high and what they found is

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.020 
prices are high and what they found is
they<00:05:21.320> can<00:05:21.500> cut<00:05:21.800> their<00:05:22.010> fertilizer<00:05:22.460> rate<00:05:22.820> or

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
they can cut their fertilizer rate or

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.730 
they can cut their fertilizer rate or
put<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.390> another<00:05:23.480> way<00:05:23.720> in<00:05:24.050> order<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.500> get<00:05:24.620> the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
put it another way in order to get the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.710 
put it another way in order to get the
same<00:05:24.950> yields<00:05:25.430> they<00:05:25.700> need<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.970> put<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> lot

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
same yields they need to put on a lot

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.280 
same yields they need to put on a lot
more<00:05:27.140> broadcast<00:05:28.100> P&amp;K<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.480> get<00:05:29.630> that<00:05:29.810> same<00:05:30.110> kind

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
more broadcast P&amp;K to get that same kind

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.260 
more broadcast P&amp;K to get that same kind
of<00:05:30.440> result<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.010> on<00:05:31.130> our<00:05:31.280> farm<00:05:31.550> we've<00:05:31.790> run<00:05:32.030> a

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
of result so on our farm we've run a

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.969 
of result so on our farm we've run a
study<00:05:32.690> for<00:05:32.870> about<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.110> last<00:05:33.140> 10<00:05:33.590> years<00:05:33.620> on

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
study for about the last 10 years on

in<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:43.640> broadcast<00:05:44.090> okay<00:05:44.540> so<00:05:44.600> think<00:05:44.990> about<00:05:45.110> how

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
in the broadcast okay so think about how

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.719 
in the broadcast okay so think about how
many<00:05:45.290> more<00:05:45.560> dollars<00:05:45.919> who<00:05:46.070> spent<00:05:46.370> there<00:05:46.580> and

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
many more dollars who spent there and

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.300 
many more dollars who spent there and
which<00:05:47.479> is<00:05:47.660> getting<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:47.960> most<00:05:48.080> yield<00:05:48.410> neither

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
which is getting the most yield neither

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.070 
which is getting the most yield neither
one<00:05:49.460> they're<00:05:49.610> about<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:49.910> same<00:05:50.060> okay<00:05:50.390> so<00:05:50.450> you

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
one they're about the same okay so you

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.780 
one they're about the same okay so you
can<00:05:51.110> spend<00:05:51.830> a<00:05:51.979> bunch<00:05:52.130> more<00:05:52.340> money<00:05:52.550> in<00:05:52.669> do

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
can spend a bunch more money in do

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.730 
can spend a bunch more money in do
broadcast<00:05:53.270> or<00:05:53.479> you<00:05:53.810> can<00:05:53.990> reduce<00:05:54.470> that

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
broadcast or you can reduce that

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.650 
broadcast or you can reduce that
fertilizer<00:05:55.250> costs<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.880> put<00:05:56.150> it<00:05:56.240> in<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.450> strip

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
fertilizer costs and put it in the strip

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.510 
fertilizer costs and put it in the strip
too<00:05:56.810> well<00:05:57.140> not<00:05:57.290> only<00:05:57.500> are<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.919> going<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.340> have

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
too well not only are you going to have

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.190 
too well not only are you going to have
more<00:05:58.760> availability<00:05:59.360> because<00:05:59.690> that

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
more availability because that

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.780 
more availability because that
fertilizer<00:06:00.650> is<00:06:00.860> right<00:06:01.130> around<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.580> root

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
fertilizer is right around the root

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.090 
fertilizer is right around the root
system<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:02.510> roots<00:06:02.720> can<00:06:02.960> eat<00:06:03.440> more<00:06:03.740> easily

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
system so the roots can eat more easily

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.980 
system so the roots can eat more easily
access<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.850> you're<00:06:05.000> going<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.180> less<00:06:05.419> tie<00:06:05.750> up

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
access it you're going to less tie up

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.719 
access it you're going to less tie up
especially<00:06:06.229> if<00:06:06.560> you've<00:06:06.680> got<00:06:06.919> problems<00:06:07.310> with

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
especially if you've got problems with

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.640 
especially if you've got problems with
your<00:06:07.880> so<00:06:08.060> maybe<00:06:08.300> you've<00:06:08.450> got<00:06:08.630> high<00:06:08.840> pH<00:06:09.200> or<00:06:09.410> low

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
your so maybe you've got high pH or low

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.500 
your so maybe you've got high pH or low
pH<00:06:10.100> or<00:06:10.340> you've<00:06:10.520> got<00:06:10.700> a<00:06:10.729> high<00:06:11.000> level<00:06:11.419> of

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
pH or you've got a high level of

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.540 
pH or you've got a high level of
magnesium<00:06:12.290> or<00:06:12.470> something<00:06:12.830> in<00:06:12.919> your<00:06:13.040> soil<00:06:13.220> it's

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
magnesium or something in your soil it's

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.850 
magnesium or something in your soil it's
going<00:06:13.700> to<00:06:13.760> tie<00:06:14.000> things<00:06:14.360> up<00:06:14.630> well<00:06:14.930> not<00:06:15.290> only<00:06:15.470> are

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
going to tie things up well not only are

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.260 
going to tie things up well not only are
you<00:06:15.919> going<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.160> avoid<00:06:16.460> some<00:06:16.790> of<00:06:16.820> that<00:06:17.030> tie<00:06:17.210> up

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
you going to avoid some of that tie up

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.850 
you going to avoid some of that tie up
by<00:06:17.450> putting<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:17.810> close<00:06:17.960> together<00:06:18.200> you<00:06:18.680> can

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
by putting it close together you can

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.830 
by putting it close together you can
certainly<00:06:19.130> use<00:06:19.220> products<00:06:19.790> like<00:06:19.850> a<00:06:20.030> veil<00:06:20.479> to

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
certainly use products like a veil to

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.930 
certainly use products like a veil to
try<00:06:21.080> and<00:06:21.200> protect<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:21.830> fertilizer<00:06:22.400> from<00:06:22.729> tie

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
try and protect that fertilizer from tie

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.760 
try and protect that fertilizer from tie
up<00:06:23.120> to<00:06:23.360> so<00:06:23.630> you<00:06:23.690> get<00:06:23.930> kind<00:06:24.200> of<00:06:24.290> a<00:06:24.380> double

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
up to so you get kind of a double

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.290 
up to so you get kind of a double
benefit<00:06:25.130> by<00:06:25.310> putting<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.669> in<00:06:25.760> the<00:06:25.880> strip<00:06:26.090> well

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
benefit by putting it in the strip well

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.120 
benefit by putting it in the strip well
once<00:06:26.570> again<00:06:26.720> stripped<00:06:27.169> hill<00:06:27.320> is<00:06:27.500> a<00:06:27.530> growing

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
once again stripped hill is a growing

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.550 
once again stripped hill is a growing
practice<00:06:28.880> in<00:06:29.030> the<00:06:29.060> United<00:06:29.419> States<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:30.140> reason

practice in the United States the reason

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.409 
practice in the United States the reason
why<00:06:30.710> it's<00:06:31.040> gained<00:06:31.340> so<00:06:31.610> much<00:06:31.729> in<00:06:31.790> popularity

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
why it's gained so much in popularity

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.120 
why it's gained so much in popularity
the<00:06:32.570> last<00:06:32.750> few<00:06:32.900> years<00:06:32.990> it's<00:06:33.530> not<00:06:33.680> only<00:06:33.860> high

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
the last few years it's not only high

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.950 
the last few years it's not only high
fertilizer<00:06:34.610> prices<00:06:34.850> it<00:06:35.150> also<00:06:35.390> has<00:06:35.539> a<00:06:35.570> lot<00:06:35.810> to

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
fertilizer prices it also has a lot to

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.230 
fertilizer prices it also has a lot to
do<00:06:36.140> with<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.500> fact<00:06:36.530> that<00:06:36.800> now<00:06:37.010> we<00:06:37.070> have<00:06:37.340> our<00:06:37.550> TK

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
do with the fact that now we have our TK

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.600 
do with the fact that now we have our TK
