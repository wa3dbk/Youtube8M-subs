 [Music] 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.450
 Good morning, daniel, here in the kitchen. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 the most beloved of the house for me I have 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 sure that for you and who you are 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.790
 watching also look that we are going 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 talk about the organization of our friends 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.840
 cookware because they have to stay in order 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:29.250
 to make your recipe nice 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 just can not the boss is sad but it is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 It's true that our day would 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.960
 day since our pot cabinet is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 everything messy is formatting in the middle is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.059
 cover is this wood that we go 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.399
 putting it in the easiest place and ends up 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 end transforming our place that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 superpractic ought to be true. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.580
 mess then to solve we go 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:59.799
 get everything sorted out and put in order 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.799
 [Music] 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.290
 Only when we start smoking does 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.970
 of the size of the mess and then hands the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.870
 My friend, come on, let's get it done. 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.600
 all 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.580
 the first thing is a cabinet in general the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.270
 People always put pots underneath. 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.670
 the sink 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.190
 even though it is not ideal because it is a 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.660
 place that can put more unity is there 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.580
 that they will be saved because the penalty 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.870
 always on the side of the stove and pans in 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 cooker set 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.980
 the tip is that you guarantee your closet 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.320
 under the sink as long as possible 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.090
 so I look alive to catch all of them 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.310
 the leaks as quickly as possible 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.100
 keep the daughter's fence always a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.990
 silicone to be durable cookware for 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 more time and always in that cleaning 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.030
 in that nice engineer in order josue 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.250
 super important then those pans 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.000
 you use - promoter daniel more 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 Special 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.540
 you lay in the background that those of the day 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.100
 the day to prepare the rice and the beans 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.520
 are the front 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.880
 Another important thing is to organize 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.929
 their windows by size always the largest 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 to the minor 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.160
 and then you can make a stack 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.350
 very pretty and stable to keep the tone 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.300
 yellowish for longer 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.880
 Another thing for the lieutenant is always 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.070
 ask for equals as equals then 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 the streams all together the pans 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.110
 all together and the shapes that were 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.840
 in the cabinet placed together with the other 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.420
 shapes so you will know easily 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:39.459
 Where everything is in the alone one? 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.459
 [Music] 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.120
 now with the pans all in order not 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.640
 replace the cover 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.740
 the tip is to leave them standing next to the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.250
 pots and make it easier to access 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.250
 come on
