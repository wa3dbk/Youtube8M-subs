00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.780 
so that's just one two three four five
six<00:01:03.690> seven<00:01:04.199> eight<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
six seven eight but you do that with the
gallop<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> again<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.619> left

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
right right and then left right left

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.450 
right right and then left right left
left<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.229> together<00:01:13.460> five

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
left so if we put that all together five

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.070 
left so if we put that all together five
six<00:01:15.119> seven<00:01:15.990> eight<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:17.189> three<00:01:18.000> four<00:01:18.540> five

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
six seven eight one two three four five

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
six seven eight one two three four five
six<00:01:19.590> seven<00:01:20.100> eight

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
six seven eight

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
six seven eight
so<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.229> dance<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> lesser<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
so in this dance they use the lesser in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
so in this dance they use the lesser in
two<00:01:23.670> ways<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.210> way<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.990> gallop<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> with<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
two ways one way your gallop in with the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
two ways one way your gallop in with the
lissu<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.810> four

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
lissu and then one way you let's do four

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
lissu and then one way you let's do four
four<00:01:28.350> counts<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> stop<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.180> four

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
four counts and then you stop for four

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109 
four counts and then you stop for four
counts<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> still<00:01:31.110> listen<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.220> one

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
counts but you still listen so we go one

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
counts but you still listen so we go one
two<00:01:33.450> three<00:01:34.079> four<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> lassoo<00:01:36.780> one

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
two three four and then you lassoo one

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.010 
two three four and then you lassoo one
two<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.670> slowly<00:01:39.180> for<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> third<00:01:39.750> time

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
two and then slowly for the third time

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.789 
two and then slowly for the third time
so<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> try<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> five<00:01:42.090> six<00:01:42.750> seven<00:01:43.619> eight

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
so if we try that five six seven eight

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.149 
so if we try that five six seven eight
one<00:01:44.520> two<00:01:44.850> three<00:01:45.149> four<00:01:45.829> five<00:01:46.829> six<00:01:47.479> seven<00:01:48.479> eight

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.190 
one two three four five six seven eight
so<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> next<00:01:50.490> part<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> dance<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.020> hip

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
so the next part of the dance is the hip

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.170 
so the next part of the dance is the hip
flick<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> foot<00:01:53.130> shuffle<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:53.970> put

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
flick with a foot shuffle now you put

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
flick with a foot shuffle now you put
your<00:01:54.299> hands<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:54.720> hips<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.070> your

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
your hands on your hips and you use your

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
your hands on your hips and you use your
right<00:01:56.700> leg<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.210> flick<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
right leg to flick out and you do that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.520 
right leg to flick out and you do that
four<00:01:58.860> times<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.549> use<00:01:59.939> your<00:02:00.509> hip<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.200> help<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
four times but use your hip to help you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
four times but use your hip to help you
make<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.829> movement<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.909> four

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
make that movement and use that four

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.830 
make that movement and use that four
times<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.590> two<00:02:05.369> three<00:02:05.840> four

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
