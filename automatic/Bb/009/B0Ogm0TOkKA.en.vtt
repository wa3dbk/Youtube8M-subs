don't<00:00:47.760> really<00:00:48.570> look<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.309> animated

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
don't really look like the animated

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
don't really look like the animated
characters<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.980> show<00:00:53.010> they've<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
characters on the show they've the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
characters on the show they've the
styler<00:00:54.930> thus<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> style<00:00:55.879> they<00:00:56.879> did<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.210> use

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
styler thus the style they did not use

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.849 
styler thus the style they did not use
the<00:00:57.600> animated<00:00:58.050> stylized

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the animated stylized

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
the animated stylized
type<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> figure<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.989> turned<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
type of figure they actually turned it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
type of figure they actually turned it
into<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.620> very<00:01:01.800> realistic<00:01:02.250> type<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> figure<00:01:03.570> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
into a very realistic type of figure so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
into a very realistic type of figure so
that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> could<00:01:04.140> blend<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> figure<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.309> with

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
that you could blend the figure in with

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
that you could blend the figure in with
your<00:01:05.640> other<00:01:05.820> GI<00:01:06.060> Joe<00:01:06.270> collections<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.900> think

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
your other GI Joe collections I think

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
your other GI Joe collections I think
that<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> idea<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that was the idea but this one in

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.130 
that was the idea but this one in
particular<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:11.510> he<00:01:12.510> does<00:01:12.900> look

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
particular I think he does look

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.780 
particular I think he does look
realistic<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.130> he<00:01:14.250> looks<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> lot

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
realistic but I think he looks a lot

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.710 
realistic but I think he looks a lot
cartoony<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.490> am<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.299> big

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
cartoony which is what I like I am a big

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
cartoony which is what I like I am a big
fan<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> those<00:01:19.259> cartoon<00:01:19.770> looking<00:01:20.310> enemy

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fan of those cartoon looking enemy

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.800 
fan of those cartoon looking enemy
looking<00:01:21.600> type<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> figures<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.030> like

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
looking type of figures and and I like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
looking type of figures and and I like
the<00:01:24.990> artwork<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> renegades<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
with this one looking a little bit on

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.520 
with this one looking a little bit on
the<00:01:29.340> cartoonish<00:01:29.970> side<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.439> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the cartoonish side really really is a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
the cartoonish side really really is a
plus<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> big<00:01:32.970> fan<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
plus for me not a big fan of the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
plus for me not a big fan of the
character<00:01:33.479> though<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.350> he<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
character though I mean he was more of a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990 
character though I mean he was more of a
pyromaniac<00:01:35.759> he<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> fire<00:01:37.520> watch<00:01:38.520> my

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pyromaniac he was like the fire watch my

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.020 
pyromaniac he was like the fire watch my
fire<00:01:39.360> grow<00:01:39.990> he<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.430> thought<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
fire grow he was like he thought the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
fire grow he was like he thought the
fire<00:01:42.240> he<00:01:42.840> thought<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.290> could<00:01:43.320> give<00:01:43.619> birth<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
fire he thought he could give birth to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
fire he thought he could give birth to
fire<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.470> he<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.009> his<00:01:47.159> pet<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:48.450> was

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
fire and he it was like his pet it was

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.440 
fire and he it was like his pet it was
really<00:01:48.960> weird<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
really weird it was not really the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.810 
really weird it was not really the
Firefly<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.350> we've<00:01:52.560> come<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.579> grow

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
Firefly that we've come to know and grow

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.039 
Firefly that we've come to know and grow
and<00:01:54.030> love<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.759> eighties<00:01:57.000> GI<00:01:57.270> Joe<00:01:57.570> but

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and love in in the eighties GI Joe but

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.709 
and love in in the eighties GI Joe but
you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.320> Hasbro<00:01:58.950> needed<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.579> change<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you know Hasbro needed to change up the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.380 
you know Hasbro needed to change up the
character<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.409> anyway<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.000> part

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
character so anyway I think that's part

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.130 
character so anyway I think that's part
of<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> reason<00:02:03.990> why<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:05.159> show<00:02:05.399> failed<00:02:05.729> they

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
of the reason why the show failed they

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
of the reason why the show failed they
attracted<00:02:07.140> too<00:02:07.380> much<00:02:07.970> from<00:02:08.970> cannon<00:02:09.450> from<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
attracted too much from cannon from the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.440 
attracted too much from cannon from the
eighties<00:02:10.080> cannon<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
eighties cannon and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.480 
eighties cannon and
well<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.720> hope<00:02:13.080> they'd<00:02:13.290> still<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:14.160> know<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> hope

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
well I hope they'd still you know I hope

on<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.239> particular<00:03:36.600> figure<00:03:37.010> he<00:03:38.010> also<00:03:38.220> comes

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
on this particular figure he also comes

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.780 
on this particular figure he also comes
strangely<00:03:39.390> enough<00:03:39.630> with<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> bomb<00:03:40.549> not<00:03:41.549> the

this<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.570> could<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.930> suppose<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.950> could

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
this this could I suppose this could

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.599 
this this could I suppose this could
work

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
work

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.610 
work
but<00:03:48.090> look<00:03:48.269> really<00:03:48.630> looks<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> mortar

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
but look really looks more like a mortar

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.110 
but look really looks more like a mortar
shell<00:03:49.730> rather<00:03:50.730> than<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.390> pyrotechnic<00:03:52.100> bomb<00:03:53.120> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
shell rather than a pyrotechnic bomb and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.190 
shell rather than a pyrotechnic bomb and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
also as with most Firefly figures he

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.300 
also as with most Firefly figures he
comes<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:59.450> 1980s<00:04:00.450> 1990s<00:04:01.019> cell<00:04:01.980> phone
