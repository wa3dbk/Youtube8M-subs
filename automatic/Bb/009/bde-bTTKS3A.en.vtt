the<00:01:29.979> story<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:32.429> guess<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:35.170> was<00:01:35.349> just<00:01:35.409> I

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the story and I guess that was just I

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.080 
the story and I guess that was just I
was<00:01:36.069> just<00:01:36.219> wondering<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:36.670> things<00:01:36.909> that

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
was just wondering the things that

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.889 
was just wondering the things that
happened<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:40.000> night<00:01:40.149> when<00:01:40.329> my<00:01:40.390> mom<00:01:40.689> was

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
happened on the night when my mom was

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.429 
happened on the night when my mom was
all<00:01:41.200> right<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.129> come<00:01:42.340> home<00:01:42.629> and<00:01:43.629> she<00:01:43.989> saw<00:01:44.200> some

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
all right and come home and she saw some

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.699 
all right and come home and she saw some
kids<00:01:44.619> go<00:01:44.979> lots<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.459> cars<00:01:46.289> hobey-ho<00:01:48.299> logic<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.989> I

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
kids go lots of cars hobey-ho logic so I

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.889 
kids go lots of cars hobey-ho logic so I
guess<00:01:51.069> in<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.909> sense<00:01:52.209> I<00:01:52.360> guess<00:01:52.390> bother<00:01:52.689> with

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
guess in that sense I guess bother with

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.850 
guess in that sense I guess bother with
