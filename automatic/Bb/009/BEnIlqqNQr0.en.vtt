but a big big thing with backups right
now<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.109> they'll<00:00:16.289> compress<00:00:16.830> an<00:00:17.010> entire<00:00:17.310> image

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
now is they'll compress an entire image

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.970 
now is they'll compress an entire image
like<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.119> exact<00:00:18.480> replica<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> disc<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> dot

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980

like an exact replica of a disc to a dot
iso<00:00:20.580> file<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.750> come<00:00:21.869> across<00:00:22.109> these

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
iso file so when you come across these

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.439

you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.830> actually<00:00:23.189> burn<00:00:23.430> an<00:00:23.640> exact<00:00:23.970> replica

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you can actually burn an exact replica

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.370 
you can actually burn an exact replica
of<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.689> disc<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> CD<00:00:26.330> using<00:00:27.330> an<00:00:27.420> ISO<00:00:28.080> image
