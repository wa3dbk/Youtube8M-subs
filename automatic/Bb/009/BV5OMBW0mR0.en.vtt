00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.440
 but also learn 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.520
 question number two 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 regulator throughout this period 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 generator 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.199
 I'm not used to 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.529
 generator 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.669
 however as 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.650
 Portland 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.189
 production at the expense of the synagogue 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.249
 unit 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.749
 that is, if this is installed 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.460
 fact 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 just in case magnetic on court 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.570
 georgia communism 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 but with the shift of francisco 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.380
 definition 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.160
 chain hold 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.650
 there are various devices in particular 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.530
 Here is such a suddenly felt 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.340
 how is it made 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.370
 adjustment itself 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.420
 first we relax 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.600
 mounting options for russian generators 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.270
 there's this bike down and this one 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 projects lets 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.430
 not much just give freedom to the test 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.040
 then we lower with the heaviest heart 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 this football 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
 thereafter 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.180
 pry bar 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.270
 steel sailors 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 it is seen 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.910
 heads 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.900
 block car 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.450
 we put 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.290
 necessary efforts to 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.870
 the romans on the movie and because in the process 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.880
 operation usually occurs 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.670
 summer achievements are the opposite 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.670
 here we are replacing in the middle between you 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.420
 the degree of tension is pressed so that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 us strip red our curtains 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.350
 reached the point 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.500
 have shifted here these two halves 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.390
 if they are in the bam zone 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.279
 then we are to them 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.469
 delaying first 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.469
 here is this post 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.989
 then later by this he 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.929
 negative russia 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.329
 Vologda generator 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.939
 check again to control the world 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.259
 if you have 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.329
 Well, that is, showed have not changed 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 procedure started 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.519
 fluctuations in the gender and the crowd 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.260
 approximately the same thing happens 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.729
 starts up 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.109
 in the third 3 Galician 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.909
 also produced per year 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.589

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 pushing argun every move 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.589
 the length of each business 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.649
 and just the same is very correct 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:59.779
 nutrition 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.129
 exposing 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.609
 because we have 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.339
 traces of the score
