00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.500
 If I have the curry tonight 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.780
 Is it better to eat a drop of no more? 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.340
 In your impression, you are frowning deeply. 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.120
 Tell me that you don't have to eat any more. 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.180
 If I was the kind, I would be bullied. 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 It is the words of person who can return. 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.040
 Then maybe you will be better than now 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.280
 Smile more brilliantly. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.840
 If I can be alone, 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.200
 Do not bring any trouble to you. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.640
 But ah, this way, maybe I will never know you. 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.800
 It’s not necessarily living like this. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.340
 If I am a liar 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.780
 Are you willing to scold me like this? 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.140
 So many "if hypotheses" 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.440
 Gradually emerge in my room 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 In the days of nothing 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.460
 From the crack 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.040
 Missed a lot of "if" 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.000
 gradually. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.900
 I close my eyes now. 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.080
 Plug your ears and go out 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.520
 Although it is your voice or your smile 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.880
 I can't see it, but maybe it's not bad. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.880
 If there are only nasty things. 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.280
 Able from the head 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.700
 If it disappears 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.140
 How good is that. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.940
 If I am an honest person 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.320
 Do you believe this is the last? 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.680
 You must laugh at me. 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.900
 I thought I knew everything. 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.400
 I want to tell you several times. 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.140
 But impossible to convey 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.520
 I can only wonder "How can this be?" 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.320
 If you can go to you. 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.760
 But the trembling knee is laughing at me. 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.520
 Say "Live". 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.320
 If I am alive. 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.540
 a song for you to listen to 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.900
 Although still very embarrassed and did not give you 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.440
 But still want to sing to you? 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.860
 I will think about it someday. 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.280
 It’s good to be able to convey it, and I will tell you one day. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.520
 I close my eyes now. 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.480
 Plug your ears and go out 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.520
 Although it is your voice or your smile 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.540
 I can't see it, but maybe it's not bad. 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.140
 I close my eyes now. 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.560
 Plug your ears and go out 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.960
 Although it is your voice or your smile 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.000
 I can't see it, but maybe it's not bad.
