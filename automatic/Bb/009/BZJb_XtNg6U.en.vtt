has<00:02:21.430> been<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:22.150> fantastic<00:02:22.510> little<00:02:22.870> car<00:02:23.020> more

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
has been a fantastic little car more

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.800 
has been a fantastic little car more
than<00:02:24.070> enough<00:02:24.310> power<00:02:24.490> it's<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:25.240> little<00:02:25.510> rocket

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
than enough power it's a little rocket

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.940 
than enough power it's a little rocket
out<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.170> ice

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
out on the ice

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.060 
out on the ice
you<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.060> much<00:02:28.210> as<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.480> need<00:02:28.630> and

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you know that's as much as you need and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.860 
you know that's as much as you need and
seems<00:02:30.070> well<00:02:30.730> built<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.210> strong<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.660> was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
seems well built it's strong it was

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.380 
seems well built it's strong it was
really<00:02:32.230> impressive<00:02:33.160> one

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
really impressive one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.590 
really impressive one
the<00:02:35.110> program<00:02:35.470> itself<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.850> car<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
the program itself do the car this is

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.620 
the program itself do the car this is
150<00:02:38.200> PS<00:02:38.980> turbo<00:02:39.670> diesel<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> really<00:02:40.390> really

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
150 PS turbo diesel is really really

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.110 
150 PS turbo diesel is really really
efficient<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.410> car<00:02:41.620> management<00:02:42.190> entirely<00:02:42.700> in
