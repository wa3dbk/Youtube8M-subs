wheels out there and it's not as good as
a<00:01:09.960> physical<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.009> actually<00:01:11.430> does<00:01:11.729> work

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a physical one but it actually does work

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
a physical one but it actually does work
fairly<00:01:12.180> well<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> other<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.259> unique

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.039 
blue laser that's Microsoft's bluetrack
technology<00:02:05.880> we've<00:02:06.270> seen<00:02:06.479> blue<00:02:06.659> track<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
technology we've seen blue track and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.120 
technology we've seen blue track and
other<00:02:07.170> mice<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.009> pretty

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
other mice and it's actually pretty

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.620 
other mice and it's actually pretty
useful<00:02:08.250> lets<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:08.910> use<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.240> mouse<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.600> a

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
useful lets you use the mouse on a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.420 
useful lets you use the mouse on a

surfaces to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.089 
surfaces to
a glass<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.689> gives<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.829> some<00:02:15.010> nice

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
a glass so it gives you some nice

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.380 
a glass so it gives you some nice
versatility<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.819> terms<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.060> where<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.269> can

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
versatility in terms of where you can

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.209 
versatility in terms of where you can
actually<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:16.659> this<00:02:16.900> thing<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:17.890> do<00:02:18.069> like

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219 
actually use this thing now we do like

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.199 
actually use this thing now we do like
the<00:02:18.340> squirrel<00:02:18.579> wheel<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.879> we<00:02:18.939> think<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
the squirrel wheel and we think the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.209 
the squirrel wheel and we think the
design<00:02:19.359> is<00:02:19.569> pretty<00:02:20.049> unique<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.799> that's<00:02:21.069> said

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
design is pretty unique but that's said

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.619 
design is pretty unique but that's said
we<00:02:21.340> wouldn't<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.909> as<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.209> mouse<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
we wouldn't use this as a mouse to

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.479 
we wouldn't use this as a mouse to
replace<00:02:22.989> our<00:02:23.200> standard<00:02:23.709> desktop<00:02:23.920> model

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
replace our standard desktop model

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.220 
replace our standard desktop model
there's<00:02:25.120> no<00:02:25.209> thumb<00:02:25.480> side<00:02:25.719> buttons<00:02:26.079> for

there's no thumb side buttons for

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.809 
there's no thumb side buttons for
example<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.799> there's<00:02:26.950> no<00:02:27.069> quick<00:02:27.370> forward<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
example so there's no quick forward and

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.179 
example so there's no quick forward and
back<00:02:27.969> between<00:02:28.180> web<00:02:28.540> pages<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.139> you<00:02:29.739> can<00:02:29.980> use

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
back between web pages and you can use

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.369 
back between web pages and you can use
the<00:02:30.370> software<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.939> make<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> third<00:02:31.510> button<00:02:31.780> here

the software to make a third button here
in<00:02:32.469> the<00:02:32.560> middle<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.760> still<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
in the middle but it's still just a

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.849 
in the middle but it's still just a
little<00:02:34.420> bit<00:02:34.719> awkward<00:02:35.109> when<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.290> never<00:02:35.560> really

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
little bit awkward when we never really

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.429 
little bit awkward when we never really
felt<00:02:36.189> that<00:02:36.900> confident<00:02:37.900> using<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.230> mouse

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
felt that confident using this mouse

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.410 
felt that confident using this mouse
it's<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.769> little<00:02:39.040> bit<00:02:39.189> sort<00:02:39.639> of<00:02:39.730> flimsy<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
it's a little bit sort of flimsy and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.849 
it's a little bit sort of flimsy and
definitely<00:02:40.900> made<00:02:41.049> with<00:02:41.200> travel<00:02:41.680> and

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
definitely made with travel and

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.399 
definitely made with travel and
lightweight<00:02:42.519> in<00:02:42.700> mind<00:02:42.969> so<00:02:43.810> overall<00:02:43.989> we<00:02:44.200> think

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
lightweight in mind so overall we think

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.289
