00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:09.139 
okay so being from the CG world is

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:11.260 
okay so being from the CG world is
actually<00:00:09.530> you<00:00:09.920> know<00:00:10.040> more<00:00:10.340> complex<00:00:10.820> things<00:00:10.910> I

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.270 
actually you know more complex things I

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.980 
actually you know more complex things I
want<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.510> be<00:00:11.630> able<00:00:11.719> to<00:00:12.020> look<00:00:12.740> at<00:00:12.980> through<00:00:13.309> a<00:00:14.000> ram

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
want to be able to look at through a ram

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.660 
want to be able to look at through a ram
player<00:00:15.289> and<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.010> I'm<00:00:16.160> going<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.340> talk<00:00:16.520> about

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
player and so I'm going to talk about

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.040 
player and so I'm going to talk about
some<00:00:16.910> of<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.060> other<00:00:17.180> things<00:00:17.240> that<00:00:17.539> pd<00:00:17.869> player

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
some of the other things that pd player

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.840 
some of the other things that pd player
can<00:00:18.260> do<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:18.410> know<00:00:18.650> you'll<00:00:18.920> start<00:00:19.160> to<00:00:19.190> see<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
can do I know you'll start to see the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.120 
can do I know you'll start to see the
layers<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.539> layers<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:21.140> stuff<00:00:21.290> stuff<00:00:21.830> that

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
layers and layers and stuff stuff that

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.700 
layers and layers and stuff stuff that
is<00:00:22.340> actually<00:00:22.820> possible<00:00:23.060> within<00:00:23.570> PD<00:00:23.900> player<00:00:24.140> so

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
is actually possible within PD player so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.400 
is actually possible within PD player so
going<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.190> go<00:00:25.280> ahead<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.990> remove<00:00:26.990> that<00:00:27.020> from

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
going to go ahead and remove that from

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.830 
going to go ahead and remove that from
the<00:00:27.740> list<00:00:28.340> of<00:00:28.490> things<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.910> do<00:00:29.060> and<00:00:29.240> I'm<00:00:29.660> going

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
the list of things to do and I'm going

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.570 
the list of things to do and I'm going
to<00:00:29.900> go<00:00:29.990> ahead<00:00:30.020> and<00:00:30.260> load<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:30.770> walk<00:00:31.130> cycle

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
to go ahead and load this walk cycle

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.840 
to go ahead and load this walk cycle
here<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:32.000> this<00:00:32.750> wolf<00:00:33.430> it's<00:00:34.430> going<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.670> go<00:00:34.730> ahead

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
here of this wolf it's going to go ahead

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.360 
here of this wolf it's going to go ahead
and<00:00:34.969> load<00:00:35.239> that<00:00:35.420> up<00:00:35.450> in<00:00:35.719> RAM<00:00:35.980> and<00:00:36.980> you'll<00:00:37.159> look

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
and load that up in RAM and you'll look

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.639 
and load that up in RAM and you'll look
at<00:00:37.550> this<00:00:37.699> this<00:00:38.300> Ram<00:00:38.510> player<00:00:38.749> I<00:00:38.809> don't<00:00:38.989> have<00:00:39.140> I'm

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
at this this Ram player I don't have I'm

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.099 
at this this Ram player I don't have I'm
actually<00:00:39.829> playing<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:40.309> off<00:00:40.489> my<00:00:40.960> two<00:00:41.960> year

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
actually playing this off my two year

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.630 
actually playing this off my two year
old<00:00:42.199> laptop<00:00:42.679> so<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:42.949> actually<00:00:43.219> a<00:00:43.280> little<00:00:43.399> bit

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
old laptop so it's actually a little bit

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.040 
old laptop so it's actually a little bit
slower<00:00:44.359> but<00:00:45.109> it<00:00:45.260> still<00:00:45.440> works<00:00:45.859> pretty<00:00:46.010> well

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
slower but it still works pretty well

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.579 
slower but it still works pretty well
the<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:49.370> RAM<00:00:49.579> will<00:00:49.850> basically<00:00:50.440> indicate<00:00:51.440> how

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
the the RAM will basically indicate how

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:52.989 
the the RAM will basically indicate how
much<00:00:51.710> RAM<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.069> have<00:00:52.100> left<00:00:52.429> I<00:00:52.519> have<00:00:52.640> two<00:00:52.819> gigs

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
much RAM you have left I have two gigs

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.389 
much RAM you have left I have two gigs
of<00:00:53.149> RAM<00:00:53.300> on<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:53.569> machine<00:00:53.749> so<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:55.129> all<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
of RAM on this machine so with all the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.739 
of RAM on this machine so with all the
other<00:00:55.550> stuff<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:55.999> have<00:00:56.149> loaded<00:00:56.389> on<00:00:56.629> this

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
other stuff that I have loaded on this

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.809 
other stuff that I have loaded on this
computer<00:00:56.960> that's<00:00:57.440> actually<00:00:57.829> not<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:58.639> much

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
computer that's actually not that much

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.469 
computer that's actually not that much
anymore<00:00:59.179> these<00:00:59.420> days<00:00:59.559> anyway<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.389> here's<00:01:02.389> a

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.550 
clip of a wolf that's going to be
walking<00:01:04.870> although<00:01:05.870> these<00:01:05.990> clips<00:01:06.229> by<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.440> way

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
walking although these clips by the way

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.649 
walking although these clips by the way
are<00:01:06.650> provided<00:01:07.070> by<00:01:07.120> 50<00:01:08.120> degrees<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
are provided by 50 degrees and

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.160 
are provided by 50 degrees and
fifth-degree<00:01:09.500> has<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> makers<00:01:11.540> behind<00:01:11.930> a

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
fifth-degree has is the makers behind a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.810 
fifth-degree has is the makers behind a
pv<00:01:12.710> player<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.450> it's<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.500> quite<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> nice<00:01:16.100> CG

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
pv player and it's a quite a nice CG

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.700 
pv player and it's a quite a nice CG
element<00:01:16.850> here<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.660> wolf<00:01:17.960> doing<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.470> walk

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
element here of a wolf doing a walk

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.780 
element here of a wolf doing a walk
cycle<00:01:19.360> so<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.690> see<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:20.900> clip<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
cycle so you can see that clip going the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.030 
cycle so you can see that clip going the
reason<00:01:23.120> this<00:01:23.240> clip<00:01:23.480> is<00:01:23.590> interesting<00:01:24.590> for<00:01:24.980> us

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
reason this clip is interesting for us

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.920 
reason this clip is interesting for us
to<00:01:25.490> look<00:01:25.640> at<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> fact<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.510> basically

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
to look at is the fact that basically

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.640 
to look at is the fact that basically
this<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.590> full<00:01:28.400> ECG<00:01:28.820> wolf<00:01:29.480> and<00:01:29.810> actually<00:01:30.470> has

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
this is a full ECG wolf and actually has

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.390 
this is a full ECG wolf and actually has
a<00:01:30.680> complete<00:01:31.160> alpha<00:01:31.490> if<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:32.180> hit<00:01:32.510> a<00:01:33.070> you'll<00:01:34.070> see

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
a complete alpha if I hit a you'll see

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.090 
a complete alpha if I hit a you'll see
the<00:01:34.550> actual<00:01:34.880> alpha<00:01:35.330> channel<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.140> being

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the actual alpha channel that is being

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.690 
the actual alpha channel that is being
done<00:01:37.460> through<00:01:38.000> PE<00:01:38.360> player<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.740> can<00:01:40.400> hit<00:01:40.550> a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
done through PE player so I can hit a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.460 
done through PE player so I can hit a
again<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.240> we'll<00:01:41.330> go<00:01:41.450> back<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.780> RGB<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.230> so

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
again and we'll go back to RGB and so

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.520 
again and we'll go back to RGB and so
this<00:01:43.010> right<00:01:43.220> here<00:01:43.280> tells<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:43.940> alpha<00:01:44.570> our<00:01:44.990> gbr

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
this right here tells you alpha our gbr

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.070 
this right here tells you alpha our gbr
to<00:01:45.680> ultra<00:01:45.980> be<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.730> you<00:01:46.820> can<00:01:47.150> get<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> basic

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
to ultra be so you can get the basic

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.690 
to ultra be so you can get the basic
idea<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.440> what's<00:01:49.220> going<00:01:49.310> on<00:01:51.280> with<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.400> alpha

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
idea of what's going on with the alpha

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.340 
idea of what's going on with the alpha
being<00:01:52.910> shown<00:01:53.180> what<00:01:53.510> I<00:01:53.540> want<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.870> be<00:01:54.080> able<00:01:54.140> to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
being shown what I want to be able to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.100 
being shown what I want to be able to
show<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.590> guys<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:54.980> if<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.790> hit<00:01:55.970> this<00:01:56.110> checker

show you guys is if I hit this checker
pattern<00:01:57.380> button<00:01:58.220> right<00:01:58.340> here<00:01:58.370> I'm<00:01:59.060> actually

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
pattern button right here I'm actually

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.480 
pattern button right here I'm actually
can<00:01:59.660> see<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.230> alpha<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.890> what's<00:02:01.340> actually

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
can see the alpha of what's actually

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.390 
can see the alpha of what's actually
being<00:02:01.760> shown<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.240> here<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:02.950> that's<00:02:03.950> kind<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.250> a

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
being shown in here and that's kind of a

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.760 
being shown in here and that's kind of a
nice<00:02:04.580> because<00:02:05.000> basically<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:05.510> can<00:02:05.659> preview<00:02:06.260> how

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
nice because basically I can preview how

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.160 
nice because basically I can preview how
well<00:02:06.980> this<00:02:07.190> thing<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.460> going<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.880> composite<00:02:08.869> if

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
well this thing is going to composite if

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.009 
well this thing is going to composite if
there's<00:02:09.470> any<00:02:09.739> strange<00:02:10.039> artifact<00:02:10.550> etc<00:02:11.090> with

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
there's any strange artifact etc with

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.809 
there's any strange artifact etc with
fur<00:02:12.319> for<00:02:12.650> example<00:02:13.069> it's<00:02:13.220> always<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> good<00:02:13.760> idea

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
fur for example it's always a good idea

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.490 
fur for example it's always a good idea
to<00:02:14.270> sort<00:02:14.780> of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
to sort of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.650 
to sort of
check<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.830> make<00:02:15.950> sure<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.460> have<00:02:16.850> nice<00:02:17.180> good

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
check to make sure you have nice good

check to make sure you have nice good
clean<00:02:17.690> alphas<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> another<00:02:20.900> thing<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
clean alphas so another thing that you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.070 
clean alphas so another thing that you
can<00:02:21.380> do<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.970> if<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.240> right<00:02:23.390> click<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:23.900> for

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
can do is if you right click on here for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.810 
can do is if you right click on here for
example<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.560> can<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.890> ahead<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.220> composite

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
example I can go ahead and composite

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.780 
example I can go ahead and composite
that<00:02:25.940> over<00:02:26.240> blue<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.350> can<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.890> about<00:02:28.460> how

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that over blue and I can see about how

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.840 
that over blue and I can see about how
my<00:02:28.940> health<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.330> looking<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.890> clip<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.370> can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
my health is looking on this clip I can

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.900 
my health is looking on this clip I can
also<00:02:32.000> go<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.420> here<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.500> open<00:02:34.430> up<00:02:34.760> this

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
also go in here and I can open up this

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.060 
also go in here and I can open up this
whole<00:02:35.120> set<00:02:35.420> new<00:02:35.630> set<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.930> menus<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.890> can

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
whole set new set of menus and I can

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.920 
whole set new set of menus and I can
check<00:02:37.250> out<00:02:37.430> my<00:02:37.640> different<00:02:38.000> primo<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.570> like<00:02:38.750> for

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
check out my different primo so like for

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.110 
check out my different primo so like for
example<00:02:39.020> here<00:02:39.650> I'm<00:02:40.550> actually<00:02:40.820> getting

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
example here I'm actually getting

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.600 
example here I'm actually getting
probably<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.990> proper<00:02:42.440> alpha<00:02:42.770> for<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.160> this

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
probably a proper alpha for this this

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.770 
probably a proper alpha for this this
fur<00:02:44.420> if<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:44.930> wasn't<00:02:45.280> pre<00:02:46.280> molted<00:02:46.640> correctly<00:02:47.150> I

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
fur if it wasn't pre molted correctly I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.020 
fur if it wasn't pre molted correctly I
can<00:02:48.350> actually<00:02:48.470> see<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.310> harsh<00:02:49.640> black

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
can actually see this this harsh black

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.540 
can actually see this this harsh black
line<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.989> would<00:02:51.110> happen<00:02:51.320> from<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.860> from<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
line that would happen from the from the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.180 
line that would happen from the from the
normal<00:02:52.970> alpha<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.930> pre<00:02:54.350> molting<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.830> Alpha<00:02:55.160> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
normal alpha so pre molting the Alpha is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.720 
normal alpha so pre molting the Alpha is
a<00:02:55.310> good<00:02:55.459> way<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:57.500> work<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.580> can

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
a good way to to work with it so you can

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.430 
a good way to to work with it so you can
just<00:02:58.760> slip<00:02:59.570> through<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.900> different<00:03:00.200> alpha

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
just slip through the different alpha

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.720 
just slip through the different alpha
modes<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.739> can<00:03:00.800> actually<00:03:01.160> even<00:03:01.280> slip<00:03:01.550> through

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
modes you can actually even slip through

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.130 
modes you can actually even slip through
transparency<00:03:02.270> if<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.480> want<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.720> make<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.989> more

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
transparency if you want to make it more

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.260 
transparency if you want to make it more
transparent<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.370> actually<00:03:04.520> works<00:03:04.880> in<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
transparent so it actually works in a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.240 
transparent so it actually works in a
basic<00:03:05.780> layer<00:03:06.050> manner<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.709> same<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.100> that

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
basic layer manner in the same way that

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.330 
basic layer manner in the same way that
you<00:03:07.400> would<00:03:07.430> see<00:03:07.760> from<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.770> basic<00:03:09.770> compositing

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
you would see from a basic compositing

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.180 
you would see from a basic compositing
package<00:03:10.730> which<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.030> kind<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.300> nice<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.860> I<00:03:13.010> can

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
package which is kind of nice and I can

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.410 
package which is kind of nice and I can
go<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.489> here<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.120> actually

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
go in here and I can is actually

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.310 
go in here and I can is actually
selected<00:03:14.840> l<00:03:14.989> /<00:03:15.350> green<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:17.020> even<00:03:18.020> white

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
selected l / green or even white

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.259 
selected l / green or even white
sometimes<00:03:18.680> white<00:03:19.220> reveals<00:03:19.430> some<00:03:19.970> things<00:03:20.180> that

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
sometimes white reveals some things that

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.759 
sometimes white reveals some things that
I<00:03:20.390> want<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.630> see<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:24.049> actually<00:03:24.200> kind<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.620> a

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
I want to see so it's actually kind of a

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.449 
I want to see so it's actually kind of a
nice<00:03:25.670> way<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.970> looking<00:03:26.450> at<00:03:26.540> things<00:03:27.459> or

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
nice way of looking at things or

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.070 
nice way of looking at things or
actually<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.209> over<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.420> checker<00:03:29.600> pattern<00:03:29.810> I've

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
actually I over to checker pattern I've

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.210 
actually I over to checker pattern I've
second<00:03:30.350> pattern<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:30.680> actually<00:03:30.890> pretty<00:03:31.010> good

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
second pattern it's actually pretty good

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.250 
second pattern it's actually pretty good
because<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.209> see<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> motion<00:03:32.900> over

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
because it you can see the motion over

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.740 
because it you can see the motion over
the<00:03:33.380> pattern<00:03:34.040> as<00:03:34.190> well<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.090> all<00:03:35.120> these<00:03:35.690> things

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
the pattern as well so all these things

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.759 
the pattern as well so all these things
are<00:03:36.620> very<00:03:37.010> revealing<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:38.410> start<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.500> reveal

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
are very revealing of start to reveal

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.320 
are very revealing of start to reveal
somebody<00:03:40.130> underbelly<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.580> what<00:03:40.820> P<00:03:40.940> player<00:03:41.239> is

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
somebody underbelly of what P player is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.819 
somebody underbelly of what P player is
actually<00:03:41.630> capable<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:42.140> doing<00:03:44.200> ok<00:03:45.200> so<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:45.709> that

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
actually capable of doing ok so now that

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.680 
actually capable of doing ok so now that
I've<00:03:45.980> talked<00:03:46.489> about<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.880> let's<00:03:47.150> let's<00:03:47.510> sort

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
I've talked about that let's let's sort

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.630 
I've talked about that let's let's sort
of<00:03:47.750> go<00:03:47.900> through<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.260> next<00:03:48.440> scenario<00:03:48.829> which

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
of go through the next scenario which

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.740 
of go through the next scenario which
would<00:03:49.940> be<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.480> put<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.980> CG<00:03:52.610> element<00:03:52.640> over<00:03:53.450> a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
would be to put a CG element over a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.020 
would be to put a CG element over a
plate<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:55.040> that's<00:03:55.130> very<00:03:55.430> common<00:03:55.700> you

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
plate and that's very common you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.240 
plate and that's very common you
basically<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:57.170> my<00:03:57.380> industry<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.010> visual

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
basically in my industry in the visual

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.940 
basically in my industry in the visual
effects<00:03:58.519> industry<00:03:59.079> what<00:04:00.079> I<00:04:00.110> like<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.470> do<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.650> I

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
effects industry what I like to do is I

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.550 
effects industry what I like to do is I
have<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.280> put<00:04:01.459> some<00:04:01.700> CG<00:04:02.150> element<00:04:02.390> over<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.079> plate

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
have to put some CG element over a plate

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.860 
have to put some CG element over a plate
or<00:04:03.709> sometimes<00:04:04.519> even<00:04:04.730> a<00:04:04.940> CG<00:04:05.269> element<00:04:05.299> over

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
or sometimes even a CG element over

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.449 
or sometimes even a CG element over
another<00:04:06.110> CG<00:04:06.440> element<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:07.070> sort<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.250> see

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
another CG element and just sort of see

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.520 
another CG element and just sort of see
how<00:04:07.579> that<00:04:07.790> works<00:04:08.000> together<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:09.049> I'm<00:04:09.350> going<00:04:09.500> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
how that works together so I'm going to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.060 
how that works together so I'm going to
go<00:04:09.680> ahead<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:10.150> delete<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.829> you'll

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
go ahead and delete this and you'll

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.340 
go ahead and delete this and you'll
notice<00:04:13.280> your<00:04:13.519> PD<00:04:14.060> player<00:04:14.329> actually<00:04:14.540> works<00:04:14.930> you

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
notice your PD player actually works you

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.569 
notice your PD player actually works you

basically showing this a pan across this
planet<00:04:53.690> here<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:55.340> next<00:04:55.460> thing<00:04:55.699> i<00:04:55.819> can<00:04:56.000> do

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
planet here and the next thing i can do

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.680 
planet here and the next thing i can do
is<00:04:56.180> i<00:04:56.449> can<00:04:56.479> load<00:04:56.750> up<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.050> satellite<00:04:57.470> shot<00:04:57.830> and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
is i can load up this satellite shot and

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.820 
is i can load up this satellite shot and
that's<00:04:59.690> going<00:04:59.930> to<00:04:59.990> go<00:05:00.110> ahead<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.349> load<00:05:00.590> i'm

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
that's going to go ahead and load i'm

that's going to go ahead and load i'm
going<00:05:01.009> to<00:05:01.069> go<00:05:01.129> ahead<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.430> pause<00:05:01.580> again<00:05:01.819> saudi

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
going to go ahead and pause again saudi

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.659 
going to go ahead and pause again saudi
it<00:05:02.750> will<00:05:02.870> just<00:05:03.050> load<00:05:03.289> up<00:05:03.319> and<00:05:04.310> I've<00:05:04.460> now

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
it will just load up and I've now

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.760 
it will just load up and I've now
basically<00:05:05.060> loaded<00:05:05.629> my<00:05:05.810> two<00:05:05.870> clips<00:05:06.409> I'm<00:05:06.620> going

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
basically loaded my two clips I'm going

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.619 
basically loaded my two clips I'm going
to<00:05:06.830> go<00:05:06.919> ahead<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.280> hide<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.639> information

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
to go ahead and hide this information

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.649 
to go ahead and hide this information
bar<00:05:09.469> here<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.129> I<00:05:10.400> can<00:05:10.610> basically<00:05:10.759> hit<00:05:11.629> the

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
bar here and I can basically hit the

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.300 
bar here and I can basically hit the
play<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.139> you'll<00:05:12.319> see<00:05:12.530> it's<00:05:12.770> basically<00:05:13.190> a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
play and you'll see it's basically a

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.600 
play and you'll see it's basically a
satellite<00:05:14.270> that's<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:15.379> over<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:16.009> planet<00:05:16.430> and

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
satellite that's going over a planet and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.119 
satellite that's going over a planet and
its<00:05:16.759> composited<00:05:17.419> together<00:05:17.719> a<00:05:17.960> over<00:05:18.650> B<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.039> if

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
its composited together a over B and if

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.529 
its composited together a over B and if
you<00:05:19.190> know<00:05:19.310> believe<00:05:19.759> me<00:05:19.789> I<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.210> just<00:05:20.300> turn<00:05:20.479> that

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
you know believe me I can just turn that

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.240 
you know believe me I can just turn that
off<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.080> you<00:05:21.110> can<00:05:21.500> see<00:05:21.710> that<00:05:21.740> basically

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
off and on you can see that basically

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.170 
off and on you can see that basically
I've<00:05:22.520> got<00:05:22.699> my<00:05:22.879> a<00:05:22.909> over<00:05:23.300> B<00:05:23.710> playing<00:05:24.909> one<00:05:25.909> on<00:05:25.940> top

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
I've got my a over B playing one on top

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.020 
I've got my a over B playing one on top
of<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> other<00:05:26.419> which<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:26.990> very<00:05:27.319> useful<00:05:27.909> to<00:05:28.909> be

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
of the other which is very useful to be

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.209 
of the other which is very useful to be
able<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.389> play<00:05:30.169> those<00:05:30.380> things<00:05:30.680> together<00:05:30.830> and

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
able to play those things together and

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.920 
able to play those things together and
just<00:05:31.520> have<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.849> ram<00:05:32.029> player<00:05:32.300> take<00:05:32.539> care<00:05:32.779> of

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
just have the ram player take care of

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.290 
just have the ram player take care of
the<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:34.069> compositing<00:05:34.669> for<00:05:34.969> me<00:05:36.940> now<00:05:37.940> with<00:05:38.150> that

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
the the compositing for me now with that

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.439 
the the compositing for me now with that
being<00:05:38.360> said<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:39.710> basically<00:05:40.699> have<00:05:41.029> an<00:05:41.120> idea<00:05:41.360> of

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449
