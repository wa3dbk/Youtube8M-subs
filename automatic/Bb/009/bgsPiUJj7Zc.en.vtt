00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.850
 Halle is my life if he does not call it meant Tradings Münster 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.890
 opposite 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.960
 as the DAX "Sarah and I think that you are afraid have something else 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.179
 Preparatory work go on tour 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.429
 and they have always worked beautifully on the beautiful weather 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.569
 and I thought so I'll show it now », said Fidelity 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.949
 It's really not that easy to be around the next cell phone 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.259
 Just run away from it is a solution so if it still worked 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.370
 then that's also true 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.370
 but off 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.060
 At that time our third was to do that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.300
 The tasting says initially 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.250
 the verdict in which he explains that would make happy if it 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.040
 really launched it is very nice 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.090
 I've just found that it works great too 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.340
 once a majority Zeitgeist to one he has what he needs for it so I 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.110
 I've got it myself better and birth 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.770
 I have a tremendous study so Buchner that is but much expensive was Roland 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.439
 Steiner one clearly says that one fear 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.719
 because as well as the orchestra over it has tested and that works 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.690
 also very cool 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.140
 and not even if it is at 10 o'clock in the city hall in the picture 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.750
 absence 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.200
 during the first the product in the text field the local parts like that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 is working 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.730
 good as now 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 it is in the test 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.300
 The Road Again Beat Never Something's Right There's Everything Needed So 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.910
 the most important thing really every year 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.110
 and we have not bought in yet this is the name we have removed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.600
 finally need the template 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.219
 Stands will be back against skiing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.230
 Of course you must know Ina Benad benefit you should not accept 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.820
 because even 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.980
 so will be in the second part 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.660
 is he 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.880
 this is how he looks like 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.160
 Dr 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.890
 So he acquired the Ski Bochum to St by the very nice with me 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.290
 Hunting tenants tell what memories 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.660
 from Danielle black in the markets and the app is committed to that 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.730
 only one but that does not matter 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.609
 Meppen, he also does not look pretty 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.749
 union internally 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.989
 but serve without 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.290
 Mesum music which from the different motives introduce the taste what 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.519
 This produces steel Brunner grinder 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.449
 macn so as I said everything 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.499
 and being the only one to wrinkle it up 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.499
 the HSI to Corinth the template 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.450
 the name was the service of the countries 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.180
 he is extra for that one needs from those with black and green also in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.299
 Hesse too 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.840
 and then I go out of my studio in these communities 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.839
 this is how he looks like 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.799
 in Mainz so I think personally you know you have beautiful work 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.779
 the rule that tastes different 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.009
 and it costs a bit more now I have to live in my life then 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.729
 at 4 to 5 euros high 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.019
 Linden GBP 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:12.109
 and he from yesterday he is cheaper the cost a euro 114 he a normal 90 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.219
 I'm not sure now Niedermeyer is writing this in 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.869
 the info box 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:20.340
 without us saying so I thought so 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.709
 the response was - and then mostly dare more in the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 branches 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.760
 that was never like the Nigerians 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.429
 Petersen's junk is taken 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.029
 the hand 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:36.779
 this statement is that go on the area too 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.449
 Index finger May 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.669
 show how this works 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.199
 Seoul Franz says Lieselotte right 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.579
 a motive 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.829
 I decide now just for the Ticino 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.829
 and into the forest 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:58.369
 No thanks only 16 4 Apple already had manic drives it always a bit 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.719
 Exhaust gases in the weight too much 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.049
 Percent thanks 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.450
 disputed about the both about the motive that you get out of there 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.989
 after the race in South Korea 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.639
 and thus the St his goal 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.969
 So you can always be more with him in the four points in the previous month 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.159
 where do you go over it over the subject 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.159
 Michel Carnal 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.490
 they became a stamp 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.180
 and at least see that motion kid 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.240
 And then they finally had their customers trust the first one 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.599
 Sneezing is off this year 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.599
 then you have to demolish it again in recent years 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 We did it again, so I go with it 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.810
 No I have to say that honestly there is something faster but how 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.810
 You just have to be patient 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.889
 I just manage to manage it a bit faster 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.889
 Bottrop can work 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.379
 Niewerth strip racer in the first team 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.470
 with gays and lesbians 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.120
 Highstreet wants 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.120
 these objects 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.120
 something like that works 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 the former number 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.569
 pick up in the taxi 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:24.749
 November 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.870
 how do you pull that down significantly? 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.870
 watch 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.650
 Mang Canada is unfortunately not the bet I have to apologize again 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.180
 So the number is now quite faithful "I know it's me" meant 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.479
 Presley behind Vettel 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.669
 how can you send a midfield place this time? 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.199
 but you know them a little bit but you can not be the best as a little one » 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.669
 "I also like to treat ManU with her 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.139
 according to the will of his mother and son of hers 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.710
 and if you push that very interesting market then that is 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.380
 also yesterday third thank you guys in their limits find one another 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.150
 make a welcoming impression 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.150
 and if that turns out great 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.470
 Musicians do nothing to pity 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.960
 As I said, maybe I have to invest more money this year again 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.569
 get them better camera 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.360
 but he thinks she did these 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.770
 This condition once again in the slow clarify now seeks you 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.900
 Motive 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.600
 Now complain says Chen stripping so he does not bother too much on the stencil code 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.639
 then delete the motive I take Blankenheim 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:46.319
 forfeited his forehead 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.319
 with the slogan who is doing her second child 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.719
 Give stalls 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:55.909
 why ask 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.180
 and then the motive of the three main roles could still be that 

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.669
 finalists 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.490
 the IOC has a judge next 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.990
 if you have questions 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.509
 can you like me 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.470
 the Basler I am twice visited the previous sink 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.509
 January in two and a half years again 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.509
 He will stay with it for another test 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:18.569
 No it is important and that is patience 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.790
 Keys Raich on the way really needed 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.470
 but also cheaper is not afraid I am looking forward to your opinions 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.010
 Comments and the therapy does not fade
