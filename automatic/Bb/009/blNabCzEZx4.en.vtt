00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.420
 well guys welcome inside 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.620
 this box ingo below the lens the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.809
 cover buddy of his 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.610
 of which I spoke to you in the previous video 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.410
 related to the iPad was its accessories 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.779
 it's the case for the part 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.180
 rear that fits the smart 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.099
 cover a note just before doing 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.360
 unboxing ordered custody on 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.399
 American suicide store is actually 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.720
 I also decided on a store in Europe that I am 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.460
 Germany 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.780
 I had already made this mistake of 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.910
 order by mistake on the American site 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.649
 the first time and at the time they blocked me 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.309
 the order precisely indicating the store 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.079
 European 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.149
 this time they have me anyway 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.800
 sent the package from america because vi 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.199
 I repeat, I was really wrong again 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.749
 I ended up on that site by mistake it is 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.510
 the package left on 19 Wednesday the 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:58.609
 19 February arrived in Italy from 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.249
 trekking us ps on Wednesday 26 and some 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.769
 of 26 arrived today and Monday at home 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:06.080
 strange thing is that however usually the 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.450
 American trading number is there anyway 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
 an international registered letter comes 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.040
 the system should be traced 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.590
 Italian post open the thing comes to 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.300
 buffet that usps actually signaled to me 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 that the package had arrived in Italy but 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.050
 I can Italian lama start to trace 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.490
 fortunately the same arrived but 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.950
 if not, it still hasn't been 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.330
 the king reactivated in his italy 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 good thing they did n't stop me in 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.200
 customs also because fortunately they have 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.540
 declared that the value of the 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.380
 cover was just two dollars anyway 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.930
 continue the unboxing proceed 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.690
 unboxing hoping it arrived 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 whole in the sixth a similar journey is not 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.260
 just the best 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.640
 then see 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:03.369
 ok buddy suicide cover for ipad and ultra 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.679
 slim a millimeter and 8 that thick 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.069
 is added to the ipad and then okay here 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.230
 in short, all the various are specified 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.819
 protections in the corners etc. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.250
 also the fact that it is resistant to 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.230
 Scratches are usually not really true 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:24.239
 however you will see it seems to have been 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:32.380
 even the hooks are used 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:35.980
 let's go open them I hate this this 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:41.769
 so they have to impact the stuff from 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:52.450
 one thing that bothers me perhaps there 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:03:01.209
 I succeeded here here now avoiding 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:03.239
 then destroy it for ipad and let's go 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.549
 what they give us inside was a film 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.660
 no yes then the police 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.090
 plastic applicator in short 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.720
 Assembly instructions 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.760
 then there are the various holes for the for 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.609
 cover the lightning that is the various caps 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.060
 for lighting and for the jack of the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:27.489
 headphones and we also have the film that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.489
 hitches I don't use but having one is not 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.109
 never a bad thing 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.620
 and here is the very simple case and 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.630
 transparent as you can see here at 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.269
 all the carvings necessary to 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.880
 operation also for headphones 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.680
 seems to me done quite well and not there 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.139
 they are macro holes but simply 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.680
 have recreated the texture here is all there is 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.010
 opening on the side for insertion 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.260
 of the smart cover hole for the microphone 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.819
 another hole much wider for the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.890
 microphone 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.459
 the to the space for the insertion of the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.049
 headphones and camera here does a bit of 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.120
 fatigue admits because transparent and 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.249
 beyond that the one for the camera 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.629
 is the one for the volume arrived at 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:15.969
 take live that is here I give him one 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.190
 clean final had already prepared before 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:23.470
 right to the logo because what then 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.949
 will see more is spotted ok and ed 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.310
 let's go and insert it there is a first one 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.759
 side on this side here we go to do 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.780
 a minimum of pressure and then we finish by 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:43.830
 this side right side shown 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:48.160
 perfect has been inserted really has 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.860
 well as I expected anyway because i 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.770
 holes fit perfectly like 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.009
 you can also see here the one of the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.160
 headphones comes out fine 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.490
 same thing for the lightning connector 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.490
 old fire 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.220
 here is the only part of the logo cover 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.440
 father who then at the end on the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.240
 slot for the sim sim the space for 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.940
 access the buttons then let's go to 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.830
 take a smart cover 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.830
 here we find the green 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:30.930
 perfectly compatible as you can 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:34.030
 see here here is how you can see 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:38.550
 there is no extra space or so there is 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.550
 just the one for the movement is open 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.099
 perfect magnet in short suffers from 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.280
 weight of the cover itself also because 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.050
 now there is a little more thickness 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:55.630
 all in all a nice feeling itself 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:58.229
 what the red one here is even more 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.229
 beautiful red pole 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 as you can see everything perfectly 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.090
 compatible so I just have to 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.360
 greet you 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.840
 and give you the next video at that moment 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.840
 Hi everyone
