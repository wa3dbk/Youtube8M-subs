they're there and I was looking at a lot

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.490 
they're there and I was looking at a lot
of<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.440> bikes<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.950> comes<00:00:44.190> stock<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.520> HID

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
of other bikes that comes stock with HID

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
of other bikes that comes stock with HID
projectors<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.399> them<00:00:47.489> don't<00:00:47.579> even

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
projectors and most of them don't even

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.680 
projectors and most of them don't even
have<00:00:47.850> angel<00:00:48.360> eyes<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.890> not<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.390> big<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> deal

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
have angel eyes so not that big a deal

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.340 
have angel eyes so not that big a deal
but<00:00:52.320> anyway<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.600> new<00:00:54.750> front<00:00:55.140> end

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
but anyway there's the the new front end

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
but anyway there's the the new front end
and<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.160> must<00:00:56.399> say<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and I must say really like the way it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:16.960 
and I must say really like the way it
looks<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.160> will<00:00:59.160> fire<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.699> up

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.190 

there's<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.270> braids

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:47.300 

slowly

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.800 

so<00:01:48.310> there<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.549> go<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:49.780> in<00:01:50.049> all<00:01:50.200> probably

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so there you go all in all probably

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.740 
so there you go all in all probably
almost<00:01:52.810> ten<00:01:53.080> hours<00:01:53.439> just<00:01:54.070> for<00:01:54.369> all<00:01:54.490> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
almost ten hours just for all the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.100 
almost ten hours just for all the
screwing<00:01:55.750> around<00:01:55.840> with<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:58.110> was

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
screwing around with it and I was

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.929 
screwing around with it and I was
actually<00:01:59.259> quite<00:01:59.560> surprised<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.250> side

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
actually quite surprised that side

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.990 
actually quite surprised that side
panels<00:02:01.390> went<00:02:01.659> in<00:02:02.310> without<00:02:03.310> any<00:02:03.640> extra

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
panels went in without any extra

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.469 
panels went in without any extra
modification<00:02:07.080> which<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.229> kind<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.470> nice

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
modification which is kind of nice

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.610 
modification which is kind of nice
considering<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.660> left<00:02:10.840> side<00:02:11.050> here's<00:02:11.380> got

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
considering the left side here's got

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.979 
considering the left side here's got
into<00:02:12.130> Stiebel<00:02:12.430> horn<00:02:12.819> a<00:02:13.060> ballast<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
into Stiebel horn a ballast and the

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.380 
into Stiebel horn a ballast and the
controller<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.860> plus<00:02:15.819> all<00:02:16.000> my<00:02:16.030> additional

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
controller and plus all my additional

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.460 
controller and plus all my additional
wiring<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.080> relays<00:02:17.380> for<00:02:18.120> my<00:02:19.200> watson<00:02:20.200> flush

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
wiring and relays for my watson flush

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.520 
wiring and relays for my watson flush
mounts<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:22.120> quite<00:02:22.390> full<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.500> I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
mounts there so it's quite full so I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.050 
mounts there so it's quite full so I
think<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.100> safe<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.250> say<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.640> my<00:02:24.790> last

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
think it's safe to say is my last

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.920 
think it's safe to say is my last
electrical<00:02:25.690> mod<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.040> bike<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.970> don't

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
electrical mod to this bike I just don't

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930 
electrical mod to this bike I just don't
want<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.260> any<00:02:29.410> more<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:30.459> don't<00:02:30.489> have<00:02:30.790> any

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
want to do any more they don't have any

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.620 
want to do any more they don't have any
more<00:02:31.090> room<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.680> anyway<00:02:32.680> there<00:02:32.860> she<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
more room so anyway there she is if you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.300 
more room so anyway there she is if you
want<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.840> give<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.110> mod<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> shot<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.730> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
want to give this mod a shot it's a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.860 
want to give this mod a shot it's a
fairly<00:02:39.310> intense<00:02:39.760> mod<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.360> probably<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fairly intense mod it's probably the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.580 
fairly intense mod it's probably the
biggest<00:02:41.620> mod<00:02:41.950> I've<00:02:42.519> done<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.970> my<00:02:43.090> bike<00:02:43.590> just

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
biggest mod I've done to my bike just

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.370 
biggest mod I've done to my bike just
for<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.370> terms<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.150> taking<00:02:46.390> things<00:02:46.630> apart<00:02:46.810> and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
for in terms of taking things apart and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.900 
for in terms of taking things apart and
electrical<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:50.260> yeah<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> price<00:02:51.489> not

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
electrical but yeah for the price not

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.590 
electrical but yeah for the price not
bad<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.920> know<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.579> will<00:02:55.329> pay<00:02:55.570> off

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
bad and you know I think it will pay off

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.239 
bad and you know I think it will pay off
so<00:02:56.109> there<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.190> go<00:02:57.310> good<00:02:58.030> luck
