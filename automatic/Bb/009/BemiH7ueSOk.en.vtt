so<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.180> go<00:02:50.389> with<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.540> shadow<00:02:50.780> ball<00:02:51.049> since<00:02:51.470> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
so I go with the shadow ball since I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.500 
so I go with the shadow ball since I
would<00:02:51.739> speed<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:53.090> does<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.269> lot<00:02:53.450> of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
would speed it and it does a lot of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.720 
would speed it and it does a lot of
damage<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.049> Infernape<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> he<00:02:55.430> tries<00:02:55.700> to
