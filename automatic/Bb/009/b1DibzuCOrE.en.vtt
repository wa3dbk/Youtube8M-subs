00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
not do that celestial alignment has

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
not do that celestial alignment has
changed<00:00:28.500> since<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.849> tried<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
changed since I first tried it out on

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100 
changed since I first tried it out on
the<00:00:31.080> PTR<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.219> still<00:00:32.790> pauses<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> Eclipse<00:00:33.750> but

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the PTR it still pauses the Eclipse but

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.280 
the PTR it still pauses the Eclipse but
it<00:00:34.230> gives<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.680> both<00:00:35.329> lunar<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.540> solar<00:00:36.840> peaks

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it gives you both lunar and solar peaks

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.150 
it gives you both lunar and solar peaks
at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.680> what<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> told<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
at the same time so what I told you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
at the same time so what I told you
basically<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.879> look<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.570> need<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
basically is look you need to get to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
basically is look you need to get to
lunar<00:00:43.770> peak<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.340> pop<00:00:44.579> CA<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.989> your

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
lunar peak then pop CA and then do your

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
lunar peak then pop CA and then do your
worst<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.280> correct<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
worst that is not correct that is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.299 
worst that is not correct that is
incorrect<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.309> I<00:00:50.309> felt<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.690> about<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
incorrect and I felt so about that

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
incorrect and I felt so about that
when<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.670> corrected<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> comments<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
when I got corrected in the comments I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
when I got corrected in the comments I
was<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.379> holy<00:00:56.010> people<00:00:56.879> are<00:00:56.969> gonna

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
about the haste versus mastery thing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
about the haste versus mastery thing
what<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> might<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.650> better

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
what it might be for me I have better

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.179 
what it might be for me I have better
performance<00:01:32.189> when<00:01:32.880> fully<00:01:33.479> gyming<00:01:33.930> haste<00:01:34.229> but

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
performance when fully gyming haste but

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
performance when fully gyming haste but
that<00:01:35.340> might<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.210> was<00:01:36.509> fairly

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that might be because I was fairly

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.010 
that might be because I was fairly
unlucky<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> 5.4<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> items<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.840> I

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
unlucky in 5.4 with the items that I

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
unlucky in 5.4 with the items that I
have<00:01:40.140> acquired<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> items<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
have acquired and the items that have

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
have acquired and the items that have
dropped<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.930> almost<00:01:43.110> sixty<00:01:43.619> percent

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
dropped so I have almost sixty percent

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.440 
dropped so I have almost sixty percent
mastery<00:01:44.899> okay<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.799> maybe<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.090> why

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
mastery okay so that's maybe that's why

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.929 
mastery okay so that's maybe that's why
haze<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.380> beneficial<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
haze is more beneficial to me because I

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.200 
haze is more beneficial to me because I
have<00:01:51.090> enough<00:01:51.360> mastery<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> spell<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
have enough mastery so the spell so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
have enough mastery so the spell so
the<00:01:54.329> spells<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.869> strong<00:01:55.259> enough<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the spells are strong enough and I can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.359 
the spells are strong enough and I can
get<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:57.350> near<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> peak<00:01:58.740> with

get more of them off near the peak with
all<00:01:59.610> these<00:01:59.939> haste<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.600> maybe<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> want<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> go

all these haste so maybe you want to go
hybrid<00:02:02.100> mastery<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.790> haste<00:02:03.000> maybe<00:02:03.270> you're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
hybrid mastery in haste maybe you're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.139 
hybrid mastery in haste maybe you're
gonna<00:02:03.540> want<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:03.960> full<00:02:04.200> face<00:02:04.520> okay<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.790> maybe

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
gonna want to go full face okay or maybe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
gonna want to go full face okay or maybe
you<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.540> for<00:02:06.689> mastery<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.340> don't<00:02:08.340> know

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you want to go for mastery I don't know

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.690 
you want to go for mastery I don't know
what<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.569> correct<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:11.160> rotation

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
what I want to correct is the rotation

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.350 
what I want to correct is the rotation
and<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.480> more<00:02:13.020> importantly<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.709> opening

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and more more importantly the opening

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.869 
and more more importantly the opening
it's<00:02:15.360> not<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.599> rotation<00:02:16.170> per<00:02:16.410> se<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:17.790> you

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
it's not the rotation per se so what you

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.119 
it's not the rotation per se so what you
want<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.379> is<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.770> pre<00:02:19.950> cast

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
want to do is you want to pre cast

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.890 
want to do is you want to pre cast

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
to put the moon fire up so I have to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.990 
to put the moon fire up so I have to
remove<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> last<00:02:46.620> star<00:02:47.040> search<00:02:47.280> put<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.819> moon

star search after such alignment has
worn<00:02:56.190> off<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.310> proper<00:02:59.640> way<00:02:59.760> and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790

Search because Star Search first of all

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.690 
Search because Star Search first of all
does<00:03:03.629> more<00:03:03.870> damage<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.409> its<00:03:05.069> spell<00:03:05.400> storm

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
does more damage and its spell storm

at the same time with celestial

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.350 
at the same time with celestial
alignment<00:03:14.129> it<00:03:14.370> will<00:03:14.610> buff<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.120> Star

Starfire<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:47.510> dots<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.840> was<00:03:49.290> not<00:03:49.440> able<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
Starfire and dots I was not able to

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.490 
Starfire and dots I was not able to
squeeze<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.430> last<00:03:50.549> Starfire<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:52.319> that's

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
squeeze the last Starfire in but that's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.920 
squeeze the last Starfire in but that's
not<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:53.010> big<00:03:53.069> deal<00:03:54.019> okay<00:03:55.250> it's<00:03:56.250> not<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.610> big<00:03:56.790> deal

not a big deal okay it's not a big deal

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.429 
not a big deal okay it's not a big deal
why<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.860> these<00:03:59.010> dots<00:03:59.689> have<00:04:00.689> a<00:04:00.720> very<00:04:01.170> long
