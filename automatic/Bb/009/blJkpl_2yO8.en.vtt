I think that this this purple man became
a<00:02:40.629> lunatic<00:02:41.079> as<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.379> kid<00:02:41.560> that's<00:02:41.739> why<00:02:41.920> yellow

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
a lunatic as the kid that's why yellow

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.920 
a lunatic as the kid that's why yellow
dresses<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.670> purple<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.180> cool<00:02:43.599> stuff<00:02:43.810> like

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.119 
to be a nightmare I really do believe
that<00:02:59.079> but<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.409> essentially<00:02:59.769> I<00:02:59.799> think<00:02:59.829> that

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
that but I essentially I think that

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.170 
that but I essentially I think that
after<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.459> nightmare<00:03:00.909> of<00:03:00.940> these

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
after this nightmare of these

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.640 
after this nightmare of these

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
cool stuff like that I think purple

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.149 
cool stuff like that I think purple

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
it's very very sad to be honest but this

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.740 
it's very very sad to be honest but this
is<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.879> where<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> start<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.629> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
is like this is where the start of the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.819 
actually never does hurt foxy and the
reason<00:03:43.269> for<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:44.049> believe<00:03:44.349> is<00:03:44.590> because

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
reason for that I do believe is because

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.650 
reason for that I do believe is because
Fox<00:03:45.099> he's<00:03:45.340> actually<00:03:45.579> in<00:03:45.879> purple<00:03:46.269> man's<00:03:46.419> closet

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
Fox he's actually in purple man's closet

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.240 
Fox he's actually in purple man's closet
he's<00:03:46.989> like<00:03:47.169> purple<00:03:47.470> man's<00:03:47.620> Savior<00:03:48.099> his

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
he's like purple man's Savior his

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.400 
he's like purple man's Savior his
protector<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.000> he<00:03:49.720> definitely<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.230> took

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
protector and he definitely like took

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.930 
protector and he definitely like took
care<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.650> purple<00:03:51.160> man<00:03:51.280> when<00:03:51.459> he<00:03:51.519> was<00:03:51.639> younger<00:03:51.819> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
care of purple man when he was younger I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.369 
care of purple man when he was younger I
guess<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.239> could<00:03:52.329> say<00:03:52.359> and<00:03:52.780> cool<00:03:53.139> stuff<00:03:53.349> like

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
guess you could say and cool stuff like

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.390 
guess you could say and cool stuff like
that<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.739> think<00:03:53.889> he's<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.099> his<00:03:54.190> closet

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
that so I think he's in his closet

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.550 
that so I think he's in his closet
actually<00:03:54.699> and<00:03:55.090> when<00:03:55.540> purple<00:03:56.019> man<00:03:56.139> is<00:03:56.260> having

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
actually and when purple man is having

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.659
