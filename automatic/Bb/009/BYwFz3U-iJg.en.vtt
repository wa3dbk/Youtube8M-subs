00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.470
 the last trip at the end of April at the end 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.210
 of the month of April we received an invitation 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.940
 to witness a great exercise 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.940
 scale as observers that if you go to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.289
 develop 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.289
 the county of virginia 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.130
 in the regional area of the us americas 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.900
 It is the only country that has approved 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.270
 under united nations rescue groups 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.010
 medium and heavy at the international level 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.080
 united nations- these groups are required 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.380
 international rescue every five 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.590
 years a reclassification test for 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.899
 see if they have their skills 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.990
 and its logistics levels suitable for 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.609
 national sales in view of the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.979
 classification that was going to be the team of 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:27.149
 virginia which is the forces team of 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.619
 number one task in the us in 2016 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.929
 this year they did a great exercise 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 three- day scale to which 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.890
 we were invited as observers 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 at the regional level, he invited several 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.260
 countries of the region we are talking about 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.170
 the entire region of the Americas between 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.600
 they had people from groups use from Peru 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.010
 from mexico de chile 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 and in the Argentine commission 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.090
 now that it was a very nice experience 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 since we could meet with firemen 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 of worldwide great powers 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.230
 where good was not given to be able 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:21.360
 measure us also at what point we were 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:24.360
 worldwide, the simulation was 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.100
 of different rescue exercises in 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.020
 collapsed structures did not have to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.330
 develop shoring access to 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.360
 confined spaces with tools 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.489
 penetration also mocks 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
 Rescue work of vehicles in 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.519
 Collapsed with damaged highways 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.519
 structural 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.329
 during the exercise that had a 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.859
 duration of three days and they were developed 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.049
 the activities simultaneously in 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.980
 different places that we can 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.560
 participate as observers of all 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.810
 these activities the deployment 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.220
 logistics and also the operational part 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.680
 they can be very close 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.200
 and good power to compare if our 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.850
 I work here in Argentina as we 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.520
 an answer we give an answer to 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.590
 national level at the moment yes but 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.730
 it could be a comparison and have a 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.730
 projection towards the future 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.819
 well we saw that they worked in 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.819
 four different scenarios 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.910
 they can calmly touch us 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.940
 U.S 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.270
 in our national territory as 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.070
 envy I think we do not have anything 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.140
 envy the other powers in what 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.880
 it is raw material there is a very good 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.270
 raw material that has been working 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.140
 with the staff in this institution yes 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.060
 perhaps being great powers have 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.810
 a different logistics perhaps to the 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.540
 our but that we are not far 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:26.030
 neither of being able to achieve it according to 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:29.870
 a national coordination office to 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.080
 operational level we work almost 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.830
 just like them 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.949
 Maybe we are more Latino and 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 we are perhaps blood warmer to the 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.569
 time to work with the victims 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.789
 we even made some 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.340
 observations according to the work that 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.069
 I was doing there he had certain 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.319
 veedores that took it and well we 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.909
 they gave the reason that what we 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.949
 we were saying in those observations 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.870
 we were right and that made us very 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:03.189
 happy because it was encouraging for him 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:06.190
 group know that we are at the level of a 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:08.340
 power level of how Argentines much 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.340
 pride 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.830
 because
