00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
right now so it seems perhaps this has

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.440 
right now so it seems perhaps this has
been<00:03:49.500> happening<00:03:49.739> under<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.640> radar<00:03:51.150> as<00:03:51.299> it

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
well be bought out into where the radar

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.920 
well be bought out into where the radar
can<00:03:59.760> see<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.239> have<00:04:00.540> some<00:04:00.660> spotlights

here<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.180> certainly<00:04:09.390> this<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.230> first

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
here but certainly this is the first

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.410 
here but certainly this is the first
time<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.010> our<00:04:11.190> knowledge<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.880> such<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.299> issue
