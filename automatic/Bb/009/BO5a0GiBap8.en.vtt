to<00:00:42.989> where<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.379> arms<00:00:43.739> were<00:00:43.860> pretty<00:00:44.129> much

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to where my arms were pretty much

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
to where my arms were pretty much
straight<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.850> they're<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.090> turned<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> where

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
straight out they're not turned to where

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.510 
straight out they're not turned to where
if<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.170> were<00:00:46.260> holding<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.620> barbell<00:00:47.039> turn

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
if you were holding a barbell turn

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.049 
if you were holding a barbell turn
opposite<00:00:48.059> direction<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.670> vertical<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
opposite direction more of a vertical I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
opposite direction more of a vertical I
guess<00:00:51.420> would<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.899> way<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> put<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.680> four

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
guess would be a way to put it and four

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
guess would be a way to put it and four
sets<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> eight<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.870> target

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
sets of eight and these really target

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
sets of eight and these really target
the<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:55.739> part<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.280> chest<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.910> his

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the top part of your chest and his

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.810 
the top part of your chest and his
shoulder<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.129> really<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.309> these<00:00:59.579> really

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
shoulder I really like these really

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.290

barrel<00:01:12.150> style<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> guess<00:01:13.110> butterflies<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
barrel style our I guess butterflies is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.590 
barrel style our I guess butterflies is
what<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> technical<00:01:14.729> name<00:01:15.090> would<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
what the technical name would be I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
what the technical name would be I
pretty<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> say<00:01:16.860> barrel<00:01:17.250> style

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
pretty much I like to say barrel style

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.670 
pretty much I like to say barrel style
because<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> lot<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> times<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.170> feel<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.560> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
because a lot of times I feel like I'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.920 
because a lot of times I feel like I'm
hugging<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.130> barrel<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> come<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.119> because

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
hugging a barrel when I come up because

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.109 
hugging a barrel when I come up because
I'm<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.229> straightening<00:01:23.070> out<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.220> arms<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.880> just

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
I'm not straightening out my arms I just

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
I'm not straightening out my arms I just
pretty<00:01:24.509> much<00:01:24.570> feel<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.110> I'm<00:01:25.229> hugging<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pretty much feel like I'm hugging a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.520 
pretty much feel like I'm hugging a
barrel<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.630> four<00:01:27.630> sets<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> eight<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.380> these

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
barrel and four sets of eight of these

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
barrel and four sets of eight of these
as<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:29.009> which<00:01:29.460> pretty<00:01:29.970> much<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.270> guess

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
as well which pretty much I guess

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
as well which pretty much I guess
they're<00:01:30.659> considered<00:01:31.110> butterflies<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.310> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
they're considered butterflies but it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.890 
they're considered butterflies but it
keeps<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> tension<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.270> muscle<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
keeps the tension on the muscle and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.260 
keeps the tension on the muscle and
really<00:01:34.560> hits<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.400> stabilizing

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
really hits a lot of them stabilizing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850 
really hits a lot of them stabilizing
muscles<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> muscles<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
muscles and a lot of the muscles that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
muscles and a lot of the muscles that
you<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.040> activate<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:39.810> doing

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you don't activate when you're doing

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
you don't activate when you're doing
just<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.500> regular<00:01:40.890> barbell<00:01:41.369> bench<00:01:41.670> press

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
just a regular barbell bench press

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.920 
just a regular barbell bench press
whether<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.899> decline<00:01:43.530> or<00:01:43.710> incline<00:01:44.930> you

whether it be decline or incline you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
whether it be decline or incline you
leave<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.790> muscle<00:01:47.790> fibers<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.360> there

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
leave a lot of muscle fibers out there

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
has changed to where I'm isolating and

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.650 
has changed to where I'm isolating and
I'm<00:03:43.250> targeting<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.910> different<00:03:43.940> head<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.569> that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
I'm targeting a different head of that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.879 
I'm targeting a different head of that
muscle<00:03:44.930> or<00:03:45.109> hitting<00:03:45.290> it<00:03:45.440> from<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.709> different

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
muscle or hitting it from a different

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.099 
muscle or hitting it from a different
direction<00:03:46.190> just<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:47.180> when<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.569> curl<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:48.019> you

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
direction just like when you curl if you

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.840 
direction just like when you curl if you
change<00:03:48.410> your<00:03:48.560> wrist<00:03:48.769> movement<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.549> little

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
change your wrist movement just a little

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.000 
change your wrist movement just a little
bit<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.510> changes<00:03:51.079> the<00:03:51.200> way<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.350> target<00:03:51.859> that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
bit it changes the way you target that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.069 
bit it changes the way you target that
muscle<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:52.639> if<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.329> see<00:03:53.510> me<00:03:53.630> doing<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.870> lot<00:03:54.049> of
