00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.580
 Highlight was my video today 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.320
 really very much requested and indeed 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.669
 it's about my diet as me 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.020
 Just try to say something today 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.329
 what I eat 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.610
 why I eat that and show you too 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.009
 a few of my favorite dishes 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.820
 I do not want to be me 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.869
 Nutritionists are easy 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.770
 Things are very good for me 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.329
 function 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.669
 but of course I still hope that 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.590
 the video will be informative for you now 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.570
 will and you have fun watching 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.210
 so you will have only a few times 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.760
 general facts i am not a vegan 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.170
 or vegetarian I'm reluctant to eat 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.660
 meat just because I'm not so good 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.210
 tastes good and I try products 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.890
 to avoid because my asthma recommended 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.810
 just stop using less dairy 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.520
 take with me so that my skin becomes rainer 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.040
 That's why I like to drink 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.100
 almond milk or it can be like that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.170
 I also do not like yogurt 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.070
 Drinking soft drinks I got it all 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.809
 wean well 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.059
 and I can do it pretty well without it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 things that just have so much 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.439
 sugar and I can not find it somehow 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.820
 necessary somehow the whole cola too 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.090
 drink I really like to drink 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.490
 tea water or coffee cold drinks 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.950
 It's such a slight obsession of mine 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 so i really love cafÃ© latte 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 macchiato cappuccino mocha this whole 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.600
 that makes me happy and 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.819
 Of course, I also try 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.100
 not healthy to feed so much fruit 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.779
 and vegetables to eat many perfect 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.359
 to take products to me and also 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:37.579
 enough protein because, firstly , I feel 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.659
 Fitter and me better 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.969
 think my body it goes 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.709
 logically also better and natural 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.749
 also regular sports and you can 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.420
 Just train a lot better if you can 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:49.579
 eating healthy and not so 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.990
 heavy and full man somehow had 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.179
 I just give you a little something 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.189
 my favorite dishes are then 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.319
 Just go to the breakfast and that 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.799
 you already know pretty much me 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.840
 in fact, we really like to have breakfast and opel 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.630
 currently my favorite place is want 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.880
 this strawberry on the edge so that's on 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.160
 edge tastes as well as has oatmeal 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.290
 just a bit more protein and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.150
 I always do that away with a bit 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.520
 and then there is water in the water 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.920
 Microwave for two minutes fast 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.690
 make a few fruits to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.890
 big save over it and which one more 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.600
 little yogurt 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.850
 then you have a super delicious 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.740
 breakfast and that is very healthy 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.080
 and you can really be perfect in that 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.990
 start day means united to english 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.990
 School shows who for so long but I have to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.610
 about it and in the school leaves 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.400
 mostly so small things again 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.930
 once fruit or cereal bars or keep 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.970
 bread depending on how long in the school 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 am and how hungry I am and 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.260
 then I eat really well again 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.880
 when I come home stop 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.130
 I can always eat better 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.930
 because I am so relaxed and myself 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.820
 somehow disturbs the food and on 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.940
 My favorite food then this burghof to 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.489
 Of this a natura I am totally funny 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.050
 when I link to instagram on it 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.269
 because apparently I have been very often 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.610
 at least videos talked about it but me 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.860
 just like delicious and goes 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.970
 To make it totally fast and I do 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.540
 then stop sometimes a bit 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.130
 tomato sauce vegetables and salmon and scampis 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.980
 and then you have already 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.269
 the delicious lunch dinner i 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.820
 because actually most like one 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.920
 so much salad so really one 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.440
 Giant portion I really do 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.980
 all sorts of vegetables rank tomatoes 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.870
 Paprika cucumbers really all I care for 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.510
 I have fancy and sometimes a sheep's cheese 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.250
 or even oliven what you just so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.180
 So that's really true 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.170
 with pleasure 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.360
 besides, maybe I should still 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.130
 say this is a huge snack person 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.690
 So I'm really loving it 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.350
 in between and because so small things 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.269
 to do 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.950
 I also try every three to four 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.480
 Always eat something so I do not 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.280
 at once so a huge hot hunger 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.560
 developed and then I stop 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.329
 in between sometimes easy fruits 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.820
 or makes me so quark with fruits 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.799
 sometimes stony still carrots somehow 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.540
 and keep that in mind 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.489
 different or sometimes I have 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.579
 Of course I also like sweet and esther 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.840
 no idea about cookies but that 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.540
 always different but me 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.170
 Actually, always try healthy things 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.789
 really remember that and yes 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.260
 it was synonymous with the video now 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.329
 hope it was really reasonably 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.340
 informative and you have seen now 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.050
 which I just love to eat and how 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.390
 I feed myself so much 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.210
 Of course, there were times more times less 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.180
 but i'm actually going through a lot of trouble and 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.340

 really my favorite meal and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.919
