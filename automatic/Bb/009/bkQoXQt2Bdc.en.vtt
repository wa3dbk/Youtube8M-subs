 do not call it anymore they take me from now on the maid is called everything 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.230
 simply soubadou wrx sti 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.190

 than the box drive and softer and faster 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.700
 the platform also appeared a little less voracious in fuel than by the

 the cockpit hardly evolves hardly alas the brilliant and hard plastics 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.690
 always appear as misplaced aboard a car exceeding 40 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.870
 still remains a machine only effective and very powerful 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.760
 thrill seekers get ready to be disappointed despite

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.620
 the sound plan may seem disappointing 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.820

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 ease of handling is undoubtedly one of the strengths
