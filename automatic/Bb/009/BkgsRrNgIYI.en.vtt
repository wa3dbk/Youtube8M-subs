started<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.190> today's<00:00:38.280> mod<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.420> mod<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
started with today's mod so this mod is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
started with today's mod so this mod is
fairly<00:00:39.960> similar<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> lucky<00:00:40.920> blocks<00:00:41.190> mod

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
fairly similar to the lucky blocks mod

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
fairly similar to the lucky blocks mod
except<00:00:41.969> um<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.989> look<00:00:43.320> yeah<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> guess<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
except um it's a look yeah I guess a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260 
except um it's a look yeah I guess a
little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.160> different<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:45.120> mod

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
little bit different this mod

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.840 
little bit different this mod
particularly<00:00:45.960> does<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.950> allow<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
particularly does not allow you to get a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430 
particularly does not allow you to get a
lot<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> bad<00:00:48.450> things<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> happen<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
lot of bad things to happen to you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.810 
lot of bad things to happen to you
because<00:00:49.620> normally<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> lucky<00:00:50.370> blocks<00:00:50.610> mod

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

that<00:01:09.960> commonly<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.280> wouldn't<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.700> fair

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that commonly that just wouldn't be fair

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
that commonly that just wouldn't be fair
in<00:01:12.200> survival<00:01:13.200> mode<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.650> well<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:14.430> banned<00:01:14.760> items

just starting off minecraft this could

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
just starting off minecraft this could
be<00:01:59.369> very<00:01:59.399> useful<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.360> acquiring<00:02:00.869> tools<00:02:01.530> as

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
be very useful for acquiring tools as

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.889 
be very useful for acquiring tools as
well<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.490> various<00:02:02.850> different<00:02:03.299> other<00:02:03.420> items<00:02:03.810> in

Minecraft<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.979> yeah<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.310> wouldn't<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:05.759> we

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
Minecraft so yeah I wouldn't know we

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
Minecraft so yeah I wouldn't know we
could<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.119> teal<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> grass<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.049> use<00:02:07.259> some

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
could then teal the grass and use some

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.900 
could then teal the grass and use some
seeds<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.220> from<00:02:08.280> other<00:02:08.489> grass<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
seeds which we get from other grass to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.950 
seeds which we get from other grass to
create<00:02:09.119> food<00:02:09.330> right<00:02:09.569> after

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
create food right after

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.200 
create food right after

percentages and the rates of which the
four-leaf<00:02:19.770> clover<00:02:20.280> drops<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.170> common

items that are added in modded minecraft

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.200 
items that are added in modded minecraft
so<00:02:52.620> say<00:02:52.800> for<00:02:52.830> instance<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> dinosaur

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
so say for instance I have the dinosaur

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.810 
so say for instance I have the dinosaur
mod<00:02:55.110> which<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.590> can<00:02:55.620> see<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:55.980> have<00:02:56.430> it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
mod which as you can see I do have it

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.980 
mod which as you can see I do have it
does<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.480> chance<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.810> dropping

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
does have a chance of dropping

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.960 
does have a chance of dropping
Velociraptor<00:02:58.950> eggs<00:02:59.190> which<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.670> could<00:02:59.820> then<00:02:59.850> use

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
Velociraptor eggs which I could then use

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.110 
Velociraptor eggs which I could then use
to<00:03:00.390> create<00:03:00.690> or<00:03:00.960> spawned<00:03:01.590> velociraptors<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.090> I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to create or spawned velociraptors so I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
to create or spawned velociraptors so I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
maybe two stacks scrap that and go into

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.070 
maybe two stacks scrap that and go into
