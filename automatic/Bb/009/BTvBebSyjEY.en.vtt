gross inside so I want to show you how

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.230 
gross inside so I want to show you how
this<00:01:07.609> works<00:01:08.649> I'm<00:01:09.649> gonna<00:01:09.770> put<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.219> down<00:01:11.210> like

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
this works I'm gonna put it down like

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
this works I'm gonna put it down like
this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.180 

one<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.780> problems<00:01:17.230> you<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.590> with<00:01:17.890> an<00:01:18.040> RV

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
one of the problems you have with an RV

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.880 
one of the problems you have with an RV
shower<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.540> don't<00:01:19.780> get<00:01:20.050> very<00:01:20.380> good<00:01:20.500> water

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
shower is you don't get very good water

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.540 
shower is you don't get very good water
pressure<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.540> as<00:01:23.110> you<00:01:24.100> can<00:01:24.250> see<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:27.190> gives

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
pressure and as you can see this gives

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.810 
pressure and as you can see this gives
really<00:01:27.760> good<00:01:27.880> water<00:01:28.240> pressure<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.670> of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
really good water pressure and one of

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.600 
really good water pressure and one of
the<00:01:30.910> cool<00:01:31.150> features<00:01:31.180> about<00:01:31.690> this<00:01:32.320> product<00:01:33.250> is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
the cool features about this product is

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.990 
the cool features about this product is
you<00:01:33.640> can<00:01:33.970> press<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.810> button<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:36.960> pause<00:01:37.960> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you can press this button and pause it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.050 
you can press this button and pause it
because<00:01:40.000> RV<00:01:40.720> showers<00:01:41.200> only<00:01:41.530> have<00:01:41.920> about<00:01:42.310> seven

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
because RV showers only have about seven

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.930 
because RV showers only have about seven
gallons<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:44.650> only<00:01:44.860> have<00:01:45.040> seven<00:01:45.430> gallons<00:01:45.820> in

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
gallons we only have seven gallons in

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.639 
gallons we only have seven gallons in
ours<00:01:46.119> of<00:01:47.050> water<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.140> press<00:01:50.380> this<00:01:50.590> button

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
ours of water so you press this button

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.730 
ours of water so you press this button
and<00:01:52.560> it'll<00:01:53.560> pause<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.160> now<00:01:55.080> look<00:01:56.080> at<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.200> flow

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
and it'll pause it now look at that flow

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.250 
and it'll pause it now look at that flow
out<00:01:57.130> of<00:01:57.369> it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.400 

it's<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.950> pretty<00:02:01.130> good<00:02:01.340> flow<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.320> you

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's a pretty good flow and I think you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.190 
it's a pretty good flow and I think you
can<00:02:03.590> even<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:04.010> doesn't<00:02:04.310> even<00:02:04.370> better<00:02:05.140> if<00:02:06.140> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
can even it doesn't even better if you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.900 
can even it doesn't even better if you
have<00:02:06.760> if<00:02:07.760> you<00:02:07.910> have<00:02:08.060> better<00:02:08.330> water<00:02:08.660> pressure

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
have if you have better water pressure

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
have if you have better water pressure
with<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.180> RV<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.670> general<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.800> we<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.980> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
with your RV in general but we have a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.770 
with your RV in general but we have a
bit<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.340> an<00:02:16.520> older<00:02:16.850> RV<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:19.330> may<00:02:20.330> not<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.540> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
bit of an older RV and may not have the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
bit of an older RV and may not have the
best<00:02:21.080> water<00:02:21.440> pressure<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:22.160> general<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.800> this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
best water pressure in general but this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.590 
best water pressure in general but this
is<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.250> much<00:02:25.280> better<00:02:25.610> than<00:02:26.000> what<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:26.450> had

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
is so much better than what we had

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.160 
is so much better than what we had
before<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:29.000> about<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.630> hundred<00:02:29.870> percent

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
before it's about a hundred percent

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.250 
before it's about a hundred percent
times<00:02:30.680> better<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.460> just<00:02:31.640> wanted<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.260> give

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
times better so I just wanted to give

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.520 
times better so I just wanted to give
you<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.440> look<00:02:33.590> at<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.010> it's<00:02:34.250> only<00:02:34.430> got<00:02:34.670> one

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
you a look at it it's only got one

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.950 
you a look at it it's only got one
setting<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.850> guess<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.240> shoots<00:02:38.510> out<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.750> lot

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
setting and I guess it shoots out a lot

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.610 
setting and I guess it shoots out a lot
of<00:02:39.080> air<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.070> that's<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:40.370> makes<00:02:40.610> it

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
of air with it and that's what makes it

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.830 
of air with it and that's what makes it
come<00:02:42.620> out<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.240> quickly<00:02:44.240> with<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.660> much

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
come out so quickly with the much

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.860 
come out so quickly with the much
pressure<00:02:45.170> as<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.470> does<00:02:45.710> and<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:47.360> know<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.660> fit

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
pressure as it does and you know it fit

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.140 
pressure as it does and you know it fit
this<00:02:48.110> isn't<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.680> what<00:02:49.280> came<00:02:49.520> with<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.940> but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
this isn't the what came with it but

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.480 
this isn't the what came with it but
fits<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.290> there<00:02:51.500> really<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.040> take<00:02:52.340> it
