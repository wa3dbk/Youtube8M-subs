problem<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.239> as<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.780> those<00:02:34.900> FEMA<00:02:35.140> camps<00:02:35.380> I'm

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
problem and as for those FEMA camps I'm

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.800 
problem and as for those FEMA camps I'm
fairly<00:02:35.860> sure<00:02:36.010> those<00:02:36.250> aren't<00:02:36.459> set<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.880> just

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.170 
fairly sure those aren't set up just
like<00:02:37.959> New<00:02:38.170> Orleans<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.580> know<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.730> would<00:02:40.000> see

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
this weather is perfect for making was

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.280 
this weather is perfect for making was
outside<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:42.850> society<00:02:43.390> says<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> can't<00:02:44.080> do

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
outside but society says that I can't do

outside but society says that I can't do
that<00:02:44.320> well<00:02:45.100> society<00:02:45.670> probably<00:02:46.030> has<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.239> right

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
that well society probably has the right

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780 
that well society probably has the right
idea<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.370> believe<00:02:48.640> this

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
idea on that one when you believe this

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.330 
idea on that one when you believe this
kind<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.209> weather<00:02:49.360> might<00:02:49.660> happen<00:02:50.019> again<00:02:50.340> next

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
