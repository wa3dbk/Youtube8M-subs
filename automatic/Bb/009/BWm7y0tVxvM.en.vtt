00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.570
 hello knit scarf snood for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.539
 this type from the selected yarn 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.400
 chain of air loops 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.590
 so that it was the number of loops must 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.290
 be a multiple of 6 I have already recruited here 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.340
 234 loops after which we need 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.750
 to connect 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.079
 close the circle when you do it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.860
 look carefully so as not to twist 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.860
 knitting 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.500
 so we connect 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.679
 now do 3 air loops next 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:28.530
 loop we will knit a column with one 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:30.369
 nakida knit two loops together 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.630
 we seize a working thread 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:39.939
 kind of ecli together and again next 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.929
 eyelet at the base do nakida introduce 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:48.849
 hook grab two provyazyvaem 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:56.849
 together 2 together now do 3 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:56.849
 air loops 1 2 3 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.830
 on the chain of the base count 3 loops 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.950
 1 2 3 and 4 we make a column with one 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.950
 nakidom 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.830
 again 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:27.830
 nakid following 2 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.830
 knit 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.570
 again 3 air loops skip three 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.830
 loops here and in the fourth do 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.830
 single crochet 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.670
 again we do the following two 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.670
 single crochet 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:12.340
 and so we continue to knit until the end to 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.330
 the junction that is, it will 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.810
 turn out 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.620
 3 single crochet posts 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.310
 after which 3 air loops and again three 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.849
 single crochet 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:33.180
 we connect the first row and I connect it 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:38.670
 I will be in the second column with one cap 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:46.650
 I immediately catch the left side of the eyelet 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.650
 pulling together three air loops 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.040
 coat and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.489
 we have two columns and 3 we 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.090
 we will pass 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.090
 through this hole 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:22.630
 so again the next 3 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:25.680
 air loops and now we dress 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.680
 its average 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 then did not put 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.940
 and the third will be used here in this 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.940
 big hole 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.280
 what happens we shift left to 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.100
 one loop of our drawing 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.510
 principle you can do whatever you like 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.910
 There is this this scheme can very 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.320
 modify you can do here 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.910
 not 3 columns 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.670
 2 or 4 5 not 3 air loops again 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.040
 same five six seven and so on the same 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.070
 thing if he does not like can 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.830
 return one over the other or vice versa 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.750
 do staggered i'm showing 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.970
 option form we have one loop of y 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:28.160
 we will move to the left than good 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.660
 this scarf 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.860
 A great option for beginners because 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.870
 that when you wear such a chance to any 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:44.120
 their mistakes will not be seen just plain 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.120
 also very light 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.670
 but also in time a very fast project 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.280
 finish second row 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:07.800
 and also connect to the first column a 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.800
 with the second just connect 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:26.180
 We make 3 loops 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:30.199
 next loop for both walls do 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:34.610
 double crochet that is 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.710
 it turns out we have the first column 2 and 3 we 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.840
 we will use this big 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.449
 the hole that is everything is exactly the same as 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.610
 in previous rows 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:49.270
 what we do we get offsets 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.270
 one loop to the left and so continue 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.340
 I knitted 15 rows then connected 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.150
 here is the row remaining tip 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.240
 cut off and hid in knitting also we 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:17.300
 in the same way hid the tip in 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.990
 beginning using the hook and that's it on 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.990
 scarf ready
