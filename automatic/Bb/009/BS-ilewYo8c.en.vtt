00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
trying to get by but it's a little

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.670 
trying to get by but it's a little
things<00:05:07.270> like<00:05:07.450> reading<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.020> pattern<00:05:08.229> of<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
things like reading the pattern of the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.830 
things like reading the pattern of the
tackles<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.729> is<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.150> a<00:05:10.210> horizontal<00:05:10.690> vertical

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
tackles and is it a horizontal vertical

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.050 
tackles and is it a horizontal vertical
set<00:05:11.260> you<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:11.919> what's<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.610> rules<00:05:12.850> in<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
set you know what's the rules in the

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
set you know what's the rules in the
horizontal<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.570> means<00:05:13.720> there's<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:13.930> whole

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
horizontal it means there's a whole

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.140 
horizontal it means there's a whole
different<00:05:14.530> breakdown<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:15.400> it's<00:05:15.850> got<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.120> be

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
different breakdown and it's got to be

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.909 
different breakdown and it's got to be
thought<00:05:16.419> about<00:05:16.450> in<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.140> split-second<00:05:17.770> so

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
thought about in that split-second so

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.230 
thought about in that split-second so
