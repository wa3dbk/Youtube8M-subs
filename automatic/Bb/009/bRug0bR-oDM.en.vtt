hello<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.200> mr.<00:00:04.710> Buffington<00:00:05.220> we're

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
hello this is mr. Buffington we're

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.030 
hello this is mr. Buffington we're
looking<00:00:05.910> at<00:00:06.029> inequalities<00:00:06.899> today<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.470> little

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
looking at inequalities today a little

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.040 
looking at inequalities today a little
bit<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.490> basics<00:00:08.969> of<00:00:09.179> what<00:00:09.450> an<00:00:09.599> inequality

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
bit of the basics of what an inequality

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.100 
bit of the basics of what an inequality
is<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.890> how<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.880> take<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> look<00:00:12.809> at<00:00:12.990> them

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
is and how we can take a look at them

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.310 
is and how we can take a look at them
alright<00:00:14.010> first<00:00:14.670> off<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.180> symbols<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:16.199> an

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
alright first off the symbols for an

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.040 
alright first off the symbols for an
inequality<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.789> symbol<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.600> see<00:00:18.840> right

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
inequality this symbol you see right

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.640 
inequality this symbol you see right
here<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:20.090> known<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.449> less<00:00:22.020> than<00:00:22.320> symbol

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
here is known as the less than symbol

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
here is known as the less than symbol
all<00:00:23.640> right

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
all right

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.990 
all right
sometimes<00:00:24.570> people<00:00:24.990> remember<00:00:25.440> it<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.680> like

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
sometimes people remember it as like

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.090 
sometimes people remember it as like
pac-man<00:00:27.000> mouth<00:00:27.600> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.109> opening<00:00:28.650> towards

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
pac-man mouth kind of opening towards

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.849 
pac-man mouth kind of opening towards
something<00:00:29.400> that's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.910> larger<00:00:30.710> here's<00:00:31.710> an

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
something that's a larger here's an

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.560 
something that's a larger here's an
example<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.609> would<00:00:32.910> use<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.449> would

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
example of how we would use it we would

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.240 
example of how we would use it we would
say<00:00:33.750> 1<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.410> less<00:00:35.280> than<00:00:35.309> 2<00:00:36.770> right<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> one's<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
say 1 is less than 2 right that one's a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
say 1 is less than 2 right that one's a
pretty<00:00:38.520> straightforward<00:00:38.820> example<00:00:39.270> any

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pretty straightforward example any

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
pretty straightforward example any
negative<00:00:41.010> number<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.820> less<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
negative number would be less than a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.959 
negative number would be less than a
positive<00:00:42.960> number<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.620> negative<00:00:44.250> 3<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.640> less

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
positive number so negative 3 is less

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.220 
positive number so negative 3 is less
than<00:00:45.030> 2<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.590> negative<00:00:46.969> 10<00:00:48.050> really<00:00:49.050> big

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
than 2 and then negative 10 really big

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
than 2 and then negative 10 really big
negative<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:50.129> far<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> negative<00:00:51.059> side

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
negative really far to the negative side

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.709 
negative really far to the negative side
there<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.870> big<00:00:52.770> negative<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:54.210> definitely

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
there that's big negative is definitely

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
there that's big negative is definitely
less<00:00:54.899> than<00:00:54.980> smaller<00:00:55.980> negative<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.700> negative

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
less than smaller negative so negative

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.040 
less than smaller negative so negative
10<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> less<00:00:58.620> than<00:00:58.920> negative<00:00:59.100> 5<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:00.870> are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
10 is less than negative 5 and those are

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.470 
10 is less than negative 5 and those are
some<00:01:01.230> example<00:01:01.710> again<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.360> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
some example again you can think of it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.160 
some example again you can think of it
as<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.870> smaller<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.579> versus<00:01:06.569> the<00:01:06.719> larger

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
as a smaller side here versus the larger

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
as a smaller side here versus the larger
side<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.219> actual<00:01:08.609> symbol<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.389> people

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
side of the actual symbol some people

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.359 
side of the actual symbol some people
again<00:01:09.899> they<00:01:09.959> draw<00:01:10.259> like<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.469> Pac<00:01:10.770> Man<00:01:10.799> type

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
again they draw like a Pac Man type

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.819 
again they draw like a Pac Man type
thing<00:01:11.609> you<00:01:11.639> want<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:11.999> the<00:01:12.450> pac-man<00:01:13.229> wants<00:01:13.709> to

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
thing you want to the pac-man wants to

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.669 
thing you want to the pac-man wants to
eat<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.249> bigger<00:01:14.490> number<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.389> a<00:01:15.600> fish<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.529> there

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
eat the bigger number of a fish on there

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:17.870 
eat the bigger number of a fish on there
or<00:01:16.799> something<00:01:16.829> like<00:01:17.279> that<00:01:17.459> and<00:01:17.609> that's<00:01:17.759> fine

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
or something like that and that's fine

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.239 
or something like that and that's fine
to<00:01:18.240> remember<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.749> that<00:01:18.779> way<00:01:19.079> just<00:01:19.289> remember

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
to remember it that way just remember

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.919 
to remember it that way just remember
that<00:01:20.399> this<00:01:20.579> symbol<00:01:20.999> is<00:01:21.119> representing<00:01:21.779> that

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
that this symbol is representing that

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.609 
that this symbol is representing that
the<00:01:22.079> smaller<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.709> is<00:01:22.859> on<00:01:23.039> the<00:01:23.819> left<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.749> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the smaller thing is on the left and the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.339 
the smaller thing is on the left and the
1<00:01:25.859> in<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.279> case<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.819> less<00:01:27.149> than<00:01:27.179> 2<00:01:27.749> that's<00:01:28.139> how

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:28.349 
1 in this case is less than 2 that's how

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:31.190 
1 in this case is less than 2 that's how
we<00:01:28.409> would<00:01:28.679> read<00:01:28.859> this<00:01:29.090> all<00:01:30.090> right<00:01:30.240> let's<00:01:31.020> look

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we would read this all right let's look

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
we would read this all right let's look
at<00:01:31.349> a<00:01:31.409> circle<00:01:31.859> it's<00:01:32.099> very<00:01:32.459> similar<00:01:32.819> this<00:01:33.749> 1

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
at a circle it's very similar this 1

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.339 
at a circle it's very similar this 1
here<00:01:34.259> means<00:01:34.439> less<00:01:34.829> than<00:01:34.859> or<00:01:35.429> equal<00:01:36.209> to<00:01:36.479> all

here means less than or equal to all

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.620 
here means less than or equal to all
right<00:01:37.499> that's<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.889> symbol<00:01:38.159> number<00:01:38.549> 2<00:01:38.789> some

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
right that's our symbol number 2 some

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
right that's our symbol number 2 some
examples<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.349> less<00:01:40.619> than<00:01:40.649> or<00:01:41.039> equal<00:01:41.399> to

equal to 3

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.309 
equal to 3
you'll<00:01:53.609> notice<00:01:53.849> that<00:01:54.029> again<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.899> cases

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
you'll notice that again in all cases

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.010 
you'll notice that again in all cases
the<00:01:55.889> number<00:01:56.249> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.459> left<00:01:56.669> is<00:01:56.909> smaller<00:01:57.389> or

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the number on the left is smaller or

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
the number on the left is smaller or
less<00:01:58.289> than<00:01:58.529> the<00:01:58.709> number<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.270> except

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
less than the number on the right except

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.419 
less than the number on the right except
when<00:02:00.929> they're<00:02:01.139> equal<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.309> only

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
when they're equal so the only

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.909 
when they're equal so the only
difference<00:02:02.700> between<00:02:03.059> our<00:02:03.719> less<00:02:04.169> than<00:02:04.439> symbol

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:04.919 
difference between our less than symbol

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:07.399 
difference between our less than symbol
and<00:02:05.099> our<00:02:05.369> less<00:02:05.549> than<00:02:05.759> or<00:02:05.909> equal<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.479> symbol<00:02:06.749> is

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and our less than or equal to symbol is

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
and our less than or equal to symbol is
that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.709> numbers<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> left<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that the numbers on the left and the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
that the numbers on the left and the
right<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.569> equal<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.229> each<00:02:10.379> other

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
right can be equal to each other

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.179 
right can be equal to each other
so<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.459> case<00:02:11.700> 3<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.480> equal<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.110> 3<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.680> it's

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
so in this case 3 is equal to 3 so it's

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.360 
so in this case 3 is equal to 3 so it's
also<00:02:14.370> less<00:02:14.819> than<00:02:14.849> or

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
also less than or

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.500 
also less than or
equal<00:02:15.549> to<00:02:15.730> three<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.750> right<00:02:18.150> let's<00:02:19.150> look<00:02:19.330> at

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
equal to three all right let's look at

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.080

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
the other symbol the greater than symbol

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.710 
the other symbol the greater than symbol

five so again the only difference here

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.420 
five so again the only difference here
is<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:15.069> we<00:03:15.579> can<00:03:15.849> include<00:03:16.540> equal<00:03:17.409> numbers<00:03:18.129> to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
is that we can include equal numbers to

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.809 
is that we can include equal numbers to
each<00:03:18.459> other<00:03:19.019> now<00:03:20.019> when<00:03:20.829> we're<00:03:21.040> asked<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> solve

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
to 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we can make it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.990 
to 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we can make it
anything<00:03:47.290> that's<00:03:47.650> greater<00:03:48.250> than<00:03:48.520> 2<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.910> it

makes<00:03:49.210> that<00:03:49.390> statement<00:03:49.960> true<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:51.280> we<00:03:51.460> can't

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
makes that statement true so we can't

really say all the possible numbers that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.300 
really say all the possible numbers that
are<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> solution<00:03:55.510> but<00:03:56.230> what<00:03:56.380> we<00:03:56.530> can<00:03:56.800> do<00:03:57.100> is

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
are a solution but what we can do is

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.630 
are a solution but what we can do is
graph<00:03:58.210> inequalities<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.890> that<00:04:00.040> we<00:04:00.130> can<00:04:00.340> show

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
graph inequalities so that we can show

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.620 
graph inequalities so that we can show
the<00:04:00.670> show<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.720> solution<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.710> visual<00:04:03.100> way<00:04:03.630> so

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
the show the solution in a visual way so

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.930 
the show the solution in a visual way so
here<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.960> how<00:04:05.110> we<00:04:05.140> could<00:04:05.410> do<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:06.400> X<00:04:06.670> is

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
here is how we could do that for X is

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.870 
here is how we could do that for X is
greater<00:04:07.180> than<00:04:07.480> positive<00:04:07.900> 2<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:09.280> we'll<00:04:09.460> do<00:04:09.670> is

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
greater than positive 2 what we'll do is

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.790 
greater than positive 2 what we'll do is
we<00:04:10.090> will<00:04:10.120> start<00:04:10.570> by<00:04:10.750> making<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.230> circle<00:04:11.650> at<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
we will start by making a circle at the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.930 
we will start by making a circle at the
point<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:12.400> 2<00:04:13.020> right<00:04:14.020> because<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:15.010> not<00:04:15.100> equal

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
point of 2 right because it's not equal

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.430 
point of 2 right because it's not equal
to<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.300> point<00:04:16.600> we're<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.989> keep<00:04:17.200> that

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
to that point we're going to keep that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.280 
to that point we're going to keep that
circle<00:04:17.920> open<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.610> then<00:04:19.480> we're<00:04:19.690> going<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.989> draw

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
circle open and then we're going to draw

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.740 
circle open and then we're going to draw
an<00:04:20.560> arrow<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.250> represent<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.060> anything

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
an arrow to represent that anything

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.670 
an arrow to represent that anything
greater<00:04:23.260> than<00:04:23.590> 2<00:04:23.920> is<00:04:24.220> part<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.060> solution

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
greater than 2 is part of this solution

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.160 
greater than 2 is part of this solution
every<00:04:26.680> single<00:04:27.100> number<00:04:27.390> greater<00:04:28.390> than<00:04:28.660> 2<00:04:28.870> is

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
every single number greater than 2 is

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.680 
every single number greater than 2 is
part<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.920> that<00:04:29.980> solution<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:31.300> that's<00:04:31.450> how<00:04:31.630> we

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
part of that solution so that's how we

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.760 
part of that solution so that's how we
would<00:04:31.900> graph<00:04:32.290> that<00:04:32.910> inequality<00:04:34.470> let's<00:04:35.470> look

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
would graph that inequality let's look

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.820 
would graph that inequality let's look
at<00:04:35.890> a<00:04:35.920> different<00:04:36.130> one<00:04:36.460> X<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:37.300> less<00:04:37.720> than

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
at a different one X is less than

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.700 
at a different one X is less than
negative<00:04:38.830> 2<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.510> we're<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:40.960> do<00:04:41.140> exactly

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
negative 2 so we're going to do exactly

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.170 
negative 2 so we're going to do exactly
the<00:04:41.920> same<00:04:42.130> thing<00:04:42.370> we'll<00:04:42.580> start<00:04:42.850> out<00:04:43.000> by

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
the same thing we'll start out by

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.330 
the same thing we'll start out by
putting<00:04:43.420> an<00:04:43.660> open<00:04:44.050> circle<00:04:44.530> at<00:04:44.650> negative<00:04:44.680> 2

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
putting an open circle at negative 2

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.240 
putting an open circle at negative 2
circles<00:04:46.180> open<00:04:46.750> because<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.350> doesn't<00:04:47.800> include

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
circles open because it doesn't include

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.880 
circles open because it doesn't include
that<00:04:48.400> value<00:04:49.090> negative<00:04:49.720> 2<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.260> not<00:04:50.500> part<00:04:50.830> of

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
that value negative 2 is not part of

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.880 
that value negative 2 is not part of
this<00:04:51.070> solution<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:52.300> we<00:04:52.510> can't<00:04:52.750> fill<00:04:53.560> in<00:04:53.710> that

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
this solution so we can't fill in that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.400 
this solution so we can't fill in that
circle<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.520> we'll<00:04:55.120> put<00:04:55.300> an<00:04:55.390> open<00:04:55.570> circle<00:04:55.810> and

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
circle so we'll put an open circle and

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.890 
circle so we'll put an open circle and
then<00:04:56.890> we'll<00:04:57.070> have<00:04:57.220> an<00:04:57.370> arrow<00:04:57.670> pointing<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.600> the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
then we'll have an arrow pointing to the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.820 
then we'll have an arrow pointing to the
left<00:04:59.640> all<00:05:00.640> right<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:01.180> anything<00:05:01.990> less<00:05:02.470> than

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
left all right so anything less than

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.400 
left all right so anything less than
that<00:05:02.890> is<00:05:03.340> true<00:05:03.820> negative<00:05:04.510> 5<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:05.020> less<00:05:05.080> than

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
that is true negative 5 is less than

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.250 
that is true negative 5 is less than
negative<00:05:05.740> 2<00:05:06.130> negative<00:05:06.310> 6<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:07.420> also<00:05:07.660> less<00:05:08.050> than

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
negative 2 negative 6 is also less than

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.680 
negative 2 negative 6 is also less than
negative<00:05:08.410> 2<00:05:08.800> negative<00:05:09.040> 10<00:05:09.910> negative<00:05:09.940> 20

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
negative 2 negative 10 negative 20

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.780 
negative 2 negative 10 negative 20
negative<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:11.140> thousand<00:05:11.770> is<00:05:11.950> less<00:05:12.520> than

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
negative a thousand is less than

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.960 
negative a thousand is less than
negative<00:05:12.970> 2<00:05:13.480> all<00:05:14.110> right<00:05:14.290> any<00:05:14.560> number<00:05:15.190> on<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
negative 2 all right any number on the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.170 
negative 2 all right any number on the
left<00:05:16.210> side<00:05:16.540> of<00:05:17.290> this<00:05:17.560> open<00:05:17.950> circle<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:18.730> going

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
left side of this open circle is going

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.540 
left side of this open circle is going
to<00:05:19.300> be<00:05:19.420> less<00:05:19.690> than<00:05:19.720> negative<00:05:20.080> 2<00:05:20.560> so<00:05:21.400> that

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
to be less than negative 2 so that

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.970 
to be less than negative 2 so that
therefore<00:05:21.850> all<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.360> those<00:05:22.810> numbers<00:05:23.290> are<00:05:23.470> part

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
therefore all of those numbers are part

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.070 
therefore all of those numbers are part
of<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.190> solution<00:05:24.700> we<00:05:24.880> could<00:05:25.390> push<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.870> arrow

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
of the solution we could push the arrow

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.870 
of the solution we could push the arrow
all<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.350> way<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.800> end<00:05:26.950> or<00:05:27.190> just<00:05:27.250> leave<00:05:27.850> it

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
all the way to the end or just leave it

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.150 
all the way to the end or just leave it
as<00:05:28.150> an<00:05:28.300> open<00:05:28.450> arrow<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.410> that<00:05:29.530> represents

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
as an open arrow so that represents

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.380 
as an open arrow so that represents
everything<00:05:30.610> on<00:05:30.970> that<00:05:31.000> side<00:05:31.590> all<00:05:32.590> right

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
everything on that side all right

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.830 
everything on that side all right
when<00:05:34.390> we<00:05:34.600> have<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.850> less<00:05:36.850> than<00:05:36.880> or<00:05:37.270> equal<00:05:37.660> to

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
when we have a less than or equal to

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.920 
when we have a less than or equal to
greater<00:05:38.230> than<00:05:38.380> or<00:05:38.650> equal<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.220> sign<00:05:39.600> we<00:05:40.600> change

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
greater than or equal to sign we change

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.930 
greater than or equal to sign we change
one<00:05:41.320> thing<00:05:41.710> while<00:05:42.010> we're<00:05:42.190> making<00:05:42.340> this<00:05:42.700> and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
one thing while we're making this and

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.600 
one thing while we're making this and
that<00:05:43.540> is<00:05:43.780> that<00:05:44.260> instead<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.770> using<00:05:44.950> an<00:05:45.220> open

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
that is that instead of using an open

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.210 
that is that instead of using an open
circle<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:46.780> fill<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.290> in<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.650> filled<00:05:47.980> it<00:05:48.100> in

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
circle we fill it in so I filled it in

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.970 
circle we fill it in so I filled it in
with<00:05:48.250> blue

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
with blue

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.430 
with blue
there<00:05:49.310> so<00:05:49.760> X<00:05:50.060> is<00:05:50.300> greater<00:05:50.540> than<00:05:50.780> or<00:05:50.930> equal<00:05:51.320> to

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
there so X is greater than or equal to

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.560 
there so X is greater than or equal to
negative<00:05:51.620> 4<00:05:51.920> I'm<00:05:52.490> going<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.910> have<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.060> circle

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
negative 4 I'm going to have a circle

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.870 
negative 4 I'm going to have a circle
that's<00:05:53.690> filled<00:05:54.140> in<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.620> then<00:05:55.460> I'm<00:05:55.640> going<00:05:55.790> to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
that's filled in and then I'm going to

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.300 
that's filled in and then I'm going to
draw<00:05:56.090> my<00:05:56.120> arrow<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:57.260> X<00:05:57.530> is<00:05:57.770> greater<00:05:58.010> than

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
draw my arrow so X is greater than

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.630 
draw my arrow so X is greater than
negative<00:05:58.520> 4<00:05:59.330> or<00:05:59.540> equal<00:06:00.170> to<00:06:00.350> negative<00:06:00.530> 4<00:06:00.800> so<00:06:01.610> I

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
negative 4 or equal to negative 4 so I

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.670 
negative 4 or equal to negative 4 so I
fill<00:06:01.970> in<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.240> circle<00:06:02.450> for<00:06:02.810> negative<00:06:03.200> 4<00:06:03.440> and

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
fill in the circle for negative 4 and

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.500 
fill in the circle for negative 4 and
then<00:06:04.220> I<00:06:04.370> draw<00:06:04.700> my<00:06:04.880> arrow<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.270> represent

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
then I draw my arrow to represent

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.510 
then I draw my arrow to represent
everything<00:06:06.350> greater<00:06:07.070> than<00:06:07.460> negative<00:06:08.000> 4<00:06:09.520> the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
everything greater than negative 4 the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.150 
everything greater than negative 4 the
one<00:06:10.700> with<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:11.120> less<00:06:11.780> than<00:06:12.080> or<00:06:12.260> yeah<00:06:12.740> less<00:06:12.950> than

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
one with the less than or yeah less than

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.210 
one with the less than or yeah less than
or<00:06:13.280> equal<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.730> X<00:06:14.420> is<00:06:14.660> less<00:06:14.750> than<00:06:15.110> or<00:06:15.170> equal<00:06:15.560> to<00:06:15.710> 3

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
or equal to X is less than or equal to 3

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.370 
or equal to X is less than or equal to 3
I'm<00:06:16.760> going<00:06:16.880> to<00:06:17.000> draw<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.270> filled<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:17.750> circle<00:06:17.810> at

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
I'm going to draw a filled in circle at

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.410 
I'm going to draw a filled in circle at
the<00:06:18.410> point<00:06:18.530> positive<00:06:19.280> 3<00:06:19.580> and<00:06:20.060> I'm<00:06:20.120> going<00:06:20.360> to

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
the point positive 3 and I'm going to

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.150 
the point positive 3 and I'm going to
draw<00:06:20.600> my<00:06:20.630> arrow<00:06:21.020> to<00:06:21.170> represent<00:06:21.770> everything

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
draw my arrow to represent everything

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.600 
draw my arrow to represent everything
less<00:06:22.910> than<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.960> number<00:06:24.260> all<00:06:25.100> right<00:06:25.190> so<00:06:25.490> the

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
less than that number all right so the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.030 
less than that number all right so the
difference<00:06:26.120> is<00:06:26.360> that<00:06:26.570> with<00:06:27.140> the<00:06:27.320> less<00:06:27.530> than<00:06:27.830> or

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
difference is that with the less than or

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.670 
difference is that with the less than or
equal<00:06:28.730> to<00:06:29.150> and<00:06:29.450> greater<00:06:29.480> than<00:06:29.990> and<00:06:30.320> equal<00:06:30.410> to

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
equal to and greater than and equal to

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.830 
equal to and greater than and equal to
make<00:06:31.520> sure<00:06:31.700> to<00:06:31.850> fill<00:06:32.060> in<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.390> circle

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
make sure to fill in that circle

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.800 
make sure to fill in that circle
otherwise<00:06:33.320> same<00:06:33.920> basic<00:06:34.340> things<00:06:34.580> so<00:06:35.360> just<00:06:35.660> a

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
otherwise same basic things so just a

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.790 
otherwise same basic things so just a
quick<00:06:36.110> look<00:06:36.350> at<00:06:36.590> a<00:06:37.580> comparison<00:06:38.540> here<00:06:38.960> this<00:06:39.560> is

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
quick look at a comparison here this is

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.340 
quick look at a comparison here this is
X<00:06:40.010> is<00:06:40.280> greater<00:06:40.310> than<00:06:40.700> one<00:06:41.120> we<00:06:41.570> have<00:06:41.870> an<00:06:41.990> open

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
X is greater than one we have an open

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.830 
X is greater than one we have an open
circle<00:06:42.860> this<00:06:43.310> is<00:06:43.520> X<00:06:43.850> as<00:06:44.150> a<00:06:44.180> less<00:06:44.420> than<00:06:44.630> or<00:06:44.750> equal

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
circle this is X as a less than or equal

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.260 
circle this is X as a less than or equal
to<00:06:45.080> negative<00:06:45.350> 5<00:06:45.770> our<00:06:46.460> circle<00:06:46.940> is<00:06:46.970> going<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.210> be

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
to negative 5 our circle is going to be

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.600 
to negative 5 our circle is going to be
filled<00:06:47.600> in<00:06:47.840> some<00:06:48.440> basic<00:06:48.650> differences<00:06:49.370> between

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
filled in some basic differences between

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.600 
filled in some basic differences between
those<00:06:50.000> two<00:06:50.270> so<00:06:51.110> that<00:06:51.320> is<00:06:51.650> the<00:06:51.860> basics<00:06:52.460> of

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
those two so that is the basics of

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.880 
those two so that is the basics of
inequalities<00:06:53.510> what<00:06:53.750> they<00:06:53.930> are<00:06:54.140> how<00:06:54.440> we<00:06:54.500> graph

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
inequalities what they are how we graph

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.930 
inequalities what they are how we graph
and<00:06:55.130> how<00:06:55.280> we<00:06:55.340> show<00:06:55.670> them<00:06:55.910> and<00:06:56.120> that<00:06:56.900> is<00:06:57.200> all<00:06:57.980> for

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
and how we show them and that is all for

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.300 
and how we show them and that is all for
this<00:06:59.030> lesson
