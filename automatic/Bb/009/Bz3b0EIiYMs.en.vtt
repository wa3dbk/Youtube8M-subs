crafting table has been inspired by
terraria<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.199> obviously<00:00:28.439> those<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
terraria so obviously those of you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
terraria so obviously those of you
probably<00:00:29.010> play<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.760> terraria<00:00:30.240> would<00:00:30.359> know

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
probably play the terraria would know

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.920 
probably play the terraria would know
how<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.810> craft<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
how you craft things in this this is the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
how you craft things in this this is the
crafting<00:00:34.260> table<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> number<00:00:35.430> two<00:00:35.579> as

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
crafting table this is the number two as

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
crafting table this is the number two as
you<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.329> fairly<00:00:36.570> sore<00:00:36.870> similar

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

looks<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.579> cool<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.090> we'll<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
looks pretty cool but we'll get to that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.119 
looks pretty cool but we'll get to that
and<00:00:40.079> second<00:00:40.290> I'll<00:00:40.350> quickly<00:00:40.530> show<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.070> you

there's normal workbench and then you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
there's normal workbench and then you
need<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> plunk<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.610> also<00:00:51.480> then

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you place the three paper in a vertical

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.080 
you place the three paper in a vertical
line<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.450> create<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.750> book<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> now

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
line and then you create a book so now

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.740 
line and then you create a book so now
which<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.140> break<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> crafting<00:01:11.010> table

any<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.930> break<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.450> simply

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
any other break and now you can simply

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
any other break and now you can simply
combine<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.930> now

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
combine the two and as you see now

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.300 
combine the two and as you see now
creates<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> crafting<00:01:20.040> table<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.990> her<00:01:22.310> nothing
