and just open up so inside we have a
interesting<00:00:38.110> looking<00:00:39.480> io<00:00:40.480> guy<00:00:41.110> with<00:00:41.710> that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
interesting looking io guy with that

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.460 
interesting looking io guy with that
basically<00:00:42.490> two<00:00:42.730> eyes<00:00:42.910> which<00:00:43.270> are<00:00:43.510> two<00:00:44.080> two

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
basically two eyes which are two two

basically two eyes which are two two
webcams<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.440> adaptive<00:00:47.440> stand<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:48.100> idea

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
webcams and this adaptive stand the idea

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.730 
webcams and this adaptive stand the idea
is<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.580> we<00:00:48.880> can<00:00:49.120> sit<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.080> flat<00:00:50.320> on<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.590> table

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
is that we can sit it flat on the table

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.090 
is that we can sit it flat on the table
weaker<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:51.640> stand<00:00:52.000> up<00:00:52.180> on<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.420> table<00:00:52.810> or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
weaker and stand up on the table or

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.260 
weaker and stand up on the table or
using<00:00:54.100> these<00:00:54.190> hooks<00:00:54.460> we<00:00:54.580> can<00:00:54.730> actually<00:00:54.850> ever

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
using these hooks we can actually ever

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.510 
using these hooks we can actually ever
even<00:00:55.810> hook<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:56.320> on<00:00:56.440> top<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.740> mullet<00:00:57.010> or<00:00:57.130> wire

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
even hook it on top of a mullet or wire

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.690 
even hook it on top of a mullet or wire
or<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.790> laptop<00:00:58.120> screen<00:00:58.740> connect<00:00:59.740> over<00:00:59.950> USB<00:01:00.220> and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
or a laptop screen connect over USB and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.420 
or a laptop screen connect over USB and
as<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.420> say<00:01:01.630> effectively<00:01:02.290> just<00:01:02.530> you<00:01:03.280> know<00:01:03.370> two

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
as I say effectively just you know two

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.499 
as I say effectively just you know two
webcams<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.900> one<00:01:05.350> package<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:07.150> idea<00:01:07.450> is

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
webcams in one package there the idea is

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:08.940 
webcams in one package there the idea is
that<00:01:07.630> because<00:01:08.109> it<00:01:08.350> obvious<00:01:08.590> is<00:01:08.649> taking<00:01:08.890> a

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
that because it obvious is taking a

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.700 
that because it obvious is taking a
stereoscopic<00:01:09.460> view<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.170> record

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
stereoscopic view we can record

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.169 
stereoscopic view we can record
stereoscopic<00:01:12.640> images<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.509> using<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:15.179> 3d

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
stereoscopic images and using the 3d

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.209 
stereoscopic images and using the 3d
glasses<00:01:16.509> provided<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.530> these<00:01:17.829> are<00:01:18.009> red<00:01:18.189> blue

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
glasses provided and these are red blue

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.859 
glasses provided and these are red blue
3d<00:01:19.179> glasses<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:20.049> actually<00:01:20.429> show<00:01:21.429> off<00:01:21.579> a<00:01:22.090> 3d

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
3d glasses we can actually show off a 3d

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.830 
3d glasses we can actually show off a 3d
image<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.950> actually<00:01:24.249> get<00:01:24.429> five<00:01:24.789> 3d<00:01:25.600> glasses

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
image we actually get five 3d glasses

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.649 
image we actually get five 3d glasses
included<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:27.909> idea<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.179> that<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.479> know

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
included and the idea is that you know

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.330 
included and the idea is that you know
you<00:01:28.719> can<00:01:29.020> set<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.350> 3d<00:01:29.679> glasses<00:01:29.890> you<00:01:30.280> have

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
you can set in the 3d glasses you have

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.319 
you can set in the 3d glasses you have
two<00:01:30.579> friends<00:01:30.789> of<00:01:31.149> family<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.780> join<00:01:32.560> one<00:01:33.329> you

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
two friends of family and join one you

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.789 
two friends of family and join one you
know<00:01:34.389> web<00:01:34.630> conversations<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.530> everything

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
know web conversations and everything

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.639 
know web conversations and everything
else<00:01:35.950> or<00:01:36.159> even<00:01:36.189> send<00:01:36.639> them<00:01:36.759> photographs<00:01:37.329> or

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
else or even send them photographs or

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
email them images and videos so it's

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.569 
email them images and videos so it's
kind<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.899> cool<00:01:41.049> idea<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:41.710> it's<00:01:42.249> one<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
kind of a cool idea so it's one of the

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.010 
kind of a cool idea so it's one of the
first<00:01:42.819> times<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.240> we've<00:01:43.420> seen<00:01:43.659> something

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
YouTube take 3d snapshots and what's

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.280 
YouTube take 3d snapshots and what's
interesting<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:13.120> if<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.629> don't<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:13.959> 3d

you<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.260> watch<00:02:21.350> 3d<00:02:21.770> video<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:23.270> actually

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
you can watch 3d video we actually

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.170 
you can watch 3d video we actually
record<00:02:23.900> video<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.470> six<00:02:24.650> which<00:02:24.800> x<00:02:25.010> 480<00:02:25.460> that's

record video it six which x 480 that's
what<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.510> CMOS<00:02:26.810> sensor<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:27.620> can

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
what the CMOS sensor is but we can

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.130 
what the CMOS sensor is but we can
