00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello I hope you are super good I am 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 kilian and I'm very happy to be here 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.890
 again because mothers do not know no 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 I was able to upload videos and I apologize 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.400
 that's why what happens is that I have time 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
 to record only the weekend 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.839
 well last weekend I was very 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.050
 busy that I study too much because 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.240
 this week I was with some tests 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.010
 then it was only all the time of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 record me to be editing the video 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.849
 but here I am again and as you see in 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 the title I bring the tag that is my 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 backpack is something that I have been asked for and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.730
 that I wanted to do so we're going to 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.649
 start with the good video this is the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 rib that I use to go to the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.820
 I showed them to my university in my video 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.410
 hong of school supplies so that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 Some part of the screen I'm going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 leave in the information box 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 also because several of the things that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 I have here are the ones that I bought for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.399
 enter the university so if you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.380
 Interests like they can go see my 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.260
 another video but let's start let's 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.120
 with this pocket forward it's like the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.870
 it meant my loneliness is always in my 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 hands 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.070
 inside this bag but creating 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360
 mostly in my hands we will see that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.150
 there is good here 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.760
 The first thing is this card holder that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 llama gave it to me two years ago when 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.720
 I went to the university for the first time 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.520
 in antofagasta says catholic university 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.590
 I did not have carlos bringing all the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.690
 most important cards the card 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.910
 the college credential all 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.120
 everything also I have my hearing aids 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.010
 that they can not miss because if I do not 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.720
 bored of the micro what happens is that the 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.430
 distance between the university and my house 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.650
 it's a lot and I'm like more than half an hour 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 in the micro then that world gets bored 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.240
 although that always bores me in reality 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.220
 and I start listening to music or doing 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 something other than something I have here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.060
 so there I'll show you I have this 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.759
 taco of possible studies usually what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 I use at home to study but what 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.070
 I have here because this week I 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.290
 they asked in a bouquet because 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.000
 we did an activity or something 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.390
 so that's why I have it myself if 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.610
 I also have this I think brush for the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.620
 compact body had a tiny 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.869
 but I have no idea where it was like that 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.880
 that I have to use is crazy in my 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.130
 I love you but I committed critical issue 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.840
 and they have always brought her qaeda too 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.270
 I have these two little things 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.209
 This is a moisturizer or lip balm 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.190
 of iphone and him mentholatum that always 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.650
 I do it because I have the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.300
 very dry lips then always 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 I need to moisturize with something lately 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 he liked he was using many windows 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.110
 because I love how it feels like 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.360
 a refreshing feeling besides that I 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.750
 I like a lot of soil and it does not leave me like 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.920
 sensations and like sticky and that's why 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.020
 I have blue I do not know why I have it here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.260
 but until here this hand mirror or 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.819
 of bag that is very useful when 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.370
 fast I have these coins 700 pesos 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.189
 I think I have them here because what 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.319
 used for the passage and the latter these 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.970
 little pieces but do not believe is because I'm 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.860
 with china all that is ordered 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.110
 happens is that yesterday ended work with 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.260
 some of our colleagues inspire luck 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.760
 I entered in pieces of paper what we had 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.040
 introduce everyone then here I 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 my and I have the issues that attacked me 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.879
 to me and I did not want to vote because I knew 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.170
 that if I voted them later , I'm going to 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.450
 I lost what was my turn so 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.579
 I preferred to save them now let's 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.190
 move to the larger part the 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.980
 rosilla inside are little things not 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.819
 they are so many I think it's first they listen to me 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.859
 I have the nose wings color the marker 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.560
 pink and yellow the mine the 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.500
 comma corrector and all the essentials for 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.280
 classes I also have peaks medicare or 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.330
 that I have as the main course 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.350
 the compact powder mascara concealer a 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.500
 brush 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.720
 if you want me to make the tag of what's in 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.950
 my twin makeup bag 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.830
 view comments 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.870
 and then there are not many things but it 's like 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.300
 the essential thing that I use feels 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.760
 this cream that is for the face is 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.830
 also backpack for like a 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.870
 week worries is that I had like 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.840
 prescribed much to this part of the of the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.850
 face then like I was very uncomfortable 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.130
 that they use this cream that leaves me not 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.010
 he's just very rich and every time he felt 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.810
 as dry apart from throwing you threw me 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.760
 cream and that's why it did not come out anymore because 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.269
 I always use it to throw myself in 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.430
 hands to feel my color or when not 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.740
 There are soaps in the bathroom and I moisten the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.240
 hands in fact I also think apart from 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.880
 listen to music and another that I do when 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 I'm in the micro read this book that 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.210
 calls many lives many teachers of 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.210
 brian weiss is very good 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.150
 that we lack that in the video of hold of 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.520
 school material I said that I used 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.650
 agenda but believe me it has been very 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.270
 useful has served me quite took him 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.340
 always with me in the backpack because 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.140
 every time they give me a date of 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.180
 evaluation I notice directly here 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.120
 talking about the powers and more is 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.530
 quite because it always came as the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.050
 record what starts in the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.630
 week and so I 'm not going anything I have my 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.240
 notebooks these alone that I have already had 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.910
 in the backpack there will be this 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.680
 introduction into the economy and this 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.680
 supposedly it was from a bouquet that 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.410
 called identity and university but in 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.910
 that bouquet does not happen to us as well as mother 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.680
 to write we are constantly 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.220
 doing a job because he talks like 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.220
 mankind 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.240
 then I let it go to study 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.040
 I use a lot of colors and 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.220
 markers to study I love 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.720
 study like this look because at the moment of 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.580
 the test when I do not remember fast 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.100
 of something I try to remember like 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.800
 what colors were things or where did 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.800
 locate inside the notebook and so mmmm 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.450
 and so believe me they serve me so much for 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.720
 how to remember what I study and 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.090
