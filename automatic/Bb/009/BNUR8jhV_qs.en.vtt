00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 a tough Belgian how do we go 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 toasting on 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.109
 Trappist and thereby comes a little 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.330
 what sweeter spicy 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.360
 ratatouille we go this how we go 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.030
 nice filling I have a few red onions 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.949
 just put in the lemon cavities 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.340
 always nice for the freshness 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.730
 with chicken, cut it into quarters for a moment 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730
 is also in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.480
 I also cut a few slices when I 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.429
 my two need what we are going to do we are going 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.520
 protect that chest a bit 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.380
 drying out and at the same time 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.260
 we naturally have a lot of taste in the euro 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
 give by stuffing a bit with 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.700
 rony sees you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.700
 black pepper rosemary 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 I enjoy baking that I have 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.329
 mother 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.129
 taste it also gives a nice color 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.730
 when you get roasted 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.730
 best beer there 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.660
 in the small layer on the bottom of the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.390
 oven dish 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.220
 The chicken that we here in some grilling 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.269
 you do is you put the chicken on your chest 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.810
 turns it around 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.640
 because what I often do wrong in me 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.110
 the kitchen at home is that breast to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.759
 upstairs that goes backwards by it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 menu explains here in moisture 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.090
 stays nice and juicy on this side too 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.460
 just rub in a little bit 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.440
 with the herbs 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.610
 which can be put in the oven 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.820
 ratatouille we start with a dash 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.820
 olive oil 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.789
 shallots and garlic zucchini 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 shit 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.920
 use in many of my dishes 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.450
 I have a red pepper 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.290
 to give me a little pep feel 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.290
 almost delicious in everything 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.090
 In this case I use box spring garden 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 the mixture of thyme rosemary mint 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.700
 among other things for the sweetness 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.640
 a little cinnamon a little sea salt always 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.959
 nice in the ratatouille is frying it 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.820
 a little bit with those tastes we go 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:25.040
 then nice retreat still we go 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.970
 make something bigger that is a dash 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.970
 white wine to add 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.040
 little power 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.350
 by apple through to how you 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.720
 a little fresh basil start 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:45.200
 just scoop 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.580
 so good guys 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.530
 yes you can of course also on one 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.080
 plate or on a porcelain dish or 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 would present 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.959
 I think it is such a tough thing to just do 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.530
 that when you had good 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.530
 throw it around 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.349
 the grilled chicken with its sweetness that can 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.640
 talking you do 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.640
 we go eat the table tasty
