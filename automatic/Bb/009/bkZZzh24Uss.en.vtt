00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
normal typical knee-high boots I think

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.330 
normal typical knee-high boots I think
that<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.230> Andy<00:03:30.590> boots<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.010> i<00:03:31.069> showed<00:03:31.310> before

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that the Andy boots that i showed before

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.250 
that the Andy boots that i showed before
would<00:03:31.940> also<00:03:32.120> look<00:03:32.420> great<00:03:32.480> with<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:32.870> outfit

would also look great with this outfit

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.809 
would also look great with this outfit
if<00:03:33.440> you're<00:03:33.560> not<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.739> fan<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:34.010> knee<00:03:34.310> high<00:03:34.489> boots

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
if you're not a fan of knee high boots

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.270 
if you're not a fan of knee high boots
and<00:03:35.000> i<00:03:35.510> also<00:03:35.720> added<00:03:36.049> a<00:03:36.230> scarf<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.099> change

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
and i also added a scarf just to change

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.309 
and i also added a scarf just to change
it<00:03:37.489> up<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.819> think<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.209> cream<00:03:38.540> contrasts

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it up and I think the cream contrasts

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.140 
it up and I think the cream contrasts
really<00:03:39.680> well<00:03:39.829> with<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.099> black<00:03:40.310> because<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
really well with the black because it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.789 
really well with the black because it
