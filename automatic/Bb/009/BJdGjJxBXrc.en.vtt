to say the balance of the bike people
would<00:00:46.680> say<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.250> bike<00:00:47.399> looks<00:00:47.640> heavy<00:00:47.879> its

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
would say the bike looks heavy its

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.410 
would say the bike looks heavy its
aluminium<00:00:48.379> it<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.739> add<00:00:49.860> rides<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:51.149> feels

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
aluminium it really add rides it feels

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.240 
aluminium it really add rides it feels
like<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:51.930> kilos<00:00:52.260> lighter<00:00:52.469> coming<00:00:53.100> from

rides<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.630> well<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.140> we're<00:01:07.680> going

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
rides really really well and we're going

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
rides really really well and we're going
to<00:01:07.950> test<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.549> climbs<00:01:08.820> better<00:01:09.119> than

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to test that it climbs better than

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:31.510 
to test that it climbs better than
almost<00:01:09.659> anybody<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.260> there

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.620 

now<00:01:32.520> Ron's<00:01:32.730> been<00:01:32.910> speaking<00:01:33.210> about<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> x

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
now Ron's been speaking about the x

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
now Ron's been speaking about the x
factor<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.200> bike<00:01:34.440> and<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.920> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
factor of this bike and it really is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
factor of this bike and it really is
something<00:01:35.370> special<00:01:35.600> Patrick<00:01:36.600> more<00:01:36.750> wood<00:01:36.870> has

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
something special Patrick more wood has

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
something special Patrick more wood has
a<00:01:36.990> knack<00:01:37.230> of<00:01:37.260> getting<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.770> pivot<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.130> exactly

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
a knack of getting the pivot in exactly

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
a knack of getting the pivot in exactly
the<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.820> place<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.360> he<00:01:40.050> engineers<00:01:40.470> by<00:01:40.650> feel

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the right place and he engineers by feel

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.330 
the right place and he engineers by feel
as<00:01:41.160> well<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.760> by<00:01:41.910> technical<00:01:42.630> spec<00:01:42.870> so<00:01:43.530> with

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
as well as by technical spec so with

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.740 
as well as by technical spec so with
that<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.670> talent<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that kind of talent you can have a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.930 
that kind of talent you can have a
special<00:01:46.050> bike<00:01:46.200> no<00:01:46.410> doubt<00:01:46.620> on<00:01:47.430> paper<00:01:47.730> it's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
special bike no doubt on paper it's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.850 
special bike no doubt on paper it's
nothing<00:01:48.180> special<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.290> specs<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.620> nothing

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
nothing special the specs are nothing

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.650 
nothing special the specs are nothing
special<00:01:49.910> their<00:01:50.910> bikes<00:01:51.150> would<00:01:51.300> certainly<00:01:51.510> be

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
special their bikes would certainly be

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.660 
special their bikes would certainly be
towed<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.900> weight<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.770> somehow<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.340> rides

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
towed on weight but somehow it rides

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.400 
towed on weight but somehow it rides
lighter<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.350> think

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
lighter than it actually is and I think

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.260 
lighter than it actually is and I think
that<00:01:55.590> x-factor<00:01:56.070> gives<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.700> edge<00:01:56.820> over<00:01:57.060> its

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that x-factor gives it the edge over its

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.880 
that x-factor gives it the edge over its
competitors<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.140> were<00:01:58.200> choosing<00:01:58.410> back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
competitors when we were choosing back

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:15.000 
competitors when we were choosing back
of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> year

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
