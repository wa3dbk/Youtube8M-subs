00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this to turn into a debate although I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.140 
this to turn into a debate although I
will<00:01:04.500> mention<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.070> player<00:01:05.309> later<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> terms

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
will mention a player later on in terms

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
will mention a player later on in terms
of<00:01:06.330> clutch<00:01:06.660> ness<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:08.070> why<00:01:08.340> how<00:01:08.370> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
of clutch ness of when where why how a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
of clutch ness of when where why how a
player<00:01:09.240> gained<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:10.050> lost<00:01:10.080> his<00:01:10.770> clutch<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
player gained or lost his clutch but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
player gained or lost his clutch but
certainly<00:01:12.120> it<00:01:12.300> does<00:01:12.330> talk<00:01:12.720> about<00:01:12.750> players

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
certainly it does talk about players

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.160 
certainly it does talk about players
like<00:01:13.800> Mario<00:01:14.160> Manningham<00:01:14.460> Adam<00:01:15.210> Vinatieri<00:01:15.360> Tim

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
like Mario Manningham Adam Vinatieri Tim

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.680 
like Mario Manningham Adam Vinatieri Tim
Tebow<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.620> things<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:18.000> problem<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
Tebow and things like that the problem I

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.210 
Tebow and things like that the problem I
have<00:01:19.050> with<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.909> that<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.900> must<00:01:22.500> mean<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
have with this is that it must mean that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.030 
have with this is that it must mean that
the<00:01:23.640> static<00:01:24.120> ratings<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.870> game<00:01:25.140> become

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the static ratings in the game become

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.000 
the static ratings in the game become
moot<00:01:26.480> when<00:01:27.480> players<00:01:27.870> have<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.350> ability<00:01:28.620> and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
moot when players have this ability and

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.360 
moot when players have this ability and
that<00:01:29.730> means<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.390> theory<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> most

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
that means in theory you have the most

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.520 
that means in theory you have the most
important<00:01:32.940> aspect<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.540> game<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.229> ratings

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
important aspect of the game the ratings

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.060 
important aspect of the game the ratings
being<00:01:35.490> negated<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> point<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.290> cannot

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
being negated to a point we cannot

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
being negated to a point we cannot
physically<00:01:38.460> understand<00:01:39.229> simply<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
physically understand simply because the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.719 
physically understand simply because the
player<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.190> given<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.180> clutch<00:01:43.020> assignment<00:01:43.830> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
player is given a clutch assignment the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
player is given a clutch assignment the
other<00:01:44.880> problem<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.510> when<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.260> think

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
other problem I have is when you think

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
other problem I have is when you think
about<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> what's<00:01:47.280> affected<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
about this and what's affected to me it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
about this and what's affected to me it
really<00:01:48.900> lends<00:01:49.229> credence<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> scripted

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
really lends credence to the scripted

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
really lends credence to the scripted
gameplay<00:01:50.880> situation<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.570> mean<00:01:51.720> let's<00:01:51.900> realize

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
gameplay situation I mean let's realize

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.320 
gameplay situation I mean let's realize
that<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.159> late<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> fourth<00:01:54.090> quarter

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
that this is late in the fourth quarter

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.719 
that this is late in the fourth quarter
