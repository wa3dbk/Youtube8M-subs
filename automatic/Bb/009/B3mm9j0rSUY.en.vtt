00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
is the greenhouse update me that here it

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.030 
is the greenhouse update me that here it
is<00:00:07.130> 8:30<00:00:08.740> maybe<00:00:09.740> four<00:00:10.460> five<00:00:10.970> hours<00:00:11.000> later

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
is 8:30 maybe four five hours later

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.880 
is 8:30 maybe four five hours later
working<00:00:13.040> on<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:14.260> yeah<00:00:15.260> I<00:00:15.410> have<00:00:15.530> to<00:00:15.620> go<00:00:15.710> back

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
working on it yeah I have to go back

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.100 
working on it yeah I have to go back
into<00:00:16.099> the<00:00:16.309> cover<00:00:16.550> of<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.900> bamboo<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.680> see<00:00:18.890> it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
into the cover of the bamboo to see it

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.550 
into the cover of the bamboo to see it
got<00:00:21.110> a<00:00:21.170> frame<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.039> door<00:00:24.010> has<00:00:25.010> 11<00:00:25.730> ribs<00:00:26.560> of

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
got a frame that the door has 11 ribs of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.609 
got a frame that the door has 11 ribs of
bamboo<00:00:28.660> we'll<00:00:29.660> go<00:00:29.779> into<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.140> green

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
bamboo we'll go into the green

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.669 
bamboo we'll go into the green
no<00:00:31.369> plastic<00:00:31.609> yet<00:00:32.979> give<00:00:33.979> it<00:00:34.069> a<00:00:34.129> window<00:00:35.559> right<00:00:36.559> as

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
no plastic yet give it a window right as

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.549 
no plastic yet give it a window right as
well<00:00:36.859> it's<00:00:37.309> easy<00:00:37.519> to<00:00:37.609> make<00:00:38.109> everything<00:00:39.109> is<00:00:39.350> zip

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
well it's easy to make everything is zip

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.660 
well it's easy to make everything is zip
tied<00:00:40.569> these<00:00:41.569> pieces<00:00:41.899> aren't<00:00:42.429> naturally<00:00:43.429> long

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
tied these pieces aren't naturally long

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.610 
tied these pieces aren't naturally long
enough<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.589> if<00:00:45.589> you<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.889> see<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:47.319> zip<00:00:48.319> tied

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
enough so if you can see that zip tied

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.619 
enough so if you can see that zip tied
in<00:00:49.339> three<00:00:49.549> places

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:00.099 

so<00:00:53.629> it's<00:00:53.870> stretched<00:00:57.159> and<00:00:58.159> then<00:00:59.149> got<00:00:59.839> a<00:00:59.869> ridge

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
so it's stretched and then got a ridge

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.189 
so it's stretched and then got a ridge
pole<00:01:00.440> over<00:01:00.679> there<00:01:01.239> got<00:01:02.239> them<00:01:02.420> anchored<00:01:02.959> to<00:01:02.989> the

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
pole over there got them anchored to the

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.460 
pole over there got them anchored to the
ground<00:01:04.420> tonight<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.630> looks<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:06.320> going

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
ground tonight it looks like it's going

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.790 
ground tonight it looks like it's going
to<00:01:06.530> blow<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.070> rain<00:01:08.020> maybe<00:01:09.020> tomorrow<00:01:09.500> or

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
to blow and rain maybe tomorrow or

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.740 
to blow and rain maybe tomorrow or
Monday<00:01:09.980> we<00:01:10.310> get<00:01:10.460> plastic<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.240> got<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.510> do<00:01:11.570> some

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
Monday we get plastic I got to do some

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.810 
Monday we get plastic I got to do some
research<00:01:12.520> but<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:14.540> should<00:01:14.900> harden<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.860> this

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
research but it should harden in this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.810 
research but it should harden in this
shape<00:01:17.090> that's<00:01:17.780> part<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> test<00:01:18.580> will<00:01:19.580> the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
shape that's part of the test will the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.680 
shape that's part of the test will the
bamboo<00:01:20.210> naturally<00:01:20.900> harden<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.950> shape

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
bamboo naturally harden in this shape

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.270 
bamboo naturally harden in this shape
since<00:01:23.690> it's<00:01:23.930> green<00:01:24.260> it's<00:01:24.650> easier<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.070> cut

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
since it's green it's easier to cut

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.810 
since it's green it's easier to cut
easier<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.850> mold<00:01:26.690> easier<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.440> bend<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:28.640> old

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
easier to mold easier to bend that old

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.120 
easier to mold easier to bend that old
stuff<00:01:29.120> over<00:01:29.420> there<00:01:29.570> has<00:01:29.660> been<00:01:29.840> sitting<00:01:30.110> out<00:01:30.320> it

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
stuff over there has been sitting out it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.870 
stuff over there has been sitting out it
breaks<00:01:31.460> right<00:01:31.610> up<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:33.380> maybe<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.400> goal<00:01:34.580> also

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
breaks right up so maybe the goal also

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.440 
breaks right up so maybe the goal also
is<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.270> get<00:01:35.390> plastic<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:36.050> here<00:01:36.200> quickly<00:01:36.680> but

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
is to get plastic going here quickly but

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.710 
is to get plastic going here quickly but
can't<00:01:38.450> do<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.720> tonight<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:41.420> gonna<00:01:41.510> have<00:01:41.690> to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
can't do it tonight so I'm gonna have to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.360 
can't do it tonight so I'm gonna have to
figure<00:01:41.930> out<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.140> way<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.350> do<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.620> too<00:01:42.920> because<00:01:43.130> I

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
figure out a way to do it too because I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.690 
figure out a way to do it too because I
got<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> tape<00:01:44.210> over<00:01:44.890> some<00:01:45.940> some<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:48.130> these

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.539 

focus<00:01:53.400> focus<00:01:54.400> focus<00:01:56.549> more<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.860> that's<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.189> sharp

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
focus focus focus more so that's a sharp

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.590 
focus focus focus more so that's a sharp
tine<00:02:01.299> right<00:02:01.600> there<00:02:02.430> from<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.729> cutting<00:02:04.479> off

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
tine right there from the cutting off

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.660 
tine right there from the cutting off
the<00:02:05.159> leaves<00:02:06.159> I<00:02:08.100> don't<00:02:09.100> know<00:02:09.190> if<00:02:09.340> it'll<00:02:09.459> mess

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
the leaves I don't know if it'll mess

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.340 
the leaves I don't know if it'll mess
with<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.910> plastic<00:02:10.270> or<00:02:10.390> not<00:02:10.539> but<00:02:10.810> we'll<00:02:11.140> see

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
with the plastic or not but we'll see

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.640 
with the plastic or not but we'll see
well<00:02:11.860> here's<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.100> better<00:02:12.250> example<00:02:19.470> all<00:02:20.470> right

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
well here's a better example all right

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.979 
well here's a better example all right
well<00:02:21.459> maybe<00:02:21.730> tomorrow<00:02:22.030> we'll<00:02:22.300> get<00:02:22.390> plastic<00:02:22.870> if

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
well maybe tomorrow we'll get plastic if

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.559 
well maybe tomorrow we'll get plastic if
it's<00:02:23.110> still<00:02:23.319> standing

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
it's still standing

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.780 
it's still standing
thanks<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:25.690> watching
