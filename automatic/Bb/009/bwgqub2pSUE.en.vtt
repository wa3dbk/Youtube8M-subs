warehouses worth of storage so simply

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.050 
warehouses worth of storage so simply
ate<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.830> dinosaurs<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.430> that's<00:04:28.550> definitely

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
ate the dinosaurs and that's definitely

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670 
ate the dinosaurs and that's definitely
how<00:04:29.180> they<00:04:29.330> became<00:04:29.570> extinct<00:04:30.140> finally<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.560> ark

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
how they became extinct finally the ark

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.410 
how they became extinct finally the ark
came<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.919> rest

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
came to rest

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.760

the mountains of ararat and there was

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.290 
the mountains of ararat and there was

much rejoicing until they realize how to
suck<00:04:34.510> up<00:04:34.630> a<00:04:34.690> fucking<00:04:35.050> mountain<00:04:35.380> with<00:04:35.500> various
