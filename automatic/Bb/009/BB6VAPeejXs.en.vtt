ever<00:01:32.030> video<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.049> tell<00:01:33.290> me<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.440> little<00:01:33.560> bit<00:01:33.710> about

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
ever video so tell me a little bit about

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.700 
ever video so tell me a little bit about
the<00:01:34.580> differences<00:01:35.030> in<00:01:35.179> those<00:01:35.270> colors<00:01:35.509> well<00:01:36.470> one

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the differences in those colors well one

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.499 
the differences in those colors well one
of<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.860> things<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.190> we<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.670> thermal

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
of the things is we have a thermal

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.999 
of the things is we have a thermal
thermal<00:01:38.840> resistive<00:01:39.380> high<00:01:39.530> temperature

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
thermal resistive high temperature

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.650

ceramic<00:01:40.610> coating<00:01:40.880> that<00:01:40.940> we're<00:01:41.060> placing<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
ceramic coating that we're placing so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.290 
ceramic coating that we're placing so
durability<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.320> great<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:43.550> in<00:01:43.940> some<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
durability is great and in some of the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.850 
durability is great and in some of the
applications<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.929> found<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.350> obviously<00:01:45.679> as

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
applications we found that obviously as

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.779 
applications we found that obviously as
we<00:01:45.890> move<00:01:46.130> towards<00:01:46.429> some<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.700> new

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
we move towards some of the new

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.490 
we move towards some of the new
higher-end<00:01:47.270> vehicles<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:47.960> some<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.409> our

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
higher-end vehicles and some of our

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.109 
higher-end vehicles and some of our

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
diverse components in the European side

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.760 
diverse components in the European side
we<00:01:50.690> found<00:01:50.899> guys<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.320> want<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.649> have

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
we found guys that really want to have

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.320 
we found guys that really want to have
the<00:01:51.890> entire<00:01:52.130> system<00:01:52.429> coated<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.000> more<00:01:53.179> of<00:01:53.240> an

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
the entire system coated it's more of an

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.270 
the entire system coated it's more of an
aesthetic<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.530> we've<00:01:54.679> gone<00:01:54.830> through<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.159> use

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
aesthetic so we've gone through and use

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.440 
aesthetic so we've gone through and use
that<00:01:55.310> same<00:01:55.610> hoodie<00:01:55.880> we've<00:01:56.030> applied<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.420> our

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
that same hoodie we've applied to our

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.540 
that same hoodie we've applied to our
headers<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.140> apply<00:01:57.679> that<00:01:57.830> same<00:01:58.009> titanium

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
portion of what we're doing but now it's

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
portion of what we're doing but now it's
a<00:02:08.979> bit<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.160> an<00:02:09.250> aesthetic<00:02:09.490> now<00:02:10.210> what<00:02:10.390> are<00:02:10.479> some

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
a bit of an aesthetic now what are some

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.240 
a bit of an aesthetic now what are some
of<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> challenges<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:11.710> coming<00:02:12.100> up<00:02:12.190> with

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
of the challenges of coming up with

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.610 
of the challenges of coming up with
systems<00:02:12.910> for<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.180> new<00:02:13.540> cars<00:02:13.810> maybe<00:02:14.380> some

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
systems for the new cars maybe some

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.580 
systems for the new cars maybe some
exhaust<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> most<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:16.030> now<00:02:16.660> it's<00:02:16.780> not<00:02:16.930> yeah

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
exhaust as the most to now it's not yeah

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.690 
exhaust as the most to now it's not yeah
well<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.610> many

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
well actually there are so many

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.550 
well actually there are so many
components<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.420> an<00:02:19.510> exhaust<00:02:19.810> system<00:02:19.900> now<00:02:20.320> that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
components to an exhaust system now that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
components to an exhaust system now that
have<00:02:21.010> changed<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.850> used<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.150> like

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
have changed that what used to be like

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.880 
have changed that what used to be like
you<00:02:22.540> said<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.900> tubing<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> get<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> exhaust

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you said just tubing to get the exhaust

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.290 
you said just tubing to get the exhaust
from<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.250> front<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.640> car<00:02:24.850> out<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> back

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
from the front of the car out the back

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.210 
from the front of the car out the back
of<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.570> car<00:02:25.780> has<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.380> been<00:02:26.590> ok<00:02:26.890> well<00:02:27.070> now<00:02:27.190> we

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
of the car has now been ok well now we

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.800 
of the car has now been ok well now we
got<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> mitigating<00:02:27.850> noise<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.420> we<00:02:28.630> got

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
got a mitigating noise because we got

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.150 
got a mitigating noise because we got
multiple<00:02:29.020> cylinder<00:02:29.560> dropping<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.100> you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
multiple cylinder dropping you know you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.070 
multiple cylinder dropping you know you
have<00:02:30.280> eh<00:02:30.550> running<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.210> saunders<00:02:31.480> that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
have eh running as for saunders that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.720 
have eh running as for saunders that
completely<00:02:32.440> changes<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.920> exhaust<00:02:33.250> dynamic

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
completely changes the exhaust dynamic

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.490 
completely changes the exhaust dynamic
on<00:02:34.180> top<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.690> well<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.960> got<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> car<00:02:35.350> that

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
on top of that well you got a car that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.860 
on top of that well you got a car that
made<00:02:35.650> 400<00:02:36.130> course<00:02:36.280> crowd<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.820> idle<00:02:37.420> mode<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.840> in

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
made 400 course crowd in idle mode or in

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.360 
made 400 course crowd in idle mode or in
the<00:02:38.110> horse<00:02:38.440> loaner<00:02:38.680> modes<00:02:38.830> only<00:02:39.070> making<00:02:39.220> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the horse loaner modes only making a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.250 
the horse loaner modes only making a
third<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.820> power<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.390> how<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.110> make

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
third of that power so how do you make

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.199 
third of that power so how do you make
that<00:02:41.290> officially<00:02:42.010> exit<00:02:42.370> not<00:02:42.550> podmore<00:02:43.030> back

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
that officially exit not podmore back

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.750 
that officially exit not podmore back
pressure<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.810> again<00:02:44.500> valve<00:02:44.770> systems<00:02:45.280> that's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
pressure so again valve systems that's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.010 
pressure so again valve systems that's
been<00:02:45.910> something<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.420> seem<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.750> lot<00:02:46.930> of

Carson<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.440> did<00:02:56.770> notice<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.310> some<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
Carson I did notice on some of the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970 
Carson I did notice on some of the
systems<00:02:58.060> hanging<00:02:58.390> on<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.570> walls<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:59.110> you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
systems hanging on the walls that you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.290 
systems hanging on the walls that you
stepped<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.490> clamps<00:03:00.790> little<00:03:01.000> bit<00:03:01.120> too<00:03:01.240> i'm

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
stepped up the clamps little bit too i'm

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.240 
stepped up the clamps little bit too i'm
susan<00:03:01.570> b<00:03:01.750> bands<00:03:02.020> yeah<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.800> over<00:03:02.920> higher<00:03:03.040> end

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
susan b bands yeah so it over higher end

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.680 
susan b bands yeah so it over higher end
systems<00:03:03.580> we're<00:03:03.700> also<00:03:03.850> offering<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.360> Eve<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
systems we're also offering of Eve and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
systems we're also offering of Eve and
clamp<00:03:04.930> now<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.200> allows<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.500> little<00:03:05.800> bit<00:03:05.890> more

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
clamp now this allows a little bit more

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440 
clamp now this allows a little bit more
adjustability<00:03:06.520> but<00:03:06.850> at<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.000> same<00:03:07.209> time<00:03:07.390> a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
adjustability but at the same time a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.570 
adjustability but at the same time a
more<00:03:07.720> precise<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.080> bit<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.530> lot<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.070> times<00:03:09.250> having

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
more precise a bit a lot of times having

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.130 
more precise a bit a lot of times having
too<00:03:09.700> much<00:03:09.820> adjustability<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.660> leads<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
too much adjustability it leads to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.080 
too much adjustability it leads to
interference<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.310> here<00:03:12.640> we're<00:03:12.790> taking<00:03:13.030> that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
interference so here we're taking that

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.790 
interference so here we're taking that
variable<00:03:13.510> out<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.930> didn't<00:03:14.260> increase<00:03:14.500> costs

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
variable out I didn't increase costs

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.229 
variable out I didn't increase costs
obviously<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> VBA<00:03:15.610> claps<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:16.000> little<00:03:16.150> bit

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
obviously the VBA claps a little bit

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.180 
obviously the VBA claps a little bit
better<00:03:16.330> sealing<00:03:16.660> but<00:03:17.410> at<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.560> same<00:03:17.769> time<00:03:17.980> it

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
better sealing but at the same time it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.259 
better sealing but at the same time it
cost<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.459> little<00:03:18.550> bit<00:03:18.640> more<00:03:18.850> put<00:03:19.060> into<00:03:19.209> the

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
cost a little bit more put into the

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.130 
cost a little bit more put into the
system

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
system

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.870 
system
you<00:03:20.800> can<00:03:20.920> put<00:03:21.040> together<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.430> take<00:03:21.550> apart

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
you can put together and take apart

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.730 
you can put together and take apart
infinitely<00:03:22.360> another<00:03:22.750> three<00:03:23.020> but<00:03:23.319> no<00:03:23.590> we're

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
infinitely another three but no we're

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.710 
infinitely another three but no we're
agreeing<00:03:24.280> or<00:03:24.610> anything<00:03:24.940> yeah<00:03:25.090> now<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.569> other

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
agreeing or anything yeah now the other

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.570 
agreeing or anything yeah now the other
thing<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.930> wanted<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.170> ask<00:03:26.230> about<00:03:26.440> last<00:03:27.310> year
