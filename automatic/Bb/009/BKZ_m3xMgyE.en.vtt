what I like about this course the most

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.410 
what I like about this course the most
is<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> terrain<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.180> come

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
is just the terrain I like that you come

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.500 
is just the terrain I like that you come
to<00:02:11.540> Florida<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:13.940> elevation

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
to Florida and you get to see elevation

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
to Florida and you get to see elevation
changes<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.380> makes<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.800> throw<00:02:16.010> low<00:02:16.340> power

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
changes it makes you throw low power

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820 
changes it makes you throw low power
shots<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.810> can't<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:18.260> go<00:02:18.440> over-the-top

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
shots you can't really go over-the-top

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920 
shots you can't really go over-the-top
too<00:02:19.280> much<00:02:19.490> or<00:02:19.820> around<00:02:20.120> stuff<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
too much or around stuff because of the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.320 
too much or around stuff because of the
mandos<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.820> give<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.300> a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
mandos so I like that they give you a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.240 
mandos so I like that they give you a
hole<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.320> hit<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.530> hole<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
hole and you have to hit that hole I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
hole and you have to hit that hole I
just<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.820> challenge<00:02:26.000> of<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.570> that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
just like the challenge of it and that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.880 
just like the challenge of it and that
the<00:02:26.870> fact<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.170> you're<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.770> have

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
the fact that you're you know you have

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.080
