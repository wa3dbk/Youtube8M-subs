00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.690 
spurning I've been spurning 3d
technology<00:00:10.469> I'm<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.740> ready<00:00:10.920> for<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.160> glasses

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
technology I'm not ready for the glasses

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.450 
technology I'm not ready for the glasses
I'm<00:00:11.940> not<00:00:12.120> ready<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.019> expensive<00:00:13.530> TV<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.190> I

I'm not ready for the expensive TV and I

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.099 
I'm not ready for the expensive TV and I
frankly<00:00:14.969> don't<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.450> everybody<00:00:15.839> wants<00:00:15.990> to

know the awkwardness doing it he's
explaining<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.670> how<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> 3d<00:00:21.270> technology

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
explaining here how the 3d technology

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.870 
explaining here how the 3d technology
works<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.260> 3d<00:00:22.500> glasses<00:00:22.529> 3d<00:00:23.100> glasses<00:00:23.460> use

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
works with 3d glasses 3d glasses use

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.410 
works with 3d glasses 3d glasses use
polarized<00:00:24.420> light<00:00:24.859> or<00:00:25.859> they<00:00:26.609> actually<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.240> do

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
polarized light or they actually can do

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.880 
polarized light or they actually can do
thing<00:00:27.689> where<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.930> turn<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.500> eye<00:00:28.529> than

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
thing where they turn off one eye than

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
thing where they turn off one eye than
the<00:00:29.130> other<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:29.880> riding<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> other

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
end up being like the 3d technology the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
end up being like the 3d technology the
future<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> remember<00:01:23.490> how

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
