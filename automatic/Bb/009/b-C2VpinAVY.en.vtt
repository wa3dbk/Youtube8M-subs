what<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:10.970> even<00:02:11.120> make<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:11.959> couple<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.380> analogies

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
what I even make a couple of analogies

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.470 
what I even make a couple of analogies
here<00:02:13.010> with<00:02:13.370> other<00:02:13.550> activities<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.300> other

here with other activities in other
sports<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:16.010> which<00:02:16.310> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:18.050> see<00:02:18.110> what

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
sports in which if you can see what

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.350 
sports in which if you can see what
would<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.190> happening<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:19.880> you<00:02:20.120> would

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
would be happening if you would

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.960 
would be happening if you would

you're able to point forward see the
racket<00:03:38.310> comes<00:03:38.489> back<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.030> further<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:40.470> once

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
racket comes back here further so once

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.830
