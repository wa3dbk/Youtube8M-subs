how fast were you going at that time I
haven't<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.850> quite<00:00:42.120> found<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> exact

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
haven't really quite found out the exact

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
haven't really quite found out the exact
speed<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.829> I've<00:00:44.010> heard<00:00:44.160> 190<00:00:45.059> summer<00:00:45.420> air<00:00:45.600> 1

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
speed but I've heard 190 summer air 1

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
speed but I've heard 190 summer air 1
198<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.430> banged<00:00:47.670> around<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
198 so you get banged around at that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.029 
198 so you get banged around at that
speed<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.780> bad<00:00:48.989> enough<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> car

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
speed it's bad enough but then the car

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.490 
speed it's bad enough but then the car
goes<00:00:50.340> airborne<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> even<00:00:51.870> begin<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
goes airborne can you even begin to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
back on the ground I was thinking it was

the crash was actually the very end when
the<00:01:24.420> two<00:01:24.570> cars<00:01:24.840> slid<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.320> me<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.670> was

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the two cars slid into me but it was

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.920 
the two cars slid into me but it was
pretty<00:01:27.000> cool<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> pit<00:01:27.810> crew

that they have the car now and they'll

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.970 
that they have the car now and they'll
be<00:03:09.210> looking<00:03:09.480> at<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.020> what<00:03:10.230> happened

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
be looking at it and see what happened

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.760 
be looking at it and see what happened
the<00:03:11.100> right<00:03:11.280> way<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:12.300> think<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.990> know<00:03:13.140> for<00:03:13.650> this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the right way I think you know for this

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.840 
the right way I think you know for this
type<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.130> racing<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.460> know<00:03:14.580> we<00:03:14.670> probably

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
type of racing you know we probably

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.250 
type of racing you know we probably
could<00:03:15.120> bring<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.420> speed<00:03:15.630> down<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.080> bit

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
could bring the speed down a little bit

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.590 
could bring the speed down a little bit
and<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.190> same<00:03:17.430> style<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> racing<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.510> we

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and get the same style of racing that we

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.500 
and get the same style of racing that we
want<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.020> out<00:03:19.140> there<00:03:19.380> for<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.920> fans

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
want to see out there for the fans

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.610 
want to see out there for the fans
obviously<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:21.630> don't<00:03:21.690> want<00:03:21.900> cars<00:03:22.110> getting<00:03:22.530> in

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
obviously we don't want cars getting in

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.620 
obviously we don't want cars getting in
the<00:03:22.680> air<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.370> we'll<00:03:23.760> work<00:03:23.880> hard<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.600> that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
the air so we'll work hard to do that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.740 
the air so we'll work hard to do that
and<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.080> think<00:03:25.140> NASCAR<00:03:25.470> has<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:25.920> people<00:03:26.750> around

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
and I think NASCAR has the people around

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.840 
and I think NASCAR has the people around
them<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.680> make<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> right<00:03:29.130> restrictor

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
them to to make the right restrictor

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.120 
them to to make the right restrictor
plate<00:03:30.120> racing<00:03:30.600> keeps<00:03:30.870> cars<00:03:31.170> bunched<00:03:31.740> very

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
plate racing keeps cars bunched very

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.730 
plate racing keeps cars bunched very
tightly<00:03:32.520> together<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.240> high<00:03:33.390> speeds<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.110> that

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
tightly together at high speeds is that

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.150 
tightly together at high speeds is that
something<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.520> continue<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.130> I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
something that can continue you know I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.560 
something that can continue you know I
think<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.580> think<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
think I think we like to see the the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.660 
think I think we like to see the the
tight<00:03:39.990> racing<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> pack<00:03:40.770> type<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.220> racing<00:03:41.550> is

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
tight racing the pack type of racing is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.250 
tight racing the pack type of racing is
is<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.390> cool<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.840> fans<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.230> watch

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
is is it's cool for the fans to watch

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.199 
is is it's cool for the fans to watch
it's<00:03:43.650> fun<00:03:43.890> for<00:03:44.100> our<00:03:44.130> drivers<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.880> part<00:03:45.120> of

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
it's fun for our drivers to be a part of

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.880 
it's fun for our drivers to be a part of
it<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> hardest<00:03:46.680> part

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
it I think I think the hardest part

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.220 
it I think I think the hardest part
though<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.640> don't<00:03:47.790> need<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.120> speed<00:03:48.660> where

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
though is you don't need the speed where

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.830 
though is you don't need the speed where
we<00:03:49.320> catch<00:03:49.530> air<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.390> pretty<00:03:51.630> tough

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
we catch air so it's it's pretty tough

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.900 
we catch air so it's it's pretty tough
decisions<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:52.890> make<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.220> know<00:03:53.310> we<00:03:53.459> signed<00:03:53.700> up
