something on my own and I was and I was
mortified<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:18.090> leave<00:05:18.319> respawn<00:05:19.319> at<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:19.650> time

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
mortified to leave respawn at the time

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.230 
mortified to leave respawn at the time
that<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:19.949> did<00:05:20.159> because<00:05:20.430> like<00:05:20.759> I<00:05:20.849> said<00:05:21.030> yesterday

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
that I did because like I said yesterday

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.809 
that I did because like I said yesterday
I<00:05:21.509> felt<00:05:21.840> like<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.259> felt<00:05:23.039> like<00:05:23.099> I<00:05:23.280> helped<00:05:23.550> build

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
I felt like I felt like I helped build

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.760 
I felt like I felt like I helped build
that<00:05:23.909> channel<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.599> so<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:24.840> had<00:05:25.349> so<00:05:25.590> much

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
that channel and so I had so much

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.430 
that channel and so I had so much
invested<00:05:25.979> in<00:05:26.400> it<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.539> decision

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
invested in it and so the the decision

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.800 
invested in it and so the the decision
to<00:05:28.500> walk<00:05:28.680> away<00:05:28.860> from<00:05:29.129> it<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:30.360> also<00:05:30.479> felt

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
to walk away from it and it also felt

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.269 
to walk away from it and it also felt
like<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:30.990> was<00:05:31.110> letting<00:05:31.289> my<00:05:31.529> co-workers<00:05:32.069> down

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:32.279 
like I was letting my co-workers down

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.740 
like I was letting my co-workers down
and<00:05:32.550> letting<00:05:32.669> sark<00:05:33.029> down<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.509> even<00:05:33.659> though

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
and letting sark down and even though

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.939 
and letting sark down and even though
that's<00:05:33.870> not<00:05:33.990> how<00:05:34.169> he<00:05:34.229> felt<00:05:34.500> at<00:05:34.620> all<00:05:34.710> he<00:05:34.860> was

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
that's not how he felt at all he was

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.670 
that's not how he felt at all he was
extremely<00:05:35.699> extremely<00:05:36.300> supportive<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.169> me

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
extremely extremely supportive of me

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.559 
extremely extremely supportive of me
doing<00:05:37.860> whatever<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.279> need<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.550> do<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.819> to<00:05:39.419> stay

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
doing whatever I need to do to to stay

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.999

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
happy and healthy and all that stuff he

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.659 
happy and healthy and all that stuff he
never<00:05:41.190> once<00:05:41.460> tried<00:05:41.759> to<00:05:42.000> try<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.610> try<00:05:44.610> to

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
never once tried to try to try to

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.129 
never once tried to try to try to
guilt-trip<00:05:45.120> me<00:05:45.270> or<00:05:45.449> anything<00:05:45.599> like<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:45.870> but

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
guilt-trip me or anything like that but

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.769 
guilt-trip me or anything like that but
I<00:05:46.169> was<00:05:46.319> just<00:05:46.969> mortified<00:05:47.969> of<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.449> effect<00:05:48.719> that

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
I was just mortified of the effect that

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:49.969 
I was just mortified of the effect that
it<00:05:48.930> does<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.199> ripple<00:05:49.469> effect<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:49.919> would

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
it does the ripple effect that it would

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.370 
it does the ripple effect that it would
have<00:05:50.219> and<00:05:50.580> some<00:05:51.569> of<00:05:51.599> it<00:05:51.810> was<00:05:51.930> unrealistic

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
have and some of it was unrealistic

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.469 
have and some of it was unrealistic
there<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.860> then<00:05:52.949> some<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.219> it<00:05:53.310> was<00:05:53.430> very<00:05:53.639> very

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
there and then some of it was very very

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.159 
there and then some of it was very very
practical<00:05:54.719> things<00:05:55.529> worth<00:05:55.830> considering<00:05:56.340> and

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
practical things worth considering and

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.689 
practical things worth considering and
it<00:05:58.169> looks<00:05:58.409> like<00:05:58.500> I've<00:05:58.770> run<00:05:58.979> out<00:05:59.039> of<00:05:59.190> time<00:05:59.400> once

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699
