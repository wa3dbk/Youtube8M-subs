might learn he whips naturally the name
it<00:00:13.320> doesn't<00:00:13.740> imply<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> use

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
it doesn't imply that you have to use

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.129 
it doesn't imply that you have to use
your<00:00:14.849> heels<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.269> kick<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> or<00:00:15.660> anything<00:00:15.839> just

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
your heels to kick it or anything just

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.200 
your heels to kick it or anything just
stand<00:00:16.529> normally<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.760> keep<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.180> way

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
stand normally just keep it that way

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.580 
stand normally just keep it that way
it's<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.869> called<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> heel<00:00:19.230> up<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.500> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's just called a heel up because it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.439 
it's just called a heel up because it
comes<00:00:19.740> from<00:00:19.800> heel<00:00:20.070> foot<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.460> skate<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:20.910> all

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
comes from heel foot we skate for all

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
comes from heel foot we skate for all
right<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.189> take<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
right so just like that take it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340 
right so just like that take it
sometimes<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.539> use<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.840> foot<00:00:25.109> behind

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
sometimes you can use your foot behind

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
sometimes you can use your foot behind
the<00:00:25.590> brake<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.949> don't<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.580> guess<00:00:26.730> some

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the brake I don't but I guess some

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.300 
the brake I don't but I guess some
people<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.359> like<00:00:27.710> any<00:00:28.710> whip<00:00:28.920> trick<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
people do that like any whip trick you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.529 
people do that like any whip trick you
got<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.580> practicing<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> motion<00:00:30.420> that's

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
got to be practicing the motion that's

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.970 
got to be practicing the motion that's
gonna<00:00:30.660> be<00:00:30.840> an<00:00:31.590> opposite<00:00:32.420> turn<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.600> purus<00:00:33.980> than

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
gonna be an opposite turn of purus than

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.630 
gonna be an opposite turn of purus than
normal<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.380> let's<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.860> guess<00:00:38.340> that's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
normal and let's see I guess that's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
normal and let's see I guess that's
practice<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.410> front<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
practice just have it in front of you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.130 
practice just have it in front of you
toe<00:00:40.890> side<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.760> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> user<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.930> foot

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
toe side then kind of user back foot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.549 
toe side then kind of user back foot
kick<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.760> practice<00:00:44.760> learning<00:00:44.969> mostly<00:00:45.930> you're

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
kick it practice learning mostly you're

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
kick it practice learning mostly you're
either<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.980> flat<00:00:47.370> fly<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.420> maybe

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
either gonna be flat fly out or maybe

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
either gonna be flat fly out or maybe
I'm<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> bang<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.590> where<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I'm a bang because that's where I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.110 
I'm a bang because that's where I
learned<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.399> probably<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.850> as

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
learned it but that's probably not as

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
learned it but that's probably not as
likely<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.660> wouldn't<00:00:52.079> advise<00:00:52.890> doing<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.340> like

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
likely I wouldn't advise doing it like

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.319 
likely I wouldn't advise doing it like
over<00:00:54.329> him<00:00:54.539> or<00:00:55.129> air<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.160> anything<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> needs<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
over him or air or anything that needs a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.599 
over him or air or anything that needs a
rotation<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.079> try<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> straight<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
rotation just try to do it straight so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.439 
rotation just try to do it straight so
flat

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
flat

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.849 
flat
you're<00:01:00.899> probably<00:01:00.989> gonna<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.770> right

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you're probably gonna do it all right

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.770 
you're probably gonna do it all right
kick<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.520> both<00:01:02.730> feet<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.420> might<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kick with both feet you might need a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.350 
kick with both feet you might need a
little<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.409> muscle<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:06.180> not

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
little bit more muscle and it's not

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
little bit more muscle and it's not
necessarily<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.130> don't<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
necessarily I'm like you don't have to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
necessarily I'm like you don't have to
put<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> much<00:01:08.880> force<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.540> cuz<00:01:09.689> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
put that much force into it cuz it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
put that much force into it cuz it's
really<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.830> harder<00:01:11.159> than<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> whip

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really not that much harder than a whip

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
really not that much harder than a whip
it's<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.150> used<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:12.930> yeah

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's just you're not used to it but yeah

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.550 
it's just you're not used to it but yeah
basically<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.369> kick<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.060> both<00:01:15.270> feet<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> then

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
basically I kick with both feet and then

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
basically I kick with both feet and then
catch<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.009> both<00:01:17.220> feet<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.490> might<00:01:17.820> end<00:01:18.060> up

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
catch with both feet you might end up

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990 
catch with both feet you might end up
catching<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.630> little<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.000> front

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
catching a little bit with the front

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.200 
catching a little bit with the front
foot<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.020> gonna<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:23.210> know

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
foot because it's gonna be there I know

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
foot because it's gonna be there I know
the<00:01:24.479> biggest<00:01:24.659> thing<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.080> most<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> time

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the biggest thing is most of the time

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
the biggest thing is most of the time
people<00:01:26.670> land<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.229> fall<00:01:28.409> over

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
people land like this and then fall over

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
people land like this and then fall over
and<00:01:28.950> they're<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.460> balanced<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.570> there's<00:01:31.350> two

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and they're not balanced so there's two

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
and they're not balanced so there's two
things<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.189> number<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
things you can do for that number one is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
things you can do for that number one is
and<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> would<00:01:34.079> also<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.740> recommendation

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and this would also be a recommendation

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
and this would also be a recommendation
when<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.670> first<00:01:35.939> start<00:01:36.240> learning<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
when you first start learning it you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
when you first start learning it you
probably<00:01:37.680> point<00:01:38.070> your<00:01:38.189> feet<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.909> toes

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
probably point your feet or your toes

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
probably point your feet or your toes
down<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.659> catch<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
down and catch it like right here so to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
down and catch it like right here so to
avoid<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.159> hitting<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.939> key<00:01:45.390> grow<00:01:45.630> or

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
avoid like hitting your a key grow or

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.490 
avoid like hitting your a key grow or
like<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.860> ankle<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:49.189> okay<00:01:50.780> yeah<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.380> know

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
like your ankle or okay yeah so you know

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.770 
like your ankle or okay yeah so you know
do<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.829> once<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> get<00:01:53.310> used<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.640> I'd<00:01:53.909> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
do that once you get used to it I'd just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.859 
do that once you get used to it I'd just
kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> catch<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.500> life

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
kind of catch to life

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.139 
kind of catch to life
maybe<00:01:57.350> barely<00:01:57.740> hanging<00:01:58.009> off<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.490> mostly

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
maybe barely hanging off but mostly

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.710 
maybe barely hanging off but mostly
catch<00:01:59.420> design<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:01.610> change<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.450> if<00:02:02.600> that's

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
catch design so change to that if that's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.420 
catch design so change to that if that's
what<00:02:02.840> student<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.590> another<00:02:03.890> thing<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.250> you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
what student and another thing is you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.960 
what student and another thing is you
can<00:02:04.579> just<00:02:04.790> kick<00:02:05.659> back<00:02:05.689> test<00:02:06.409> for<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.340> that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
can just kick back test for it and that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.070 
can just kick back test for it and that
just<00:02:08.179> keeps<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.450> more<00:02:08.569> balanced<00:02:08.989> because

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
just keeps you more balanced because

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.740 
just keeps you more balanced because
instead<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> look<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:10.039> like<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> nobody<00:02:11.450> can

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
instead of look like like a nobody can

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.559 
instead of look like like a nobody can
touch<00:02:11.989> thing<00:02:12.260> like<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.280> just<00:02:13.510> spread<00:02:14.510> your

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
touch thing like you just spread your

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.160 
touch thing like you just spread your
legs

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
legs

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
legs
that's<00:02:15.650> also<00:02:15.830> what<00:02:16.040> I'd<00:02:16.160> recommend<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> fly

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
that's also what I'd recommend for a fly

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.050 
that's also what I'd recommend for a fly
out<00:02:17.390> because<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.500> not<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.950> necessity<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.910> get

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
out because it's not a necessity to get

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.050 
out because it's not a necessity to get
like<00:02:20.300> time<00:02:21.230> part<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.739> around<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:23.000> know

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
like time part of it around so you know

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
like time part of it around so you know
just<00:02:23.269> keeps<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.569> balanced<00:02:23.959> that's<00:02:24.769> kind<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
just keeps you balanced that's kind of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.470 
just keeps you balanced that's kind of
what'll<00:02:25.250> happen<00:02:25.400> naturally<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.940> stay

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
what'll happen naturally and stay

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.440 
what'll happen naturally and stay
balanced<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.069> biggest<00:02:28.340> thing<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:29.330> other

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
balanced is the biggest thing the other

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.680 
balanced is the biggest thing the other
thing<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:31.040> stay<00:02:31.310> balanced<00:02:31.760> especially<00:02:32.390> fly

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
thing so stay balanced especially fly

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.320 
thing so stay balanced especially fly
out<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.130> maybe<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.580> just<00:02:34.670> me<00:02:34.880> but<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.150> I'd

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
out like maybe it's just me but like I'd

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.940 
out like maybe it's just me but like I'd
always<00:02:35.480> go<00:02:35.720> up<00:02:35.750> try<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.110> heal<00:02:36.350> up<00:02:36.470> fly<00:02:36.680> out<00:02:36.709> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
always go up try to heal up fly out and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.759 
always go up try to heal up fly out and
I'm<00:02:37.069> just<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.819> die<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.260> don't<00:02:39.350> even<00:02:39.650> know

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
I'm just like die like I don't even know

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.800 
I'm just like die like I don't even know
what<00:02:39.920> would<00:02:40.040> happen<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.670> probably<00:02:41.540> throw<00:02:41.720> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
what would happen so probably throw it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.390 
what would happen so probably throw it
late<00:02:42.080> maybe<00:02:42.440> fly<00:02:42.799> out<00:02:42.950> if<00:02:43.069> that's<00:02:43.220> what's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
late maybe fly out if that's what's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:53.520 
late maybe fly out if that's what's
happening<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.209> just<00:02:44.720> get<00:02:45.200> up<00:02:45.700> then

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250 

that's<00:02:54.530> pretty<00:02:55.489> much<00:02:55.610> oh<00:02:55.940> I'll<00:02:56.810> show<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
that's pretty much oh I'll show you a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:21.770 
that's pretty much oh I'll show you a
few<00:02:57.560> examples<00:03:01.030> okay

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.060 

reasons<00:03:22.780> for<00:03:22.840> learning<00:03:23.080> these<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.650> usually

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
reasons for learning these I usually

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.350 
reasons for learning these I usually
think<00:03:24.160> they<00:03:24.310> aren't<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.580> stupid<00:03:25.060> like<00:03:25.210> why

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
think they aren't just stupid like why

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.380 
think they aren't just stupid like why
would<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.020> come<00:03:26.350> first<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.250> all

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
would you do it but come first of all

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.850 
would you do it but come first of all
they're<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.510> most<00:03:28.690> common<00:03:29.050> like<00:03:29.200> ball<00:03:29.710> thing

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
they're the most common like ball thing

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.500 
they're the most common like ball thing
you<00:03:29.950> can<00:03:30.070> do<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.280> like<00:03:30.430> people<00:03:31.180> doing<00:03:31.360> way<00:03:31.480> more

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
you can do it like people doing way more

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.820 
you can do it like people doing way more
than<00:03:31.870> frontside<00:03:32.290> threes<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:37.830> primary

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
than frontside threes and the primary

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.280 
than frontside threes and the primary
reason<00:03:38.890> is<00:03:39.250> rewinds<00:03:39.790> like<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.170> up

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
reason is rewinds like you know you up

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.730 
reason is rewinds like you know you up
tail<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:43.180> have<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.390> learn<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.620> he

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
tail it and you have to learn the he

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.790 
tail it and you have to learn the he
would<00:03:45.000> do<00:03:46.000> everyone<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:47.440> then<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> other

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
would do everyone so and then the other

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.380 
would do everyone so and then the other
thing<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.100> decades<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.850> them<00:03:48.970> backside

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
thing is decades if you do them backside

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.990 
thing is decades if you do them backside
you<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.720> like<00:03:49.870> learn<00:03:50.680> how<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:50.920> catch<00:03:51.160> up

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
you have to like learn how to catch up

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:10.200 
you have to like learn how to catch up
and<00:03:52.720> then<00:03:54.270> like<00:03:55.270> backside<00:03:55.870> feedback<00:04:08.730> here<00:04:09.730> and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
and then like backside feedback here and

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.380 
and then like backside feedback here and
then<00:04:10.450> they<00:04:10.570> try<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.110> jump<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:12.670> it

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
then they try to like jump in it like it

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.330 
then they try to like jump in it like it
might<00:04:13.600> not<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:13.900> obvious<00:04:14.380> I'm

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
might not be that obvious I'm

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.490 
might not be that obvious I'm
over-exaggerating<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:16.720> they<00:04:17.080> throw<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.380> out

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
over-exaggerating like they throw it out

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.950 
over-exaggerating like they throw it out
and<00:04:17.650> bring<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.920> back
