foot and what these grooves will help us

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.510 
foot and what these grooves will help us
do<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.760> when<00:00:40.270> we<00:00:40.480> are<00:00:40.750> installing<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:42.040> zipper

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
do is when we are installing the zipper

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.010 
do is when we are installing the zipper
it<00:00:43.270> is<00:00:43.510> going<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:44.080> open<00:00:44.380> up<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.370> coil<00:00:45.790> of<00:00:46.150> the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
it is going to open up the coil of the

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.040 
it is going to open up the coil of the
zipper<00:00:47.470> so<00:00:48.250> we're<00:00:48.460> able<00:00:48.700> to<00:00:48.910> stitch<00:00:49.480> real

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
zipper so we're able to stitch real

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.920 
zipper so we're able to stitch real
close<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.740> coil<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.700> because<00:00:52.690> we're

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
close to that coil and because we're

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.980 
close to that coil and because we're
able<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.320> do<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:54.760> how<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.540> is<00:00:55.750> made

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
able to do that this is how it is made

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.410 
able to do that this is how it is made
invisible<00:00:56.770> when<00:00:57.010> you<00:00:57.190> close<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.790> up<00:00:58.120> in<00:00:58.300> the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
invisible when you close it up in the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.620 
invisible when you close it up in the
seam<00:00:58.690> and<00:00:58.960> it<00:00:59.080> disappears<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:01.180> when<00:01:01.360> putting

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
seam and it disappears so when putting

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.350 
seam and it disappears so when putting
the<00:01:01.840> number<00:01:02.140> 35<00:01:02.740> foot<00:01:03.130> on<00:01:03.340> the<00:01:03.610> sewing<00:01:03.880> machine

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
the number 35 foot on the sewing machine

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380 
the number 35 foot on the sewing machine
you<00:01:04.900> will<00:01:05.050> notice<00:01:05.410> there<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.800> no<00:01:05.830> slot<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:07.360> the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
you will notice there is no slot for the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.170 
you will notice there is no slot for the
thread<00:01:07.900> to<00:01:08.440> go<00:01:08.620> into<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.220> go<00:01:09.370> under<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.910> foot

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
thread to go into to go under the foot

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.630 
thread to go into to go under the foot
so<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:11.020> little<00:01:11.470> trick<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.800> get<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.340> thread

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
so a little trick to get the thread

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.780 
so a little trick to get the thread
under<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.090> foot<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:14.410> just<00:01:14.680> simply<00:01:15.190> put<00:01:15.610> the
