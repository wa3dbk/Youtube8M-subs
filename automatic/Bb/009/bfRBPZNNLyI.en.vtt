00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.379
 you want to take a trip to a factory 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.440
 of ice cream and see how it makes a good 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.660
 condis ice cream ice cream is one of the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.939
 few products we think is the only 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
 that is consumed frozen one of his 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.990
 main components of milk and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.240
 this is what we first receive in the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.640
 factories the raw materials of materials 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.640
 Basic premiums of ice cream in general 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.150
 and especially this one of condis is milk 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.879
 cream sugars and then the ingredients 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.180
 flavorings like dulce de leche and 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.440
 cocoa if they are chocolate etc all 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.190
 these ingredients arrive different 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.580
 forms some are in powder some are 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.670
 liquids 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.250
 we mix all this in some boilers 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.690
 where it is heated and where it is processed in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 a process called pasteurization 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.040
 once is a pastoriza dow the product 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.960
 it has to be cooled, that is, it is what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.400
 at home we store the milk in the fridge 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.989
 for exactly the same as the only thing 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.869
 our refrigerators are huge are about 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.420
 tanks 4 tons where it is held 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.220
 everything in the cold product is 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.929
 ripening begins to make the process 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 crystallizing ice cream is 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.590
 call 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.260
 this crystallization what you get is 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.240
 that the fat that the cream has starts to 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.490
 solidify and this is a process 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.920
 quite important for the quality of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.229
 ice cream we went to do the first 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.909
 freezing phase of the ice cream this 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.979
 first phase of ice cream freezing 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.900
 it is days of freezers 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.810
 continuous an example is this this is a 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 very tiny of a plant a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.590
 pilot plant of our plant 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.259
 tests in the factory we have huge 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.780
 then in this continuous freezer what 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.550
 What is done is to form ice in a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.229
 first phase but at the same time 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.869
 does another operation and that incorporate 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.539
 amounts of air and this is what you 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.670
 gives ice cream creaminess we take advantage of 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.550
 when it comes out of this continuous freezer 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.810
 it is a pasty mass that is to say moldable 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.060
 to fill containers to make poles 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.490
 chocolates any kind of way since 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.440
 then we put it in some cameras 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.179
 of freezing specially prepared 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.759
 that work and operate at very high temperatures 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.819
 low freezing to freeze 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.159
 finally the entire product 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.319
 an ice cream is to buy a piece of 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.960
 happiness and you give a child a 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.020
 ice cream and always smile 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.020
