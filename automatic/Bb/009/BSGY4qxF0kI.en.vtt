00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.860 

our<00:00:11.400> goal<00:00:11.700> was<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> really<00:00:12.300> create<00:00:12.510> an<00:00:12.690> engine

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
our goal was to really create an engine

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.650 
our goal was to really create an engine
of<00:00:13.080> scale<00:00:13.320> both<00:00:14.210> co-creating<00:00:15.210> like<00:00:15.330> movie

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
of scale both co-creating like movie

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.740 
of scale both co-creating like movie
great<00:00:16.340> rendering<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.119> did<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.450> by

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
great rendering so so we did that by

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450 
great rendering so so we did that by
creating<00:00:19.440> a<00:00:19.619> renderer<00:00:19.920> which<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> called<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
creating a renderer which is called a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.060 
creating a renderer which is called a
deferred<00:00:20.820> renderer<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.960> an<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.470> special

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
deferred renderer which is an a special

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
deferred renderer which is an a special
type<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.550> engine<00:00:23.790> but<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.420> cool<00:00:24.570> thing<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
type of engine but the cool thing is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.330 
type of engine but the cool thing is
that<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.110> Choga<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:25.770> good<00:00:25.950> lighting

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that the Choga is really good lighting

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.130 
that the Choga is really good lighting
effects<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.360> good<00:00:27.510> special<00:00:27.870> effects

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
effects and really good special effects

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
effects and really good special effects
which<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:28.860> all<00:00:28.980> polite<00:00:29.280> and<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:29.640> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
which are all polite and kind of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.240 
which are all polite and kind of
fullscreen<00:00:30.240> fashion<00:00:30.930> like<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.530> full

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
fullscreen fashion like we have full

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.490 
fullscreen fashion like we have full
screen<00:00:32.489> motion<00:00:32.850> blur<00:00:33.030> we've<00:00:33.600> got<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.140> depth<00:00:34.379> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
screen motion blur we've got a depth of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
screen motion blur we've got a depth of
field<00:00:34.739> we've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.190> anti-aliasing<00:00:36.000> we're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
field we've got anti-aliasing we're

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.650 
field we've got anti-aliasing we're
running<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> full<00:00:37.050> 720p<00:00:37.470> image<00:00:38.340> no<00:00:39.150> shortcuts

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
running a full 720p image no shortcuts

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.740 
running a full 720p image no shortcuts
there<00:00:39.900> and<00:00:40.830> we<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.520> chose<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.449> know<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> think

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
there and we just chose you know I think

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.259 
there and we just chose you know I think
we<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.379> realizing<00:00:44.220> that<00:00:44.309> kind<00:00:44.580> of<00:00:44.640> movie

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
we really realizing that kind of movie

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.910 
we really realizing that kind of movie
quality<00:00:45.510> image

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320 

basically<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.130> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.490> mosaic<00:00:54.090> which

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
basically this is the mosaic which

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330 
basically this is the mosaic which
social<00:00:54.540> all<00:00:55.440> kinds<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> different<00:00:55.920> buffers

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
social all kinds of different buffers

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.060 
social all kinds of different buffers
that<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.880> use<00:00:57.060> to<00:00:57.300> composite<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.740> screen

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that we use to composite the the screen

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.320 
that we use to composite the the screen
together<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.490> SPU<00:01:00.590> friends<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.740> start<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
together on SPU friends we start with a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930 
together on SPU friends we start with a
Z<00:01:03.330> buffer<00:01:03.510> where<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> where<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
Z buffer where the where the the the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.670 
Z buffer where the where the the the
black<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.360> front<00:01:06.600> widest<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.440> in<00:01:07.620> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
black is in front widest in the in the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.430 
black is in front widest in the in the
back<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:08.910> the<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.870> per<00:01:10.200> pixel

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
back this is the the the per pixel

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.880 
back this is the the the per pixel
normal<00:01:10.980> detail<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.390> lighting<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
normal detail is for lighting this is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.790 
normal detail is for lighting this is
the<00:01:14.070> specular<00:01:14.760> specular<00:01:15.660> reflectivity<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
the specular specular reflectivity and

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.240 
the specular specular reflectivity and
intensity<00:01:17.790> where<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.530> red<00:01:19.680> areas<00:01:20.070> are

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
intensity where the the red areas are

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.830 
intensity where the the red areas are
more<00:01:20.370> shiny<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> green<00:01:21.360> areas<00:01:21.660> from

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
more shiny in the green areas from

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.350 
more shiny in the green areas from
starless<00:01:22.320> shiny<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:25.340> color

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
starless shiny then we have the color

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
starless shiny then we have the color
let's<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.510> just<00:01:27.660> purely<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> color

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
let's see just purely the the color

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.250 
let's see just purely the the color
comes<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.400> textures<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.110> we

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
comes out of textures and when we

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.370 
comes out of textures and when we
composite<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.220> whole<00:01:32.460> screen<00:01:32.850> together<00:01:33.570> we

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
composite the whole screen together we

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.130 
composite the whole screen together we
get<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.950> almost<00:01:35.580> final<00:01:35.970> result<00:01:36.330> which<00:01:36.660> which

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
get the almost final result which which

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.650 
get the almost final result which which
shows<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.310> lighting<00:01:38.700> applied<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.479> then

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
shows the the lighting applied and then

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.810 
shows the the lighting applied and then
finally<00:01:40.260> we<00:01:40.560> add<00:01:40.800> on<00:01:41.190> top<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.580> we<00:01:41.790> add

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
finally we add on top of that we add

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.920 
finally we add on top of that we add
motion<00:01:42.240> blur<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.080> add<00:01:44.690> anti-icing<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
motion blur and we add anti-icing and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.390 
motion blur and we add anti-icing and
also<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.350> particles<00:01:46.710> kicked<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
also some particles kicked in there and

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:56.719 
also some particles kicked in there and
that<00:01:48.090> makes<00:01:48.300> up<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.900> final<00:01:49.290> image

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 

the<00:01:57.450> lighting<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:57.900> of<00:01:58.110> our<00:01:58.229> focal<00:01:58.590> points

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the lighting is one of our focal points

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.320 
the lighting is one of our focal points
of<00:01:58.950> our<00:01:59.280> engine<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.790> so<00:01:59.970> what<00:02:00.119> he<00:02:00.240> basically

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
of our engine so so what he basically

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.899 
of our engine so so what he basically
did<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> deferred<00:02:02.460> rendering

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
did there is with the deferred rendering

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.280 
did there is with the deferred rendering
all<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.270> lighting<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> supposed

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
all the lighting is on the supposed

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
all the lighting is on the supposed
process<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.920> top<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.280> screen<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
process on top of the screen so

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.880 
process on top of the screen so
basically<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.140> have<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> limit<00:02:07.590> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
basically we we don't have a limit on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
basically we we don't have a limit on
how<00:02:08.039> many<00:02:08.099> lights<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.849> certain<00:02:09.060> objects<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
how many lights and certain objects can

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.479 
how many lights and certain objects can
touch<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:10.020> how<00:02:10.110> many<00:02:10.380> lights<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
touch or how many lights we have on the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.370 
touch or how many lights we have on the
screen<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.180> basically<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.080> scenes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
screen so basically there are scenes

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.870 
screen so basically there are scenes
which<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.040> show<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.250> where<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:14.760> have

two other Tree on the lights just active

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.290 
two other Tree on the lights just active
in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> view<00:02:17.250> cone<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.700> you're<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.090> looking

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in the view cone so you're just looking

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.940 
in the view cone so you're just looking
at<00:02:18.569> three<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> flights<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.470> although<00:02:19.620> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
at three on the flights and although we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
at three on the flights and although we
even<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.250> things<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> Helghast<00:02:22.050> you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
even do things like the the Helghast you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.479 
even do things like the the Helghast you
know<00:02:22.319> with<00:02:22.440> our<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.739> our<00:02:22.769> with<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.190> red<00:02:23.459> eye

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
know with our with our with a red eye

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.910 
know with our with our with a red eye
still<00:02:23.970> those<00:02:24.180> red<00:02:24.420> eyes<00:02:24.569> are<00:02:24.810> actual<00:02:25.440> light<00:02:25.650> so

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
still those red eyes are actual light so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.070 
still those red eyes are actual light so
if<00:02:26.040> they<00:02:26.190> shoot<00:02:26.250> over<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:27.330> they're<00:02:27.630> gone<00:02:27.840> or

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
if they shoot over there they're gone or

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.410 
if they shoot over there they're gone or

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
if to walk next to a wall actually see

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.479 
if to walk next to a wall actually see
the<00:02:30.540> wall<00:02:30.750> light<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.260> correctly<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.160> that's

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
the wall light up correctly and that's

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.640 
the wall light up correctly and that's
not<00:02:32.640> it's<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.600> heck<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.140> how

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
not it's not just the heck it's just how

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.000 
not it's not just the heck it's just how
intricate<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.819> how<00:02:36.000> complete<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.049> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
intricate and how complete the the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.440 
intricate and how complete the the
rendering<00:02:38.400> solution<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.060> death<00:02:39.269> of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
rendering solution is to death of

rendering solution is to death of
children

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.040 

we<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:47.940> ragdolls<00:02:48.330> like<00:02:48.510> everybody<00:02:48.870> else

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
we have ragdolls like everybody else

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.690 
we have ragdolls like everybody else
does<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.070> but<00:02:50.190> we<00:02:50.370> wanted<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
does right but but but we wanted to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.640 
does right but but but we wanted to
really<00:02:50.880> focus<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> hit<00:02:51.660> reactions<00:02:52.500> of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
really focus on the hit reactions of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680 
really focus on the hit reactions of
guys<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.370> basically<00:02:53.520> now<00:02:54.150> every<00:02:54.480> bullet

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
guys so basically now every bullet

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.780 
guys so basically now every bullet
should<00:02:54.930> make<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> dramatic<00:02:55.980> impact<00:02:56.100> what<00:02:56.670> we

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
should make a dramatic impact what we

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
should make a dramatic impact what we
actually<00:02:56.910> do<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.360> instead<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.020> using<00:02:58.290> rag

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
actually do is instead of just using rag

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
actually do is instead of just using rag
dolls<00:02:58.830> for<00:02:58.980> dead<00:02:59.190> bodies<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.970> also<00:03:00.090> use<00:03:00.330> them

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
dolls for dead bodies we also use them

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.780 
dolls for dead bodies we also use them
for<00:03:00.510> live<00:03:00.900> bodies<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:01.860> overlay<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.550> top<00:03:02.670> of

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
for live bodies so we overlay on top of

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.010 
for live bodies so we overlay on top of
all<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.000> animations<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.630> characters

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
all the animations of the characters

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.590 
all the animations of the characters
playing<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.740> overlay<00:03:05.160> real<00:03:05.880> time<00:03:06.120> rag<00:03:06.360> dolls

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
playing we overlay real time rag dolls

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.060 
playing we overlay real time rag dolls
to<00:03:07.020> shoot<00:03:07.230> them<00:03:07.350> in<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> left<00:03:07.680> shoulder<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
to shoot them in the left shoulder you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
to shoot them in the left shoulder you
see<00:03:08.160> their<00:03:08.430> left<00:03:08.640> shoulder<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:09.420> backwards<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
see their left shoulder go backwards and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.650 
see their left shoulder go backwards and
all<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> we<00:03:10.830> actually<00:03:11.070> apply<00:03:11.820> multiple

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
all of that we actually apply multiple

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.110 
all of that we actually apply multiple
layers<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.960> real-time<00:03:13.890> inverse<00:03:14.550> kinematics

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
layers of real-time inverse kinematics

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.270 
layers of real-time inverse kinematics
to<00:03:15.300> reposition<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.050> legs<00:03:16.290> correctly<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.160> we

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
to reposition the legs correctly and we

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.380 
to reposition the legs correctly and we
position<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> hands<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.180> they're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
position the hands so that they're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.780 
position the hands so that they're
correctly<00:03:18.900> crapping<00:03:19.260> grabbing<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> guns<00:03:20.190> etc

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
correctly crapping grabbing the guns etc

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240 
correctly crapping grabbing the guns etc
it's<00:03:21.120> very<00:03:21.210> competitive<00:03:21.750> genre<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.920> people

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
it's very competitive genre and people

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.680 
it's very competitive genre and people
are<00:03:23.310> constantly<00:03:23.430> pushing<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.210> think<00:03:24.570> we

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
are constantly pushing it I think we

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.480 
are constantly pushing it I think we
have<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.870> unique<00:03:25.140> opportunity<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.830> placing
