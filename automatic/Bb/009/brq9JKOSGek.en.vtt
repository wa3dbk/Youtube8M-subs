00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.710
 pensioner 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.749
 that should actually get my movie into a percent 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.060
 but all somehow set 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.919
 Did you know about it? 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.980
 well 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.789
 Dorsten answers back is the barber 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.410
 and on 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.930
 there is now Ahmar a small video of me percent self-commented 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.740
 which is the content Double which because of keeping my favorite classes 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.580
 do not go out of my class 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.080
 I like games 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.839
 and store to stop there 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:48.930
 gameplay 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.370
 the first class 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 the Irish Sea 11 Rahden second class with the LZ monks 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.420
 even around today 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.860
 mat percent in Suhl usually he uses Marcio goers had few 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.260
 People asked if I was never 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.480
 the action-game can omit 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 and yes I did stop but in Sniper 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.960
 I'm actually always the first people percent goal 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.390
 I just voted important as mine at the Black Ops March so Geithner 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.720
 Nahles can then age 2 50 Bio or Jungle 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 around 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.960
 that you just saw the little heirs of July 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.180
 and as a second powerplay not always 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.760
 Percent hard per game though Mayer 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.100
 be sure to stop the long breath worrying about creating faster weapons 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.070
 switch 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.550
 and percent 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.530
 Clear goes in Black Ops maybe was as well as war short-time work has it easy 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.370
 not often that I do not like that 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.090
 and the DAX does not share in Steindorf the Altana I always as the beginning 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.170
 the EM with Art 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.580
 and around 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.840
 - the garden 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.360
 practical and 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 Percent against a dumpling rain 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.770
 then I have the rest of the rest he shares far more than Claymore shares 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.729
 Percent 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.239
 Channel based on grenade 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.760
 and percent 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.809
 the normal Frerk 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.179
 or later again partly 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.249
 I am just 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:24.299
 second class actually in quite a few markets for example pictures 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.049
 Kleinenbremen crooked 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.369
 I'm here to serve Carré 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.599
 Relocation of Lounge 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.620
 in Athens 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.299
 if I'm sick of it 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.930
 and there and I have mastered Swype Life and Blackbird and here 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.889
 Jürgen Schopper Werner has come along 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.249
 the rocker percent 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.709
 OK 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.019
 But most of the time I still have the ZK and that at Bremen and 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.839
 I actually like Marie Beatles Joe Cocker better and sometimes 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.259
 In general, the light guides are always there 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.689
 if opponents 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.399
 not so great 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.689
 vaihingen 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.439
 for "good 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.729
 So I really play really good players with an aka percent 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.389
 goes by example is 15 clock the whole time somewhere in the clique 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.809
 fight and 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.809
 Percent wait until my work the rain shower 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.370
 where he sneaked then everything on Klose enigmatic place 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.959
 So you have Ideas of the Titans in the country 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.339
 and Dr 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.379
 that's why 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.209
 no more and no longer take the procedure as the product 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:42.529
 that's with symbian ^ 3 by Dave King the halfway 90 than mine's service weapon 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.799
 must be at the top of the list 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.499
 the others are not bad, but Alexa nearly 1 fell 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.460
 adjustable 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.789
 or best 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.369
 and that's why I play 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.819
 Percent performance with Dr 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.229
 I brought a lot of money and gold 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.759
 there will surely be both the door again with percent gold 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.489
 and around 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.199
 the next video what comes next is the ISPA Maß class I think 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.819
 That's where I lay down 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.389
 Gameplay up 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.779
 Wolf can look like that 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.430
 the games I called my means are the animals 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.689
 3 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.819
 pick up 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.250
 The video game I want to clarify with a corner you can see that I totally 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.159
 Percent he ends up somewhere hundreds 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:35.300
 but they usually sprout up enormously as standard-empty ones 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.860
 who out 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.930
 if now a little bit Schawaller finally got stuck 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.400
 The opponents are really good 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.159
 in the end, TS um 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.159
 I believe 38 Vienna's ex 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.440
 This number was called KEK I invite Felix Heydemann Schabacker but made times 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.590
 I call 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.449
 Rheine in 38 6% Midnight Olic l will 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.319
 @ bit difficult 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.479
 otherwise 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.969
 Immediately follow videos with Max percent commented 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.659
 The RMA is said to be about your classes in to post IT 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.979
 Classes Post is the market leader 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.759
 from points 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.580
 and 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.520
 the 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.260
 Vitus also follow 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.610
 then i just read 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.830
 Max a bi-tool of these annen the topics 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.719
 on your knees 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.150
 In addition, after the PRD's new PSP is a banality Dr 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.469
 around 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.709
 You had 7 presented I will probably buy me 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:45.499
 but I think the test as well as the 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.529
 the SP will 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.050
 Although quite nice cool graphics remained compared to the DS 3 or DS earlier 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:59.659
 will again surpass the chart by outnumbering Nintendo 3ds percent 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.110
 but in general 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.680
 l'innovation is close to it 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.389
 Graphic Regis I am, for example, there are majorities 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.240
 relatively no matter when I hear mostly the spouses 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.120
 Angel Black Ops by the vagina graphics in Diepholz much better I every game 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.219
 an opponent graphic but 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.219
 if not fun good multiplayer then has 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.800
 "I play it, I do it 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.110
 otherwise it was true of course you can remember thus 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.520
 graphic 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.810
 Graphic bells and you have the fear I'll buy the thing then 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.960
 then probably no more detail and then go 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.919
 but the animals wake up around 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.849
 because boxing will definitely make a difference 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.849
 says Gary Nintendo 3ds is already ordered 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.830
 yes, I'm texting on NewCo months at some point a Vizio times 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.729
 percent 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.889
 and Santi step but the new one 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.889
 the new energy black and white house 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.860
 I had already pre-ordered these 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.169
 ironically 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.040
 This may never have been planned with 3ds support 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:07.520
 because the old one 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.399
 the 3ds is coming 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.889
 I think 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.629
 at 25 mm 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.199
 14 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.139
 so 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.210
 or 25 of the Britons 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.300
 next version may be improved 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.749
 around and 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:28.249
 these are structures going to league but there are other cool stuff 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:29.849
 and 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.849
 I will definitely introduce you to them 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:35.529
 it should go cold death to an end 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:36.979
 they are watching 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:38.759
 Armenians 38 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.119
 8 90 $ / st at 30 6 so called 

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.629
 I never have 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.819
 I never did 

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:47.809
 then press now
