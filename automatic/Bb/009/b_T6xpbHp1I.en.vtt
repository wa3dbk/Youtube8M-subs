00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.810 

alright<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:42.619> try<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.820> tsunami

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
alright that's one let's try a tsunami

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.010 
alright that's one let's try a tsunami
then<00:01:45.240> let<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.990> sit<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:51.020> let's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
then let me just sit right here let's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.249 
then let me just sit right here let's
see<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.320> happens<00:01:57.200> pretty<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.860> wall<00:01:59.700> of

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
see what happens pretty much a wall of

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.960 
see what happens pretty much a wall of
water<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.740> spread<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:04.610> wish<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.759> just

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
water to spread that I wish would just

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.880 
water to spread that I wish would just
roll<00:02:06.179> in<00:02:06.420> fast<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.729> yeah<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:10.530> might<00:02:10.679> work

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
roll in fast but yeah it might work

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.840 
roll in fast but yeah it might work
alright<00:02:12.769> so<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:13.890> village<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> getting

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
alright so this village is getting

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:23.920 
alright so this village is getting
severely<00:02:15.690> trashed<00:02:17.180> let's<00:02:18.500> try<00:02:20.330> earthquake

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.950 

that's<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.650> hurts

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.440 

alright<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.140> i<00:02:34.170> think<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.450> life

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
alright so i think it just kind of life

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.870 
alright so i think it just kind of life
actually<00:02:37.040> damaged<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.160> building<00:02:38.580> maybe<00:02:38.700> i<00:02:38.820> need

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
actually damaged a building maybe i need

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.370 
actually damaged a building maybe i need
to<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> ground<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> earthquake

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
to be on the ground for the earthquake

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.890 
to be on the ground for the earthquake
let<00:02:40.620> me<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.830> give<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> go<00:02:41.340> i<00:02:41.780> don't<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.840> if

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
let me just give it a go i don't know if

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.230 
let me just give it a go i don't know if
you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.140> actually<00:02:43.290> summon<00:02:43.830> more<00:02:43.980> than<00:02:44.160> one

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.190 

whoa<00:02:48.240> whoa<00:02:50.210> there<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.390> go<00:02:51.570> that's<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
whoa whoa there you go that's the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.800 
whoa whoa there you go that's the
earthquake<00:02:53.300> pretty<00:02:54.300> impressive<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.660> there

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
earthquake pretty impressive so there

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.120 
earthquake pretty impressive so there
were<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> couple<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.440> ones<00:02:58.740> there's<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
were a couple of other ones there's a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.660 
were a couple of other ones there's a
vortex<00:02:59.940> which<00:03:00.360> i<00:03:00.540> think<00:03:01.280> let's<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.550> what

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
vortex which i think let's see what

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.670 
vortex which i think let's see what
happens<00:03:03.000> with<00:03:03.150> vortex<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> that's<00:03:10.230> kind<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
happens with vortex so that's kind of a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.630 
happens with vortex so that's kind of a
in<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.800> tornado<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> water<00:03:15.390> basically<00:03:16.640> so

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
in a tornado of water basically so

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.750 
in a tornado of water basically so
unfortunately<00:03:17.910> I've<00:03:18.570> made<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> mess<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.140> this

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
unfortunately I've made a mess of this

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.080 
unfortunately I've made a mess of this
village<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.330> volcanoes<00:03:22.100> are<00:03:23.100> spreading<00:03:23.880> over
