00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
was pretty interesting actually I've

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.300 
was pretty interesting actually I've
figured<00:02:51.329> out<00:02:51.569> after<00:02:52.350> my<00:02:52.440> last<00:02:52.590> meal<00:02:52.829> wasn't

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.059 
figured out after my last meal wasn't
very<00:02:53.700> hungry<00:02:53.940> actually<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.079> probably<00:02:55.440> ate<00:02:55.739> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
very hungry actually and probably ate a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.120 
very hungry actually and probably ate a
bit<00:02:56.850> too<00:02:57.030> much<00:02:57.269> i'm<00:02:57.569> super<00:02:58.200> full<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.620> and

bit too much i'm super full now and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.020 
bit too much i'm super full now and
obviously<00:02:59.819> my<00:03:00.889> stomach<00:03:01.889> capacities<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.489> little

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
obviously my stomach capacities a little

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.750 
obviously my stomach capacities a little
bit<00:03:03.209> smaller<00:03:03.540> than<00:03:03.840> my<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.069> looked<00:03:05.459> look

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
bit smaller than my what I looked look

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.280 
bit smaller than my what I looked look
what<00:03:06.030> i<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.299> looking<00:03:06.329> at<00:03:06.630> aren't<00:03:07.019> even<00:03:07.230> know

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
what i was looking at aren't even know

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.099 
what i was looking at aren't even know
that<00:03:07.440> makes<00:03:07.650> sense<00:03:08.060> anyway<00:03:09.060> um<00:03:09.329> today<00:03:09.959> was

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
that makes sense anyway um today was

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.569 
that makes sense anyway um today was
pretty<00:03:10.260> interesting<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:11.099> because<00:03:11.549> I

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
pretty interesting like because I

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.120 
pretty interesting like because I

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
starch solution so that's like probably

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.860 
starch solution so that's like probably
the<00:06:00.640> most<00:06:00.820> friend<00:06:01.060> of<00:06:01.150> hidden<00:06:01.330> in<00:06:01.450> like<00:06:01.630> nine

the<00:07:45.550> difference<00:07:46.050> but<00:07:47.050> it<00:07:47.080> sort<00:07:47.560> of<00:07:47.620> makes<00:07:47.740> me

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:47.920 
the difference but it sort of makes me

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.340 
the difference but it sort of makes me
worried<00:07:48.130> that<00:07:48.460> you<00:07:49.090> know<00:07:49.120> eating<00:07:49.660> a<00:07:49.840> higher

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:52.660 
volume of fruit during the day makes you

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.850 
volume of fruit during the day makes you
super<00:07:53.229> hungry<00:07:53.410> at<00:07:53.650> night
