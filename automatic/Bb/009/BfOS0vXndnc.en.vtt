00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you are and how does athletics become an

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
you are and how does athletics become an
integral<00:00:34.350> part<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> whole<00:00:35.040> institution<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
integral part of the whole institution I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.510 
integral part of the whole institution I
had<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> advantage<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.309> previous

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
had the advantage in one of my previous

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.090 
had the advantage in one of my previous
works<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> high<00:00:39.300> school<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.559> both<00:00:40.920> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
works in high school to be both an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.650 
works in high school to be both an
assistant<00:00:41.579> principal<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.210> athletic

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
assistant principal and an athletic

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900 
assistant principal and an athletic
director<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:44.129> began<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.520> see

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
director and so I really began to see

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.690 
director and so I really began to see
how<00:00:45.320> those<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.829> least<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> level

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
how those two at least on that level

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.479 
how those two at least on that level
could<00:00:47.850> dovetail<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> really

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
could dovetail and so this is really

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
could dovetail and so this is really
exciting<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> come<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> collegiate

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
exciting now to come to a collegiate

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
exciting now to come to a collegiate
level<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> get<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:55.079> thing<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
level and get into that same thing of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.119 
level and get into that same thing of
how<00:00:55.949> does<00:00:56.600> athletics<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.809> academics<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
how does athletics and academics and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.630 
how does athletics and academics and
student<00:00:59.460> life<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.850> fit<00:01:00.180> together<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.640> how

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
student life all fit together and how

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.750 
student life all fit together and how
critical<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.769> use<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> athletic

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
critical it is that we use the athletic

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
critical it is that we use the athletic
experience<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:07.500> shape<00:01:08.030> who<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
experience to shape who they are and it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.240 
experience to shape who they are and it
becomes<00:01:10.260> even<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.590> critical<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
becomes even more critical at this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.490 
becomes even more critical at this
collegiate<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:11.970> where<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.840> estimation

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
collegiate level where in my estimation

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.740 
collegiate level where in my estimation
you're<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.360> developing<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.509> life

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you're really developing your life

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.730 
you're really developing your life
values<00:01:16.790> you're<00:01:17.790> you're<00:01:18.720> recognizing<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
values you're you're recognizing that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.060 
values you're you're recognizing that
the<00:01:19.920> end<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.430> sight<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.540> therefore<00:01:22.070> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the end is in sight and so therefore you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
the end is in sight and so therefore you
have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.640> begin<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.119> understand<00:01:24.689> okay

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
