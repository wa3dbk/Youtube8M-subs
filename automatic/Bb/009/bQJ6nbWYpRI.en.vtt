00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.080
 I bring today I bring you a package of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.530
 very special textures for me and now 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.440
 will see why 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:36.020
 and I say very special to me because it is 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:39.140
 only and exclusively for me 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.600
 Here I show you, it's worth in this package 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.880
 textures has done us that has not been 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.120
 made one for me customized for me 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.829
 and another to be and well, I think 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.140
 that is super cool 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.329
 this would be the wooden sword this 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.429
 it would be the golden sword with his name 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:03.210
 there is the stone sword itself 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.210
 iron sword 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.299
 and the diamond sword 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 Y 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 here we see also good we do not see it 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.230
 because it does not bring composed now me the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.230
 I will put 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.300
 caught a mushroom inadvertently 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 worth the diamond armor does not have 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.320
 nothing special is an armor of 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.920
 normal diamond as you can 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.490
 see front and back 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.159
 ahead nothing special here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.479
 we have my bow 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.479
 what is super cute 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.100
 As you can see, it has the tension indicator 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.370
 and the particles 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.680
 of critical there is 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.220
 and it starts to rain this is not an evil and 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.700
 I will be so I will take it 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.670
 here we have line the pen that as you see 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.000
 it is as well as moradita rosita with shades 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 purple pink supercookies super monkey 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.060
 super cute golden apple and apple 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.630
 delighted we will see the particles 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.430
 that in this case I do not know if you see 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.450
 as well as some waves 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.209
 and this is the same 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.030
 As you can see, the waves are changing 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.030
 color as it goes down 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.430
 its intensity 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 and well I think it's super cute what 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.340
 done that with our packages of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.080
 textures we are super delighted the tnt 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 super delighted both seve and me with 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.950
 they're going to put this on 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.950
 show you the fire 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.620
 Y 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.440
 that would be the fire 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.130
 and here we will see the effect of burning the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.170
 effect when burning so it seems to me that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.530
 what good for pvp is quite annoying 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.380
 because it takes enough screen this is the 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.380
 effect of droplets as you see 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.420
 I think that the effect of fire maybe 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.300
 I should not take so much screen in a 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.450
 textures package visibility over 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.970
 all of the pvp is very important 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.040
 and good and another little thing that we do 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.580
 who has done it to us in this way 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.580
 because what we use the most for is 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.930
 for the survival it is worth but good that 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.480
 I guess I would not have any problem 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.510
 in saying it is like putting the inventory 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.680
 transparent for parapipi and as you see 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.610
 You have put my eyes here 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.840
 lookers in my name and the m has things 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.870
 very curious 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.890
 I'm going to show you some curiosity that 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.110
 I think I had 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.550
 I think I remember 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.470
 how can this be 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.470
 You see the would indicate my eyes 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.879
 here 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.700
 in the oven not in the other package 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.060
 textures and he had like a goblin in 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.979
 the oven super cute but in this no and already 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.660
 is here and I show you some of the 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.970
 most important envelopes that you are going to 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.940
 find them at the time of the pvp that is 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.389
 normal honors is the 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.009
 texture of facebook and we are left with 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.569
 see the potions 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.710
 what do you see 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:43.450
 then to the in their respective 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.520
 particles and changing position 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.310
 the reason of the color it has comes out the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.410
 color of the particles little more than 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.270
 tell you about this texture to give you the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.120
 thank you here for the wonderful ones 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.760
 textile pack that makes us wear 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.520
 making us already are a few 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.710
 I think there are three or four versions of 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.350
 minecraft that takes us 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.210
 personalizing and many thanks for 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.729
 the job 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.100
 and well, a little more to say, I'm going to 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.960
 show you the wool 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.320
 but let's the one who knows facebook and 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.860
 know the wool how are those would be the 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.750
 wool 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.969
 and it is already change nothing more simply 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.769
 well, that 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.899
 has customized what are the 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:28.699
 tools for us I already tell you I know 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.219
 that has yours exactly the same 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.669
 I think deseret changes the color of the 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:37.519
 arch and the color of the under but the 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.599
 share is as well as more reddish and the arc 

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.429
 I think it also changes the color 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.339
 I remember very well but we are going everything 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:44.869
 is exactly the same and I hope that 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:48.559
 you liked this is my pack of 

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:51.249
