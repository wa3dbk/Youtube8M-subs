00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.049 
know who made it know whose design this
is<00:00:30.349> based<00:00:30.590> on<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.369> spider-man<00:00:31.759> right

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
is based on so that spider-man right

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:32.920 
is based on so that spider-man right
there<00:00:32.300> I<00:00:32.329> think<00:00:32.450> it's<00:00:32.689> like<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
there I think it's like the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.660 
there I think it's like the
wall-crawling<00:00:33.590> spider-man<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.460> the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.780 
I do I drop him he is pretty skinny but
I<00:00:59.750> think<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.260> suits<00:01:00.560> him<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:01.070> is<00:01:01.310> more<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.610> a

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
I think it suits him it is more of a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.240 
I think it suits him it is more of a
traditional<00:01:02.420> look<00:01:02.450> in<00:01:03.020> terms<00:01:03.530> of<00:01:03.829> its<00:01:04.009> based

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
traditional look in terms of its based

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.670 
traditional look in terms of its based
on<00:01:04.460> that<00:01:04.699> whoever<00:01:05.299> made<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.990> art<00:01:06.290> design

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
on that whoever made it that art design

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.590 
on that whoever made it that art design
and<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:06.979> think<00:01:07.189> it<00:01:07.310> looks<00:01:07.520> just<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.329> so<00:01:08.570> I

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
and I think it looks just like that so I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.270 
and I think it looks just like that so I
don't<00:01:08.990> mind<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.320> skinniness<00:01:09.619> some<00:01:10.040> people

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
don't mind the skinniness some people

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.160 
don't mind the skinniness some people
don't<00:01:10.460> prefer<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.180> they<00:01:11.299> go<00:01:11.479> with<00:01:11.630> snapshot

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
don't prefer it so they go with snapshot

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.389 
don't prefer it so they go with snapshot
or<00:01:12.520> sinister<00:01:13.520> six<00:01:14.320> but<00:01:15.320> this<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.950> one<00:01:16.130> that

quarter inches tall there is this black
version<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.159> we<00:01:31.249> got<00:01:31.399> later<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:33.439> paint

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
version that we got later on the paint

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.800 
version that we got later on the paint
work<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.189> not<00:01:34.399> quite<00:01:34.789> as<00:01:35.060> sharp<00:01:35.389> but<00:01:35.689> then

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
work is not quite as sharp but then

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.209 
work is not quite as sharp but then
again<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.649> that<00:01:36.770> time<00:01:36.979> period

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
again that this is in that time period

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.529 
again that this is in that time period
where<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.520> paint's<00:01:37.759> were<00:01:37.850> all<00:01:37.969> kind<00:01:38.209> of<00:01:38.359> off

where the paint's were all kind of off

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.690 
where the paint's were all kind of off
so<00:01:39.319> it's<00:01:39.530> okay<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:39.979> one<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> black

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
so that's that's something to note but

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.429 
so that's that's something to note but
same<00:02:04.849> exact<00:02:05.179> figure<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:05.479> black<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:05.899> red<00:02:06.200> so

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
same exact figure but black and red so

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.770 
same exact figure but black and red so
we'll<00:02:06.560> set<00:02:06.740> him<00:02:06.889> aside<00:02:07.009> this<00:02:07.969> is<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.300> one<00:02:08.479> most

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
we'll set him aside this is the one most

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.839 
we'll set him aside this is the one most

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.890 
webbing is sculpted all of the black
paint<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.700> wash<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.300> goes<00:02:14.480> through

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900

so

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.070 
so
much<00:02:25.489> so<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.970> aware<00:02:26.269> that<00:02:26.330> sometimes<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> eyes

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
much so be aware that sometimes the eyes

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.490 
much so be aware that sometimes the eyes
are<00:02:27.489> more<00:02:28.489> akin<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.390> guy<00:02:29.629> who<00:02:29.690> has<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
but as far as articulation goes this guy

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.059 
but as far as articulation goes this guy
is<00:02:35.060> pretty<00:02:35.510> well<00:02:35.720> articulated<00:02:35.989> not<00:02:36.500> quite<00:02:36.860> so

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
is pretty well articulated not quite so

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.160 
is pretty well articulated not quite so

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
to give him a flip hand you can probably

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.869 
to give him a flip hand you can probably
do<00:03:11.840> that<00:03:12.019> he<00:03:12.409> is<00:03:12.440> known<00:03:12.739> for<00:03:12.769> losing<00:03:13.340> digits<00:03:13.700> as

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
do that he is known for losing digits as

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.089 
do that he is known for losing digits as
well<00:03:14.269> so<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.690> careful<00:03:15.079> with<00:03:15.379> those<00:03:15.739> fingers

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
well so be careful with those fingers

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.369 
well so be careful with those fingers
they<00:03:16.400> are<00:03:16.609> awfully<00:03:17.090> tiny<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:18.109> they<00:03:18.230> did

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
they are awfully tiny but they did

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.349 
they are awfully tiny but they did
sculpt<00:03:18.709> them<00:03:18.980> really<00:03:19.459> well<00:03:19.609> even<00:03:20.030> with<00:03:20.180> that

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
sculpt them really well even with that

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.140 
sculpt them really well even with that
hinge<00:03:20.629> in<00:03:20.810> there's<00:03:20.989> not<00:03:21.260> too<00:03:21.560> bad<00:03:21.829> AB<00:03:22.640> crunch

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150

leg way up there no problem at all and

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.009 
leg way up there no problem at all and
it<00:03:46.310> doesn't<00:03:46.489> look<00:03:46.760> too<00:03:46.970> bad<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.299> think<00:03:47.599> it's<00:03:47.930> a

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
it doesn't look too bad I think it's a

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.420 
it doesn't look too bad I think it's a
pretty<00:03:48.200> good<00:03:48.290> design<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.040> hips<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.370> do

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
pretty good design for the hips I do

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.970 
pretty good design for the hips I do
appreciate<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.299> is<00:03:50.480> a<00:03:50.510> T<00:03:50.840> joint<00:03:51.139> pretty

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
appreciate that it is a T joint pretty

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.210 
appreciate that it is a T joint pretty
loose<00:03:52.160> right<00:03:52.280> now<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:53.150> seems<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.750> be<00:03:53.780> common

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
loose right now that seems to be common

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.710 
loose right now that seems to be common
but<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> think<00:03:55.519> it's<00:03:55.639> probably<00:03:55.760> worth<00:03:56.209> dealing

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
but I think it's probably worth dealing

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.050 
but I think it's probably worth dealing
