00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
out of photoshop now I get this question

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.660 
out of photoshop now I get this question
a<00:00:23.140> lot<00:00:23.170> what's<00:00:23.619> what's<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.040> advantage<00:00:24.310> to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
a lot what's what's the advantage to

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.330 
a lot what's what's the advantage to
using<00:00:25.080> Lightroom<00:00:26.080> or<00:00:26.320> over<00:00:26.560> photoshop<00:00:26.980> why

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
using Lightroom or over photoshop why

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.700 
using Lightroom or over photoshop why
would<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.580> want<00:00:27.849> to<00:00:28.090> open<00:00:28.599> up<00:00:28.720> my<00:00:28.990> image<00:00:29.439> out<00:00:29.650> of

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
would I want to open up my image out of

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.770 
would I want to open up my image out of
Photoshop<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:30.610> then<00:00:30.730> into<00:00:30.970> silver<00:00:31.210> fxpro

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
Photoshop and then into silver fxpro

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.020 
Photoshop and then into silver fxpro
well<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.619> big<00:00:32.739> advantage<00:00:33.160> is<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.520> using<00:00:33.760> Smart

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
well the big advantage is to using Smart

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.820 
well the big advantage is to using Smart
Objects<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.020> reason<00:00:35.350> for<00:00:35.379> that<00:00:35.559> is<00:00:35.680> that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
Objects and the reason for that is that

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.830 
Objects and the reason for that is that
allows<00:00:36.309> us<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.670> open<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.059> image<00:00:37.330> up<00:00:37.480> again

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
allows us to open that image up again

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.930 
allows us to open that image up again
and<00:00:38.140> all<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.070> positions<00:00:39.460> that<00:00:39.520> we<00:00:39.670> had<00:00:39.790> on<00:00:39.910> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
and all the positions that we had on the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.360 
and all the positions that we had on the
slider<00:00:40.239> are<00:00:40.720> still<00:00:41.290> in<00:00:41.410> place<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:42.010> all<00:00:42.250> the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
slider are still in place and all the

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.070 
slider are still in place and all the
rest<00:00:42.520> its<00:00:42.730> net<00:00:42.970> allows<00:00:43.330> us<00:00:43.510> basically<00:00:43.840> to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
rest its net allows us basically to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.290 
rest its net allows us basically to
perform<00:00:44.500> non-destructive<00:00:45.250> editing<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.180> we

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
perform non-destructive editing so we

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.970 
perform non-destructive editing so we
can<00:00:46.420> open<00:00:46.510> up<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.809> file<00:00:47.050> over<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.680> over<00:00:47.770> again

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
can open up the file over and over again

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.860 
can open up the file over and over again
and<00:00:48.220> all<00:00:48.730> those<00:00:49.000> little<00:00:49.300> changes<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.690> we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
and all those little changes that we

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.170 
and all those little changes that we
made<00:00:49.899> are<00:00:50.320> still<00:00:50.620> in<00:00:50.739> place<00:00:50.770> now<00:00:51.760> if<00:00:51.940> we<00:00:52.059> open

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
made are still in place now if we open

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.450 
made are still in place now if we open
up<00:00:52.390> out<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> lightroom<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.980> silver<00:00:54.190> effects

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
up out a lightroom into silver effects

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.729 
up out a lightroom into silver effects
pearl<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:55.059> create<00:00:55.690> a<00:00:55.719> tiff<00:00:55.930> file<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.620> then

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
pearl and create a tiff file and then

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.830 
pearl and create a tiff file and then
make<00:00:56.950> our<00:00:57.100> adjustments<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.790> save<00:00:58.149> it<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.450> try

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
make our adjustments and save it and try

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.990 
make our adjustments and save it and try
to<00:00:58.870> open<00:00:59.079> up<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.440> file<00:00:59.710> again<00:01:00.160> we're<00:01:00.879> not

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
to open up that file again we're not

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.490 
to open up that file again we're not
going<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.210> see<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.510> position<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.110> sliders

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
going to see the position of the sliders

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.770 
going to see the position of the sliders
before<00:01:02.820> basically<00:01:03.820> we're<00:01:04.330> looking<00:01:04.600> at<00:01:04.690> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
before basically we're looking at the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.359 
before basically we're looking at the
black<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.140> white<00:01:05.259> conversion<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:06.100> we<00:01:06.220> have

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
black and white conversion and we have

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.590 
black and white conversion and we have
to<00:01:06.460> make<00:01:06.580> adjustments<00:01:06.729> from<00:01:07.210> there<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:07.570> we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
to make adjustments from there so we

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.139 
to make adjustments from there so we
lose<00:01:07.899> some<00:01:08.680> flexibility<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.820> really

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
lose some flexibility so it really

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.080 
lose some flexibility so it really
allows<00:01:10.899> for<00:01:11.289> a<00:01:11.320> lot<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.649> flexibility<00:01:12.430> using

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
allows for a lot of flexibility using

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.389 
allows for a lot of flexibility using
Photoshop<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:13.810> honestly<00:01:14.649> nowadays<00:01:15.160> that's

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
Photoshop and honestly nowadays that's

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.510 
Photoshop and honestly nowadays that's
primarily<00:01:15.670> how<00:01:16.030> I<00:01:16.060> do<00:01:16.240> it<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:16.810> create<00:01:17.520> smart

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
primarily how I do it is I create smart

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.150 
primarily how I do it is I create smart
object<00:01:18.880> files<00:01:19.179> and<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:20.020> edit<00:01:20.350> out<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.470> photoshop

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
object files and I edit out a photoshop

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.309 
object files and I edit out a photoshop
it<00:01:21.399> does<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.240> downside<00:01:22.690> of<00:01:22.720> course<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.080> these

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
it does the downside of course is these

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.690 
it does the downside of course is these
files<00:01:23.530> are<00:01:23.709> larger<00:01:24.069> because<00:01:24.190> there's<00:01:24.399> layers

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
files are larger because there's layers

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.580 
files are larger because there's layers
so<00:01:25.390> let<00:01:25.569> me<00:01:25.630> let<00:01:25.840> me<00:01:25.899> show<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.110> how<00:01:26.200> we<00:01:26.319> would

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
so let me let me show you how we would

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.290 
so let me let me show you how we would
do<00:01:26.709> that<00:01:26.860> here's<00:01:27.100> my<00:01:27.310> image<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.670> Lightroom<00:01:28.149> and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
do that here's my image in Lightroom and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.339 
do that here's my image in Lightroom and
i'm<00:01:28.780> going<00:01:28.959> to<00:01:29.020> right<00:01:29.259> click<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.920> hit<00:01:29.950> edit<00:01:30.940> in

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
i'm going to right click and hit edit in

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:34.559 
i'm going to right click and hit edit in
and<00:01:32.349> down<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.190> open<00:01:33.640> as<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.759> smart<00:01:34.000> object<00:01:34.179> in

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
and down to open as a smart object in

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.580 
and down to open as a smart object in
photoshop<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.050> notice<00:01:38.289> we<00:01:38.349> get<00:01:38.470> this

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
photoshop so you notice we get this

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.010 
photoshop so you notice we get this
little<00:01:38.800> dialog<00:01:39.160> box<00:01:39.429> here<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.149> we're<00:01:40.899> going

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
little dialog box here and we're going

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.990 
little dialog box here and we're going
to<00:01:41.050> want<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.319> go<00:01:41.500> with<00:01:41.860> embed<00:01:42.340> with<00:01:42.520> profile

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
to want to go with embed with profile

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.880 
to want to go with embed with profile
because<00:01:43.209> the<00:01:43.479> default<00:01:43.810> profile<00:01:44.259> in<00:01:44.410> lightroom

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
because the default profile in lightroom

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.760 
because the default profile in lightroom
is<00:01:45.099> pro<00:01:45.399> photo<00:01:45.640> RGB<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.539> even<00:01:47.410> though<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.619> is

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
is pro photo RGB and even though this is

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.139 
is pro photo RGB and even though this is
more<00:01:47.920> important<00:01:48.280> for<00:01:48.369> color<00:01:48.580> work<00:01:48.849> it's<00:01:49.090> still

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
more important for color work it's still

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.150 
more important for color work it's still
very<00:01:49.479> important<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:50.020> have<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.500> white<00:01:50.709> again<00:01:51.009> as

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
very important to have is white again as

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.980 
very important to have is white again as
possible<00:01:51.729> for<00:01:51.910> black<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.179> white<00:01:52.390> work<00:01:52.750> so

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
possible for black and white work so

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.070 
possible for black and white work so
just<00:01:53.020> hit<00:01:53.349> OK<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:55.649> you'll<00:01:57.599> notice<00:01:58.599> right<00:01:58.840> here

just hit OK and you'll notice right here
take<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.649> look<00:01:59.709> at<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.039> layer<00:02:00.819> right<00:02:01.030> here

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
take a look at this layer right here

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.080 
take a look at this layer right here
this<00:02:02.009> shows<00:02:03.009> that<00:02:03.069> it's<00:02:03.399> been<00:02:03.520> converted<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:04.000> a

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
this shows that it's been converted to a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.600 
this shows that it's been converted to a
smart<00:02:04.450> object<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.830> all<00:02:06.069> we<00:02:06.220> need<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.399> do

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
smart object and so all we need to do

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.199 
smart object and so all we need to do
now<00:02:06.849> is<00:02:07.149> just<00:02:07.239> launched<00:02:07.989> our<00:02:08.170> program

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
now is just launched our program

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.390 
now is just launched our program
silverfox<00:02:10.209> pro<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.810> let's<00:02:10.959> click<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.500> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.830

image much I just want to show you the
general<00:02:19.720> concept<00:02:19.959> behind<00:02:20.319> smart<00:02:20.830> object<00:02:21.190> so

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
general concept behind smart object so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.589 
general concept behind smart object so
let's<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.580> make<00:02:21.670> some<00:02:21.849> quick<00:02:22.030> adjustments

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
let's increase the contrast a little bit

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.930 
let's increase the contrast a little bit
maybe<00:02:27.040> in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
maybe in

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.780 
maybe in
the<00:02:28.030> structure<00:02:28.870> slider<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:30.210> bit<00:02:32.550> will<00:02:33.550> bring

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the structure slider a bit will bring

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.500 
the structure slider a bit will bring
the<00:02:34.000> mid-tones<00:02:34.480> up<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.410> little<00:02:35.710> bit<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.150> notice

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the mid-tones up a little bit so notice

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.330 
the mid-tones up a little bit so notice
these<00:02:37.600> adjustments<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.350> we've<00:02:38.470> made<00:02:38.740> here

those adjustments will be saved back to
the<00:03:18.850> smart<00:03:19.090> filter<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.660> we<00:03:19.750> can<00:03:19.870> go<00:03:19.990> back<00:03:20.200> in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
the smart filter so we can go back in

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.900 
the smart filter so we can go back in
this<00:03:20.590> over<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.100> over<00:03:21.250> again<00:03:21.520> and<00:03:21.640> make

this over and over again and make

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.390 
this over and over again and make
adjustments<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:23.890> save<00:03:24.130> this

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
adjustments and then we can save this

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.310 
adjustments and then we can save this
delight<00:03:24.880> room<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.360> open<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.690> back<00:03:25.720> up<00:03:25.900> again

as<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:26.980> smart<00:03:27.460> object<00:03:27.640> so<00:03:27.910> it's<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.570> very

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
as a smart object so it's it's very

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.410 
as a smart object so it's it's very
handy<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.470> very<00:03:29.860> easy<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.310> work<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.490> now

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
handy and very easy to work with now

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
handy and very easy to work with now
another<00:03:32.170> technique<00:03:32.770> that's<00:03:33.010> really<00:03:33.340> cool<00:03:33.580> is

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
another technique that's really cool is

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.580 
another technique that's really cool is
we<00:03:33.790> can<00:03:33.940> change<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.270> opacity<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.110> filter

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
we can change the opacity of this filter

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.710 
we can change the opacity of this filter
so<00:03:36.220> if<00:03:36.580> we<00:03:36.760> click<00:03:36.940> right<00:03:37.270> here<00:03:37.300> you'll<00:03:37.660> see

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
so if we click right here you'll see

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.570 
so if we click right here you'll see
double<00:03:38.440> click<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.830> change<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.310> blunt

it<00:03:43.239> takes<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.480> couple<00:03:43.630> seconds<00:03:44.080> it's<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.410> to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
it takes a couple seconds it's going to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.430 
it takes a couple seconds it's going to
open<00:03:44.739> up<00:03:44.950> another<00:03:45.220> window<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.410> go

open up another window and here we go

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.180 
open up another window and here we go
and<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:50.860> can<00:03:50.890> change<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.610> path<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:53.190> can

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
and we can change the path of this can

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.729 
and we can change the path of this can
drop<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.610> down<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.850> little<00:03:55.120> bit<00:03:55.360> if<00:03:55.630> we<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.650> to

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
drop it down a little bit if we want to

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.650 
drop it down a little bit if we want to
blend<00:03:57.010> between<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.670> black<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:57.940> white<00:03:58.390> and

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
blend between the black and white and

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.290 
blend between the black and white and
the<00:03:59.200> color<00:04:02.250> maybe<00:04:03.250> for<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.550> little<00:04:03.610> effect<00:04:04.060> like

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
the color maybe for a little effect like

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.040 
the color maybe for a little effect like
that<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.970> that's<00:04:07.150> kind<00:04:07.330> of<00:04:07.390> way<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.570> desaturate

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
that so that's kind of way to desaturate

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.810 
that so that's kind of way to desaturate
the<00:04:08.440> image<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.830> blend<00:04:09.130> in<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.550> black<00:04:09.790> and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
the image and blend in the black and

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.759 
the image and blend in the black and
white<00:04:10.150> filter<00:04:10.480> at<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.780> same<00:04:11.050> time<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:11.560> kind

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
white filter at the same time it's kind

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.740 
white filter at the same time it's kind
of<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.920> cool<00:04:12.190> effect<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.269> one<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.660> the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
of a cool effect in just one of the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.440 
of a cool effect in just one of the
advantages<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.620> using<00:04:14.650> smart<00:04:15.340> filters<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.090> a

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
advantages to using smart filters and a

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.720 
advantages to using smart filters and a
very<00:04:16.690> basic<00:04:16.989> approach<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.830> Smart<00:04:18.100> Filters<00:04:18.310> now

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
very basic approach to Smart Filters now

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.039 
very basic approach to Smart Filters now
I'm<00:04:18.850> going<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> show<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.330> another<00:04:19.600> episode<00:04:19.870> how

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
I'm going to show it another episode how

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.720 
I'm going to show it another episode how
you<00:04:20.109> can<00:04:20.320> stack<00:04:20.620> several<00:04:20.980> Smart<00:04:21.549> Filters

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
you can stack several Smart Filters

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.330 
you can stack several Smart Filters
together<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.990> create<00:04:23.230> some<00:04:23.620> really<00:04:23.980> cool

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
together to create some really cool

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.730 
together to create some really cool
effects<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.630> hope<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.870> was<00:04:26.140> helpful<00:04:26.169> so
