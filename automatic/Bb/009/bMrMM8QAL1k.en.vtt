ago our mama aleem discovered that she

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.439 
ago our mama aleem discovered that she
could<00:00:23.840> burn<00:00:24.109> her<00:00:24.439> original<00:00:25.010> tacky<00:00:25.310> glue<00:00:25.550> to

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
could burn her original tacky glue to

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.259 
could burn her original tacky glue to
create<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.080> look<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:27.470> metal<00:00:27.939> that's<00:00:28.939> right

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269

and I'm going to show you how for this

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.790 
and I'm going to show you how for this
project<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.870> use<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.260> aleene's<00:00:45.590> original

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
project I use the aleene's original

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.610 
project I use the aleene's original
tacky<00:00:46.399> glue<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.660> only<00:00:47.690> glue<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.469> I

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
tacky glue it's the only glue that I

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.270 
tacky glue it's the only glue that I
recommend<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:49.610> technique<00:00:51.129> now<00:00:52.129> I've

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
recommend for this technique now I've

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.939 
recommend for this technique now I've
already<00:00:52.489> glued<00:00:53.090> two<00:00:53.719> thicknesses<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.469> brown

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
already glued two thicknesses of brown

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.090 
already glued two thicknesses of brown
bags<00:00:55.250> together<00:00:55.489> with<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.210> glue<00:00:56.449> I've<00:00:57.199> put<00:00:57.949> a

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
bags together with the glue I've put a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.670 
bags together with the glue I've put a
18<00:00:58.640> gauge<00:00:58.879> wire<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.420> between<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.109> I<00:01:00.320> have<00:01:00.500> my

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
18 gauge wire in between and I have my

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.080 
18 gauge wire in between and I have my
pattern<00:01:01.100> on<00:01:01.280> my<00:01:02.120> paper<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.780> cut<00:01:03.590> it<00:01:03.710> out<00:01:03.859> and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.350 

this<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.150> what<00:01:08.420> you<00:01:08.570> have<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:09.939> then<00:01:10.939> put<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
this is what you have I then put the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.170 
this is what you have I then put the
glue<00:01:11.650> onto<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.250> butterfly<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:13.790> Brownback

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
glue onto the butterfly the Brownback

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.620 
glue onto the butterfly the Brownback
butterfly<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:19.280> just<00:01:19.520> use<00:01:19.759> my<00:01:19.790> finger<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
butterfly and I just use my finger and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
butterfly and I just use my finger and
apply<00:01:20.930> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.270 

you<00:01:34.060> need<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.299> generous<00:01:34.780> amount<00:01:35.039> make<00:01:36.039> sure

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
you need a generous amount make sure

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.359 
you need a generous amount make sure
that<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.579> cover<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.659> brown<00:01:37.840> bag<00:01:41.039> because<00:01:42.039> you

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
that you cover the brown bag because you

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.060 
that you cover the brown bag because you
are<00:01:42.460> actually<00:01:42.700> burning<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.390> glue<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:44.070> not

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
are actually burning the glue and not

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.270 
are actually burning the glue and not
the<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.759> bag<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.329> glue<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:46.960> what<00:01:47.200> makes<00:01:48.039> it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
the the bag the glue is what makes it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.969 
the the bag the glue is what makes it
look<00:01:48.460> like<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:49.740> metal<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.720> next<00:01:53.020> step<00:01:53.200> is<00:01:53.409> to

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
look like it's metal the next step is to

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.319 
look like it's metal the next step is to
put<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.759> wet<00:01:55.179> glue<00:01:55.420> over<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:56.079> candle<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
put the wet glue over a candle and this

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.620 
put the wet glue over a candle and this
is<00:01:58.539> what<00:01:58.780> burnishes<00:01:59.439> the<00:02:00.220> glue<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.789> makes<00:02:01.450> it

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
is what burnishes the glue and makes it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.990 
is what burnishes the glue and makes it
black<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.259> you're<00:02:02.770> not<00:02:02.979> putting<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.670> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
black and you're not putting it in the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.469 
black and you're not putting it in the
candle<00:02:04.360> flame<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:04.959> barely<00:02:05.349> above<00:02:05.890> it

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
candle flame it's just barely above it

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.419 
candle flame it's just barely above it
see<00:02:07.479> how<00:02:07.929> it<00:02:08.019> turns<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.410> black<00:02:08.590> see<00:02:09.250> when<00:02:09.399> I

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
see how it turns it black see when I

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:32.750 
see how it turns it black see when I
completely<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.620> whole<00:02:11.830> butterfly

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.059 

and<00:02:33.760> when<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.330> completely<00:02:35.010> done<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.860> have

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
and when it's completely done you have

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.420 
and when it's completely done you have
this<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:40.080> has<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> soda<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.130> what<00:02:42.280> you're

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
this it has a soda on it so what you're

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.000 
this it has a soda on it so what you're
going<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.090> you're<00:02:43.239> going<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.480> simply

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
going to do is you're going to simply

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.170 
going to do is you're going to simply
take<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.220> paper<00:02:45.430> towel<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.230> wipe<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.440> its<00:02:47.739> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.870 

and<00:02:53.250> then<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:54.519> take<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.500> gold<00:02:56.769> paste<00:02:57.220> on

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
and then I just take the gold paste on

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.229 
and then I just take the gold paste on
my<00:02:58.150> finger<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:59.519> then<00:03:00.519> just<00:03:00.880> kind<00:03:01.120> of

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
my finger and then just kind of

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.680 
my finger and then just kind of
highlight<00:03:02.010> all<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.069> crevices<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.970> you've

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
highlight all the crevices that you've

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.840 
highlight all the crevices that you've
created<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.380> your<00:03:05.590> burnt<00:03:05.830> glue<00:03:11.850> super

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
created with your burnt glue super

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.460 
created with your burnt glue super
simple<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.780> beautiful<00:03:13.810> technique<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
simple in a beautiful technique the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.890 
simple in a beautiful technique the
number<00:03:18.160> one<00:03:18.489> question<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.450> get<00:03:19.750> about

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
number one question that we get about

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.410 
number one question that we get about
this<00:03:20.290> technique<00:03:20.799> is<00:03:20.980> how<00:03:21.459> did<00:03:21.730> she<00:03:21.940> think<00:03:22.180> of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
this technique is how did she think of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.110 
this technique is how did she think of
that<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.140> actually<00:03:24.099> one<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.849> liens

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that and actually one of the liens

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.720 
that and actually one of the liens
designers<00:03:25.810> way<00:03:26.170> back<00:03:26.410> when<00:03:26.620> was<00:03:27.250> testing<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
designers way back when was testing the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.120 
designers way back when was testing the
aleene's<00:03:28.120> tacky<00:03:28.209> glue<00:03:28.690> for<00:03:29.349> flammability<00:03:29.860> and

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
aleene's tacky glue for flammability and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.370 
aleene's tacky glue for flammability and
found<00:03:30.640> out<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.090> she<00:03:31.480> could<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.930> look<00:03:32.170> of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
found out that she could get the look of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.190 
found out that she could get the look of
metal<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> love<00:03:34.360> about<00:03:34.390> this<00:03:34.750> technique

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
metal what I love about this technique

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.440 
metal what I love about this technique
is<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.560> works<00:03:35.799> just<00:03:36.070> as<00:03:36.220> great<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.790> tiny

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
is it works just as great on a tiny
