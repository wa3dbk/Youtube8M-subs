steering rack which are efore these
external<00:01:55.290> torques<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.310> works<00:01:56.729> with

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
external torques so that works with

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.249 
external torques so that works with
torques<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> e-40<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.280> four<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.640> them

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
torques so the e-40 this four of them

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.480 
torques so the e-40 this four of them
you're<00:02:01.259> gonna<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> lower<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:01.890> subframe

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
you're gonna have to lower your subframe

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.499 
you're gonna have to lower your subframe
you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.719> down<00:02:03.899> already

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
you can see that one is down already

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.949 
you can see that one is down already
then<00:02:07.160> go<00:02:08.160> ahead<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.700> unbolt<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.450> tie<00:02:09.660> rods

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
then go ahead and unbolt your tie rods

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.970 
then go ahead and unbolt your tie rods
if<00:02:10.500> you're<00:02:10.770> capable<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
if you're capable of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.830 
if you're capable of
loosening<00:02:12.980> everything<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:13.939> be<00:02:14.510> better<00:02:14.719> off

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
loosening everything you be better off

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.119 
loosening everything you be better off
if<00:02:15.079> you<00:02:15.170> actually<00:02:15.319> take<00:02:15.560> them<00:02:15.709> off<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:15.980> rack

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
if you actually take them off the rack

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.610 
if you actually take them off the rack
before<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.519> pull<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.849> but<00:02:17.540> mine<00:02:18.019> rest<00:02:18.260> sold

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
before you pull it but mine rest sold

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.920 
before you pull it but mine rest sold
and<00:02:18.859> tied<00:02:19.069> up<00:02:19.299> they<00:02:20.299> just<00:02:20.329> wouldn't<00:02:20.719> come<00:02:20.870> out

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and tied up they just wouldn't come out

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.649 
and tied up they just wouldn't come out
so<00:02:21.459> after<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:24.680> kind<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.069> drop<00:02:25.659> the

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
so after that we kind of drop the

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.550 
so after that we kind of drop the
subframe<00:02:27.230> which<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.890> bolted<00:02:28.099> in<00:02:28.459> with<00:02:29.560> three

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
subframe which is bolted in with three

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.869 
subframe which is bolted in with three
large<00:02:31.159> bolts<00:02:31.819> from<00:02:32.120> underneath<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.280> here

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
large bolts from underneath and see here

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.030 
large bolts from underneath and see here
these<00:02:35.780> are<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.139> bolts<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.900> 16<00:02:39.319> 18

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
these are the bolts think of 16 18

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.209 
these are the bolts think of 16 18
really<00:02:40.609> good<00:02:40.730> 18<00:02:41.120> millimeter<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:43.040> really

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
really good 18 millimeter you really

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.050 
really good 18 millimeter you really
don't<00:02:43.400> need<00:02:43.489> too<00:02:43.670> many<00:02:43.790> tools<00:02:44.980> also<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.760> order

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
don't need too many tools also in order

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.539 
don't need too many tools also in order
to<00:02:47.150> disconnect<00:02:47.769> hope<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.889> can<00:02:49.069> see<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
to disconnect hope you can see that

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.409 
to disconnect hope you can see that
there<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.810> power-steering<00:02:51.139> line<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:53.120> extra

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
there the power-steering line the extra

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.229 
there the power-steering line the extra
line<00:02:53.689> you<00:02:54.620> know<00:02:54.709> just<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.790> you

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
line you know just like that one you

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.119 
line you know just like that one you
want<00:02:56.419> to<00:02:56.510> go<00:02:56.599> from<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.169> top<00:02:57.409> and<00:02:57.709> there's<00:02:57.859> two

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
want to go from the top and there's two

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.270 
want to go from the top and there's two
bolts<00:02:58.569> one<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> 21<00:03:00.290> millimeter<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
bolts one is a 21 millimeter and the

bolts one is a 21 millimeter and the
other<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.639> 19<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.480> what<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.079> did<00:03:03.379> I

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
other one is a 19 and what I did I

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.289 
other one is a 19 and what I did I
actually<00:03:04.900> use<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.319> universal<00:03:07.250> joint<00:03:07.760> for<00:03:08.150> that

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
actually use a universal joint for that

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.250 
actually use a universal joint for that
and<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:11.290> 1/2<00:03:12.290> inch<00:03:12.669> ratchet<00:03:13.669> and<00:03:14.090> extension<00:03:14.260> and

and a 1/2 inch ratchet and extension and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.860 
and a 1/2 inch ratchet and extension and
just<00:03:15.859> unbolt<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.489> whole<00:03:16.639> thing<00:03:16.909> then

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
just unbolt it the whole thing then

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.949 
just unbolt it the whole thing then
there's<00:03:18.049> another<00:03:18.310> e-40<00:03:19.510> voltage<00:03:20.510> enough<00:03:20.690> loop

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
there's another e-40 voltage enough loop

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.809 
there's another e-40 voltage enough loop
loosened<00:03:21.530> which<00:03:21.620> comes<00:03:21.859> straight<00:03:22.129> from<00:03:22.190> your

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
loosened which comes straight from your

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
steering wheel connects to the rod

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.000 
steering wheel connects to the rod
basically<00:03:37.069> in<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.310> rod<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:37.699> rack<00:03:38.889> you<00:03:39.889> can

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
basically in the rod to the rack you can

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.140 
basically in the rod to the rack you can
see<00:03:40.250> right<00:03:40.400> there<00:03:40.699> the<00:03:41.060> engine<00:03:41.419> mount<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.790> and

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
see right there the engine mount so and

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.110 
see right there the engine mount so and
here's<00:03:44.949> where<00:03:45.949> the<00:03:46.040> bolts<00:03:46.340> go<00:03:46.400> by<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.849> way<00:03:47.060> you

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
here's where the bolts go by the way you

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.849 
here's where the bolts go by the way you
have<00:03:47.449> in<00:03:47.599> the<00:03:47.689> front<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.199> hope<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.470> can<00:03:48.620> see

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
have in the front I hope you can see

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.159 
have in the front I hope you can see
that<00:03:49.069> there's<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> pilot<00:03:49.849> pin<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.780> will<00:03:50.989> help

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
that there's a pilot pin this will help

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.770 
that there's a pilot pin this will help
you<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.439> relocate<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:52.220> subframe<00:03:52.939> later<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.389> so

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
you to relocate the subframe later on so

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.569 
you to relocate the subframe later on so
when<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:54.409> drop<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:54.859> it<00:03:54.979> may<00:03:55.189> be<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.430> little

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
when you drop it it may be a little

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.039 
when you drop it it may be a little
difficult<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:56.090> actually<00:03:56.389> get<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.629> down<00:03:56.810> in<00:03:56.989> the

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
difficult to actually get it down in the

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.509 
difficult to actually get it down in the
beginning<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:57.889> you<00:03:57.979> just<00:03:58.129> wriggle<00:03:58.400> out<00:03:58.459> a

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
beginning so you just wriggle out a

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.999 
beginning so you just wriggle out a
little<00:03:58.729> bit<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.209> used<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.930> three-ton<00:04:00.560> jack<00:04:00.859> to

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.009 
little bit I used a three-ton jack to

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.749 
little bit I used a three-ton jack to
support<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:02.359> bring<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.199> down<00:04:03.319> slowly<00:04:03.759> and

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.759 
support it to bring it down slowly and

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:08.110 
support it to bring it down slowly and
after<00:04:05.629> that<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.229> should<00:04:06.259> be<00:04:06.680> able<00:04:07.009> to<00:04:07.340> just

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
after that you should be able to just

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.599 
after that you should be able to just
pull<00:04:08.389> your<00:04:08.540> steering<00:04:08.810> rack<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> right

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
pull your steering rack to the right

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.770 
pull your steering rack to the right
underneath<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.620> oil<00:04:12.620> pan<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:14.150> can<00:04:14.329> see<00:04:14.569> that

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
underneath the oil pan you can see that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.870 
underneath the oil pan you can see that
here<00:04:15.079> maybe

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
here maybe

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.260 
here maybe
a<00:04:16.110> little<00:04:17.110> side<00:04:17.380> view<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:18.040> don't<00:04:18.880> need<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.120> oil

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
a little side view I don't need the oil

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.270 
a little side view I don't need the oil
pan<00:04:19.540> to<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.140> then<00:04:20.440> bring<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.830> out<00:04:20.950> in

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
pan to the right then bring it out in

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.920 
pan to the right then bring it out in
the<00:04:21.670> back<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.000> little<00:04:22.330> bit<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:24.810> pull<00:04:25.810> it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
the back a little bit and pull it

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.400 
the back a little bit and pull it
straight<00:04:26.080> out<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.190> back<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:29.020> after<00:04:29.200> that
