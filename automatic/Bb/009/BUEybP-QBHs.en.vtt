sour for me but I mean I could get used
to<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.290> could<00:02:21.500> add<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:21.740> tiny<00:02:22.190> little

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
to it one you could add a tiny little

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.640 
to it one you could add a tiny little
bit<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.790> manuka<00:02:23.090> honey<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:24.080> add<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.350> bit<00:02:24.620> of

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
bit of manuka honey to add a bit of

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.370 
bit of manuka honey to add a bit of
sweetening<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.940> if<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:27.020> find<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
sweetening to it if you find that a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
sweetening to it if you find that a
little<00:02:27.620> bit<00:02:27.740> tart<00:02:28.040> well<00:02:28.490> that<00:02:31.570> well<00:02:32.570> that

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
little bit tart well that well that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.190 
little bit tart well that well that
effect<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.670> what<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.390> does<00:02:35.540> for<00:02:35.690> me<00:02:35.780> though<00:02:35.930> if

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
effect the what it does for me though if

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.170 
effect the what it does for me though if
I<00:02:36.350> put<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.980> good<00:02:37.130> no<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.370> think<00:02:37.490> if<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:37.940> kinda

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
I put so good no I think if it kinda

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.300 
I put so good no I think if it kinda
increases<00:02:38.720> palatability<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:39.740> you're<00:02:40.040> fine

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
increases palatability then you're fine

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.390 
increases palatability then you're fine
doing<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.900> now<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:41.960> finding<00:02:42.440> it<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:43.280> is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
doing that now you finding it this is

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.370 
doing that now you finding it this is
fine<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.060> don't<00:02:44.120> take<00:02:44.360> sugar<00:02:44.540> in<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
fine as it is I don't take sugar in to

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.890 
fine as it is I don't take sugar in to
your<00:02:45.500> coffees<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.190> it's<00:02:46.430> fine<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:46.820> hot<00:02:46.970> it's

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.820 
much as you can many many of us parents
with<00:03:31.430> children<00:03:31.940> on<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.180> spectrum<00:03:32.300> are<00:03:32.870> super

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
with children on the spectrum are super

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.250 
with children on the spectrum are super
stressed<00:03:34.160> at<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.760> we<00:03:35.270> find<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.780> difficult

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
stressed at so we find it difficult

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.720 
stressed at so we find it difficult
waking<00:03:36.709> up<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.010> morning<00:03:37.459> because

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
waking up in the morning because

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.180 
waking up in the morning because
cortisol<00:03:38.540> naturally<00:03:39.170> wakes<00:03:39.380> us<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.740> which<00:03:39.980> is

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
cortisol naturally wakes us up which is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.020 
cortisol naturally wakes us up which is
a<00:03:40.400> hormone<00:03:41.180> from<00:03:41.570> our<00:03:41.720> adrenal<00:03:42.260> glands<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.030> we

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
a hormone from our adrenal glands and we

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.850 
a hormone from our adrenal glands and we
need<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.390> kick-start<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:45.140> adrenals<00:03:45.650> by

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
need to kick-start the adrenals by

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.979 
need to kick-start the adrenals by
giving<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.489> caffeine<00:03:46.970> it's<00:03:47.660> giving<00:03:47.900> them

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
giving it caffeine it's giving them

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.020 
giving it caffeine it's giving them
caffeine<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.650> boost<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.160> level<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.520> cortisol

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
caffeine to boost the level of cortisol

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.570 
caffeine to boost the level of cortisol
so<00:03:50.270> we<00:03:50.390> feel<00:03:50.630> wide<00:03:51.050> awake<00:03:51.320> in<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> morning<00:03:51.980> so
