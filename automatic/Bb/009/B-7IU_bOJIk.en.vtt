 just good and it is only two to one 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.380
 Almost it would have been worse with a counterattack Schiess Maik Tacke 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.820
 Puck on the post 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.230

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 Direct acceptance of the 4 2 2 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.690
 that would probably have been the decision was the answer of the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.180
 Lindauer follows promptly Mike Dolezal shoots the puck for 4 to 3 in the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.830
