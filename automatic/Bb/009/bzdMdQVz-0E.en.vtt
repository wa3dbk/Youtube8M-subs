leak<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.689> just<00:02:17.870> letting<00:02:18.079> research<00:02:18.349> up<00:02:18.500> all

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
leak if you just letting research up all

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
leak if you just letting research up all
these<00:02:18.709> cards

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.570 

this<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> lot<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.800> lands<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.280> I'm<00:02:33.370> getting

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
this is a lot of lands that I'm getting

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.030 
this is a lot of lands that I'm getting
for<00:02:33.790> free<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:38.260> is<00:02:38.379> all<00:02:38.500> an<00:02:38.650> effort<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
for free and this is all an effort to

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.089 
for free and this is all an effort to
avoid<00:02:39.250> man<00:02:39.700> leaking<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.239> son<00:02:40.480> blessed<00:02:40.690> angel

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
avoid man leaking my son blessed angel

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.020 
avoid man leaking my son blessed angel
which<00:02:42.099> should<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.640> put<00:02:42.730> them<00:02:42.879> in<00:02:42.940> an

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
which should really put them in an

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:53.360 
which should really put them in an
awkward<00:02:43.180> position

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.759 

I<00:02:53.510> can<00:02:54.510> actually<00:02:54.780> double<00:02:54.959> block<00:02:55.319> this<00:02:55.500> guy

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
I can actually double block this guy

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.550 
I can actually double block this guy
will<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.819> three<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.810> wait<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.260> would<00:02:58.379> work

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
will do three not wait that would work

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.490 
will do three not wait that would work
so<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.310> we're<00:02:59.489> not<00:02:59.580> doing<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:03.409> yep<00:03:04.409> drawcard

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
so now we're not doing that yep drawcard

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:18.410 
so now we're not doing that yep drawcard
trade<00:03:07.500> yep<00:03:08.489> drontal<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> card<00:03:10.129> it<00:03:11.129> seems<00:03:11.459> fine

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.330 

we'll<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.230> draw<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> day<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.709> judgment<00:03:20.069> avoid

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
we'll just draw a day of judgment avoid

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:30.250 
we'll just draw a day of judgment avoid
the<00:03:20.459> whole<00:03:20.580> thing

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.120 

I've<00:03:31.260> got<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> play<00:03:31.650> an<00:03:31.770> untapped<00:03:32.130> land<00:03:32.430> here

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
I've got to play an untapped land here

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:47.930 
I've got to play an untapped land here
one<00:03:35.130> two<00:03:35.490> three<00:03:36.110> four<00:03:37.110> five<00:03:38.450> six<00:03:46.160> and<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:47.400> son

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
blessed angel for your mirror Crusader

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.780 
blessed angel for your mirror Crusader
is<00:03:49.320> more<00:03:49.650> than<00:03:49.800> fair<00:03:50.040> especially<00:03:50.280> when<00:03:50.700> you

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
is more than fair especially when you

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.540 
is more than fair especially when you
don't<00:03:50.880> get<00:03:51.060> yours<00:03:51.270> back<00:03:52.220> yeah<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.490> to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
don't get yours back yeah it's going to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.890 
don't get yours back yeah it's going to
make<00:03:53.610> me<00:03:53.700> kill<00:03:53.880> my<00:03:53.970> bird<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.510> he's<00:03:54.630> treating<00:03:54.870> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
make me kill my bird so he's treating a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.980 
make me kill my bird so he's treating a
bird<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.380> mana<00:03:55.560> leak<00:03:56.840> well<00:03:57.840> maybe<00:03:58.080> not<00:03:59.990> cool

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
bird for a mana leak well maybe not cool

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.600 
bird for a mana leak well maybe not cool
so<00:04:01.440> he<00:04:01.530> does<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.890> mana<00:04:02.070> leak<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.340> hand<00:04:02.490> it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
so he does have the mana leak in hand it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.840 
so he does have the mana leak in hand it
seems<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:04.130> just<00:04:05.130> let<00:04:05.280> me<00:04:05.370> get<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:05.670> far

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
seems like you just let me get so far

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.300 
seems like you just let me get so far
ahead<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:09.710> I'm<00:04:10.710> actually<00:04:10.890> going<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.220> go

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
ahead that I'm actually going to go

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
anyway so I do have a ton of guys that

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.590 
anyway so I do have a ton of guys that
would<00:05:30.980> be<00:05:31.130> really<00:05:31.400> good<00:05:31.640> right<00:05:31.880> now<00:05:33.400> in<00:05:34.600> the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
would be really good right now in the

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:51.590 
would be really good right now in the
deck<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:35.900> mean<00:05:38.950> that's<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:40.040> pretty<00:05:40.070> good<00:05:40.370> one

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.100 

taken<00:05:52.600> seven<00:05:52.930> all<00:05:53.350> right

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.390 

the<00:06:00.740> runtime<00:06:02.410> like<00:06:03.410> I<00:06:03.560> should<00:06:03.860> be<00:06:03.980> pretty<00:06:04.130> hard

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
the runtime like I should be pretty hard

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:16.159 
the runtime like I should be pretty hard
for<00:06:04.430> him<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.640> deal<00:06:04.850> with

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.880 

alright<00:06:17.169> i<00:06:17.289> guess<00:06:17.470> that's<00:06:17.830> how<00:06:18.460> hard<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:18.789> is
