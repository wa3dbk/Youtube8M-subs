00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
focusing on that so that when it comes

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.569 
focusing on that so that when it comes
on<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> piece<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.719> I'm<00:00:46.500> able<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> accept<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
on that piece and I'm able to accept it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
cancer and I realized I had to spend

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.790 
cancer and I realized I had to spend
more<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> river<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.440> dump<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
more time on the river and then dump I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
cancer that's a very conservative number

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
cancer that's a very conservative number
it's<00:01:53.460> probably<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:53.940> higher<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:55.710> leaves

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's probably much higher that leaves
