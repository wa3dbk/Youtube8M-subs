00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.799
 the child who are the main ones 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.860
 components of our body and body 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.170
 and all bodies 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.390
 events are complex molecules too 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 very complex in some cases but they do 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 part of our daily life 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.510
 though most of us don't 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 know in fact they are at the base of the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.550
 our nutrition with the addition of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.920
 mineral salts and vitamins 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.890
 carbohydrates for example include 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 sugars and polysaccharides i 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 sugars are substances that are found 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.860
 in the ugly but also in the milk in many 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.010
 and other foods are generally 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.260
 recognizable by the sweet taste i 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.720
 polysaccharides which are also formed from 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 sugars are not sweet but make up 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.470
 the basis of the diet of most 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 part of human beings 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.610
 they are in constituent bases of all 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.160
 starchy foods and their derivatives such as 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.680
 wheat potatoes corn and rice but 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.600
 also pasta, bread, polenta yes 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 also find many other foods among 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.680
 which for example legumes such as beans 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.680
 chickpeas lentils and so on 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.440
 lipids are substances 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.480
 fat like condiments such as oil and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.550
 the butter but they are found in remarkable 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.800
 quantity also in some types of meat 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.780
 in eggs and in different vegetables such as 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.490
 for example the avocado they play 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.530
 mainly the role of substance of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.840
 reserve because they are very rich in 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.760
 power 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.410
 proteins are perhaps the category of 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.080
 we read is more complex and more 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.090
 varied that exists for this very many 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.250
 food bridge contain some 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.900
 quantity when our diet 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.990
 the most protein-rich foods are 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.630
 meat eggs and fish and their derivatives such as 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.040
 for example, the cured meats among the vegetables one 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.060
 important source of protein is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.060
 consisting of legumes 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.470
 the last category of biomolecules is 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.440
 consisting of the nucleic acids they 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.840
 include the rna and the well-known DNA 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.630
 all cells contain some 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 quantity of DNA since it as perhaps 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.490
 you know it performs the memory function 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.410
 hereditary every cell to its own 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.390
 quantity of DNA but this is not the case 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.000
 accumulates specifically within 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.490
 therefore the living organism is not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.870
 particularly important as a source 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.940
 feed 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.620
 despite all this, all the bodies 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.390
 they own in large quantities and us 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.040
 we will go in search of the DNA inside 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.990
 of a banana 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 this will be an opportunity for a simple one 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.000
 and fun laboratory experience
