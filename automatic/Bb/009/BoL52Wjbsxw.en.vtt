00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all today we will see 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.990
 together how to work the song 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.220
 i'm not which of kingston and blaco i 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.759
 offers you two versions at this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.519
 song one with the chords crossed out and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.750
 the other meaning still barred and you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.130
 proposes to start earlier to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.289
 the agreements only have a tracker that go 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 turn so I give them to you in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.539
 the order the minor the six miners the the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 minor and theirs and without if you want 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.380
 play without bar and we will do them 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:36.290
 like that so the minor 0.2 and 0.1 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.310
 the six miners there by cons we are going to be 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 obliged to make a scale and this is the 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:50.690
 alone so like that 2 2 4 k 3 2 the 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.710
 minor 0-0 2-2 1-0 and the nine months 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.020
 we do not add 002 3 2 so that was 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.400
 for agreements without bar and from 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.200
 now the so-called agreements compared 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.570
 besides it was that I advise you 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.860
 if you want to mastered it really does 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.780
 a song that sounds better 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.070
 we'll have empty cords that's 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.790
 disgusting so it's better to 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.530
 play the bach playing is so we're going 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.180
 make a bet in the seventh box so the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.509
 speaking in is a check and we will 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:24.050
 play this chord this chord there so that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:27.290
 will be the minor so we are at 7 7 6 7 7 9 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.680
 9 8 sheikh the other minor for the six 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.550
 miners we will make this position there 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.800
 so that means you're like that 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.550
 to get your fingers up and sees 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.450
 remove the middle finger so no it's 7 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.119
 9 9 7 7 7 7 7d to vii too much but good 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.790
 this is the idea then rounds etc to the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.130
 same position as 5 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.659
 to have the minor so that we 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.229
 gives 5 7 7 5 5 and for the furrow goes 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.930
 see that where I play like that so with the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.140
 pain was coming through the floor bodies 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:10.679
 who gets back so like that so that's me 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 gives 5 5 7 7 5 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:19.170
 so the four chords and so that's it 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.370
 which will turn in a loop and I will 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.870
 explain right away the shore where more 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:31.800
 at the ethnic first on the agreements 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 crossed out so it's going to be these so 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.350
 that's what I do so we 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.989
 starts on the miners I gave a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.940
 blow on the bass so the first one where 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.260
 the first two as you want and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.620
 then I put a blow down on 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.940
 the treble and right after I raise the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.110
 pressure I'm doing on the ropes here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:03:07.829
 so alas I rise and I do that 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:09.299
 four times per accor so that's for 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.680
 this part with the bar and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.540
 we will move to other types of agreements 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.140
 which we can be overall the same 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.989
 rhythmic 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.140
 except that we will have to think about mutating 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.470
 the ropes here with the with the palm of 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.750
 the hand 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.360
 so you can put it on the ropes 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.680
 for a bit to mutate the dark and we 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.910
 will disable the tonic calves 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.910
 otherwise it will give 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.440
 you see that it sounds really 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.300
 much less well so if you are 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.130
 beginner in good it admits his suit 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.300
 but and it's quickly to move to 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.599
 bar agreements and that really makes a 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.040
 are more harmonious, and that's what 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.410
 so it's really that way there that 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.580
 who hangs to prevost but hey if you do not 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.099
 have not you can very well play 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.810
 like that and it will pass I compose 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.860
 now to bring down agreement for 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.569
 see what that gives I'm going to do 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.130
 only 13 barre chords such as 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.319
 I repeat this is really for me 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.209
 who are best in for this 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:31.460
 song especially with the rhythmic reggae 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:33.280
 here we go this video is over 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.220
