eight<00:04:06.430> or<00:04:06.640> nine<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.819> their<00:04:07.030> players<00:04:07.299> were

Cup started so the administrators have

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:14.910

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.620 
to take a look at the planning they've

when he's contracts due to expire but

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.529 
when he's contracts due to expire but
it's<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:30.130> big<00:04:30.310> ask<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.759> I<00:04:30.820> think<00:04:31.030> he'd<00:04:31.180> love<00:04:31.389> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
that football is such a fickle Beast we

do you see Captain Marvel staying on the
I<00:04:44.680> think<00:04:44.979> he<00:04:45.160> would<00:04:45.340> I<00:04:45.580> I<00:04:46.449> don't<00:04:46.810> know<00:04:46.960> him

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
I think he would I I don't know him

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.689 
I think he would I I don't know him
personally<00:04:47.139> but<00:04:47.560> I<00:04:47.620> would<00:04:47.919> expect<00:04:48.009> he'd<00:04:48.460> like

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
personally but I would expect he'd like

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.540 
personally but I would expect he'd like
the<00:04:49.000> opportunity<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:50.259> get<00:04:50.710> Thailand<00:04:51.160> back<00:04:51.370> up

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
the opportunity to get Thailand back up

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.129 
the opportunity to get Thailand back up
the<00:04:51.699> top<00:04:51.880> where<00:04:52.060> they<00:04:52.180> belong<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:52.720> I<00:04:52.750> think<00:04:52.990> he

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
the top where they belong and I think he

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.080 
the top where they belong and I think he
would<00:04:53.320> relish<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.979> opportunity<00:04:54.039> just<00:04:54.940> a

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
would relish the opportunity just a

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
would relish the opportunity just a
matter<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.330> whether<00:04:55.479> he's<00:04:55.660> going<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.900> get<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
matter of whether he's going to get the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.170 
matter of whether he's going to get the
opportunity<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.710> do<00:04:56.919> that<00:04:57.099> he<00:04:57.759> may<00:04:57.940> get<00:04:58.120> the

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
opportunity to do that he may get the

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.469 
opportunity to do that he may get the
opportunity<00:04:58.770> because<00:04:59.770> of<00:05:00.009> who<00:05:00.520> he<00:05:00.639> is<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:01.210> if

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
opportunity because of who he is and if

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.749 
opportunity because of who he is and if
it<00:05:01.599> was<00:05:01.750> another<00:05:02.650> coach<00:05:02.919> maybe<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.280> local<00:05:03.460> coach

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
it was another coach maybe a local coach

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.610 
it was another coach maybe a local coach
I'm<00:05:03.970> sure<00:05:04.150> he'd<00:05:04.389> be<00:05:04.479> out<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:04.900> maybe<00:05:05.110> he<00:05:05.590> might

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
I'm sure he'd be out that maybe he might

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.920 
I'm sure he'd be out that maybe he might
