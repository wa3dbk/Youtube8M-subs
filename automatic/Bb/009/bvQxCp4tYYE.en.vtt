stretch<00:00:28.609> going<00:00:28.880> forward<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.900> muscle<00:00:30.289> can

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
stretch going forward this muscle can

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.979 
stretch going forward this muscle can
get<00:00:30.529> quite<00:00:30.830> restricted<00:00:31.460> I'll<00:00:32.210> examine<00:00:32.570> people

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
get quite restricted I'll examine people

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.060 
get quite restricted I'll examine people
and<00:00:33.079> I'll<00:00:33.170> see<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.379> they<00:00:33.530> have<00:00:33.680> restrictions

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
and I'll see that they have restrictions

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.340 
and I'll see that they have restrictions
in<00:00:34.399> external<00:00:35.120> rotation<00:00:35.390> they<00:00:35.930> try<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.200> bring

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
in external rotation they try and bring

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.350 
in external rotation they try and bring
the<00:00:36.440> arm<00:00:36.620> back<00:00:36.710> quite<00:00:37.640> often<00:00:37.820> their<00:00:38.120> pecs

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
the arm back quite often their pecs

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.670 
the arm back quite often their pecs
really<00:00:38.720> tight<00:00:38.930> but<00:00:39.170> don't<00:00:39.260> look<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.559> always

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
really tight but don't look it always

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.950 
really tight but don't look it always
gets<00:00:39.950> missed<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:41.059> little<00:00:41.600> one<00:00:41.780> right

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
gets missed is this little one right

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.959 
gets missed is this little one right
underneath<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.350> clavicle<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> cochlea

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
underneath the clavicle so the cochlea

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.410 
underneath the clavicle so the cochlea
is<00:00:44.120> okay<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:45.860> we<00:00:46.160> look<00:00:46.280> at<00:00:46.399> atomically<00:00:46.940> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
is okay so we look at atomically and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.389 
is okay so we look at atomically and
Mickey's<00:00:47.719> collarbone<00:00:48.230> here<00:00:48.469> we'll<00:00:49.160> see<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
Mickey's collarbone here we'll see that

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.690 
Mickey's collarbone here we'll see that
just<00:00:50.090> underneath<00:00:50.690> here<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:51.829> close<00:00:52.100> now

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
just underneath here just so close now

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.350 
just underneath here just so close now
tender<00:00:53.390> right<00:00:53.540> there<00:00:54.010> okay<00:00:55.039> very<00:00:55.789> common<00:00:56.149> area

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
tender right there okay very common area

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.510 
tender right there okay very common area
so<00:00:57.110> I've<00:00:57.530> got<00:00:57.680> two<00:00:57.800> balls<00:00:58.010> in<00:00:58.129> my<00:00:58.190> hand<00:00:58.219> here

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
so I've got two balls in my hand here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.750 
so I've got two balls in my hand here
now<00:00:59.300> for<00:00:59.809> men<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:00.320> probably<00:01:00.680> easier<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.460> use

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
now for men it's probably easier to use

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.790 
now for men it's probably easier to use
the<00:01:02.239> tennis<00:01:02.570> ball<00:01:02.750> because<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:03.590> can<00:01:03.710> get

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
the tennis ball because you can get

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.049 
the tennis ball because you can get
underneath<00:01:04.129> there<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:04.549> if<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.759> want<00:01:04.789> to<00:01:04.969> a

Makayla<00:01:28.939> won't<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.149> compare<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.659> with<00:01:29.719> a

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
Makayla won't you compare this with a

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.289 
Makayla won't you compare this with a
softball<00:01:30.529> excuse<00:01:31.429> me<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.639> tennis<00:01:31.909> ball<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.399 

alright<00:01:37.249> so<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.389> a<00:01:38.479> lot<00:01:38.719> easier<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:39.169> get<00:01:39.259> in

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
alright so it's a lot easier to get in

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.050 
alright so it's a lot easier to get in
there<00:01:39.560> with<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.950> softball<00:01:40.429> yeah<00:01:40.909> that's

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
there with the softball yeah that's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.809 
there with the softball yeah that's
because<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.419> diameter<00:01:41.929> and<00:01:42.319> if<00:01:42.819> slippery

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
because of the diameter and if slippery

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.949 
because of the diameter and if slippery
almost<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.509> it's<00:01:44.840> it's<00:01:45.739> not<00:01:45.859> quite<00:01:46.069> as<00:01:46.130> yeah

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
almost and it's it's not quite as yeah

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.300 
almost and it's it's not quite as yeah
try<00:01:47.959> again<00:01:48.229> get<00:01:48.469> on<00:01:48.590> there<00:01:48.770> with<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:48.919> softball

rolling<00:01:50.090> back<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.299> forth<00:01:51.639> this<00:01:52.639> is<00:01:52.759> a<00:01:52.789> really

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
rolling back and forth this is a really

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.809 
rolling back and forth this is a really
effective<00:01:53.659> way<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.079> release<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:55.069> subclavius

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
effective way to release the subclavius

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.370 
effective way to release the subclavius
you<00:01:55.969> just<00:01:56.119> want<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.299> make<00:01:56.419> sure<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:59.289> when<00:02:00.289> you
