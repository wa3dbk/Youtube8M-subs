00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.630 
with this frame in there and then start
with<00:01:56.880> filling<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.450> post<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:58.310> your<00:01:59.310> longer

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
with filling your post down your longer

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.999 
with filling your post down your longer
folks<00:01:59.850> will<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.869> then<00:02:01.649> your<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
folks will go down and then your and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.080 
folks will go down and then your and
then<00:02:02.100> you'll<00:02:02.219> attach<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> middle<00:02:02.729> longer

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
then you'll attach the middle longer

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
then you'll attach the middle longer
close<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> by<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.280> probably

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
close to that and by then you probably

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.300 
close to that and by then you probably
want<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> lay<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.000> its<00:02:06.030> back<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
want to lay it on its back but you can

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.010 
want to lay it on its back but you can
unzip<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.940> whole<00:02:09.119> bottom<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> start<00:02:09.869> feeling

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
unzip this whole bottom to start feeling

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.970 
unzip this whole bottom to start feeling
it<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.379> way<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:11.700> whole<00:02:11.910> bottom<00:02:12.209> here

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
it that way this whole bottom here

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.820 
it that way this whole bottom here
zipper<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.900> he<00:02:14.900> goes<00:02:15.050> all<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.440> way<00:02:15.620> around

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
zipper on it he goes all the way around

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.339 
zipper on it he goes all the way around
there<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.879> all<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.390> that's<00:02:17.959> how<00:02:18.140> you'd

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
there it's all about it that's how you'd

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.289 
there it's all about it that's how you'd
unzip<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.980> bottom<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:20.030> that's<00:02:20.150> what

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
unzip the bottom of it and that's what

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.789 
unzip the bottom of it and that's what
you<00:02:20.420> want<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.599> do<00:02:20.659> to<00:02:20.720> start<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.200> then<00:02:21.290> flip<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
you want to do to start and then flip it

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.140 
you want to do to start and then flip it
upside<00:02:22.099> down<00:02:22.129> and<00:02:22.340> start<00:02:22.670> building<00:02:22.819> from<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
upside down and start building from the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.350 
upside down and start building from the
top<00:02:23.360> up<00:02:23.569> or<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.260> top<00:02:24.440> down<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:24.830> sorry

top up or the top down I'm sorry
so<00:02:26.360> once<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.599> get<00:02:26.690> these<00:02:26.780> long<00:02:26.989> poles<00:02:27.260> on

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
so once you get these long poles on

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.390 
so once you get these long poles on
you'll<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.709> these<00:02:27.799> you<00:02:28.129> got<00:02:28.250> these

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you'll see these you got these

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.160 
you'll see these you got these
t-connectors<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.720> that's<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.080> way

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
t-connectors here and that's the way

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.119 
t-connectors here and that's the way
that's<00:02:30.349> gonna<00:02:30.500> work<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.069> be

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
that's gonna work this can be

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.130 
that's gonna work this can be
t-connector<00:02:31.879> there<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.299> then<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.900> bar<00:02:33.110> that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
t-connector there and then a bar that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.020 
t-connector there and then a bar that
goes<00:02:33.379> across<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.040> back<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.790> your<00:02:34.940> other

goes across in the back and your other

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.240 
goes across in the back and your other
t-connector<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.590> front<00:02:36.860> parts<00:02:37.069> gonna

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
t-connector and the front parts gonna

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.819 
t-connector and the front parts gonna
have<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.430> same<00:02:37.580> thing<00:02:37.640> at<00:02:38.150> t-connector<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
have the same thing at t-connector the

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.259 
have the same thing at t-connector the
bar<00:02:40.099> that<00:02:40.250> goes<00:02:40.310> across<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:44.120> another

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
bar that goes across and then another

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.309 
bar that goes across and then another
t-connector<00:02:44.959> here

t-connector here

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.960 
t-connector here
and<00:02:45.799> then<00:02:45.920> you'll<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.099> these<00:02:46.250> short<00:02:46.549> posts

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and then you'll have these short posts

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.809 
and then you'll have these short posts
here<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.579> short<00:02:50.510> post<00:02:50.690> each<00:02:50.930> each<00:02:51.670> one<00:02:52.670> at

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
here and a short post each each one at

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.270 
here and a short post each each one at
the<00:02:52.910> bottom<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.450> each<00:02:53.540> t-connector<00:02:54.260> all<00:02:54.890> four

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
the bottom of each t-connector all four

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.949 
the bottom of each t-connector all four
of<00:02:55.310> them<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:56.060> then<00:02:56.150> you'll<00:02:56.299> start<00:02:56.720> then

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
of them and then you'll start then

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.180 
of them and then you'll start then
you'll<00:02:57.109> build<00:02:57.290> your<00:02:57.379> bottom<00:02:57.739> with<00:02:57.829> these<00:02:57.980> um

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
you'll build your bottom with these um

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.400 
you'll build your bottom with these um
corner<00:02:58.849> pieces<00:02:59.060> just<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.989> did<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.200> top

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
corner pieces just like you did the top

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.729 
corner pieces just like you did the top
in<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.799> number<00:03:01.010> one<00:03:01.780> post<00:03:02.780> between<00:03:03.260> it

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
in the number one post between it

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.729 
in the number one post between it
I<00:03:03.769> think<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.340> pumps<00:03:04.609> here<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:06.260> posts<00:03:06.590> for

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
I think the pumps here the posts for

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.170 
I think the pumps here the posts for
this<00:03:06.859> one<00:03:07.040> for<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.250> t<00:03:07.400> connectors<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:07.970> number

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
this one for the t connectors and number

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.150 
this one for the t connectors and number
seven<00:03:08.510> you'll<00:03:08.629> get<00:03:08.780> two<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.019> these<00:03:09.260> and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
seven you'll get two of these and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.589 
seven you'll get two of these and
they're<00:03:10.670> basically<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.120> same<00:03:11.150> thing<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
they're basically the same thing as the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.119 
they're basically the same thing as the
ones<00:03:11.840> are<00:03:12.019> just<00:03:12.170> slightly<00:03:12.470> longer<00:03:12.799> because

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
ones are just slightly longer because

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.890 
ones are just slightly longer because
the<00:03:13.280> they<00:03:13.970> tend<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.299> go<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.599> here<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> little

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
the they tend to go in here a little

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.390 
the they tend to go in here a little
further<00:03:15.049> than<00:03:15.500> these<00:03:15.680> go<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.010> here<00:03:16.190> they<00:03:16.280> only

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
further than these go in here they only

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.830 
further than these go in here they only
go<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.640> Tibet<00:03:16.879> right<00:03:17.030> there<00:03:17.239> where<00:03:17.540> these<00:03:17.660> go

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
go in Tibet right there where these go

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.089 
go in Tibet right there where these go
further<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.319> they<00:03:18.440> need<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> be<00:03:18.709> slightly

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
further and so they need to be slightly

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.190 
further and so they need to be slightly
longer<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.720> know<00:03:20.780> which<00:03:20.930> ones<00:03:21.139> to

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
longer just so you know which ones to

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.650 
longer just so you know which ones to
use<00:03:21.380> for<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:23.000> that's<00:03:23.090> basically<00:03:23.480> it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
use for that and that's basically it

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.879 
use for that and that's basically it
you're<00:03:23.900> going<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.109> build<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.349> upside<00:03:24.650> down<00:03:24.680> and

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
you're going to build it upside down and

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.770 
you're going to build it upside down and
when<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.280> starts<00:03:25.609> getting<00:03:25.730> real<00:03:25.970> tall<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.359> lay

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
when it starts getting real tall you lay

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.150 
when it starts getting real tall you lay
it<00:03:26.840> on<00:03:26.959> its<00:03:26.989> back<00:03:27.169> so<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.650> can<00:03:27.799> finish<00:03:27.950> this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
it on its back so you can finish this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.229 
it on its back so you can finish this
bottom<00:03:28.519> part<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.030> then<00:03:29.480> zip<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.810> all<00:03:29.930> up

and you just do that on all four okay
make<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.420> video<00:05:09.720> quicker<00:05:09.990> I'm<00:05:10.140> not<00:05:10.290> gonna<00:05:10.440> do

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.930 
get it squared away the way you want it
in<00:05:18.510> there<00:05:18.750> okay<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.410> once<00:05:19.650> that's<00:05:20.280> done<00:05:20.490> we'll

in there okay and once that's done we'll

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.390 
in there okay and once that's done we'll
take<00:05:21.000> this<00:05:21.330> one<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:22.380> do<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.830> same<00:05:22.860> thing<00:05:23.250> but

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
take this one and do the same thing but

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.460 
take this one and do the same thing but
the<00:05:23.520> other<00:05:23.550> way<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:24.720> have<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:24.990> reflective

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
the other way you have the reflective

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.600 
the other way you have the reflective
material<00:05:25.830> up<00:05:26.630> again<00:05:27.630> you'll<00:05:28.190> do<00:05:29.190> all<00:05:29.340> four

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
material up again you'll do all four

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.380 
material up again you'll do all four
corners<00:05:29.910> it's<00:05:30.590> get<00:05:31.590> them<00:05:31.910> velcro<00:05:32.910> these

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390
