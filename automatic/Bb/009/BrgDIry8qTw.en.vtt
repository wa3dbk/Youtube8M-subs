00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.110 

yes<00:03:09.640> $10<00:03:10.270> possum<00:03:10.810> owners<00:03:11.050> of<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.730> okay<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:12.970> are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
yes $10 possum owners of it okay we are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360 
yes $10 possum owners of it okay we are
downloading<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.900> required<00:03:13.930> files<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:15.220> the

system<00:03:15.760> needs<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:20.520> so<00:03:21.520> I<00:03:21.610> reckon<00:03:22.030> once<00:03:22.270> this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
system needs and so I reckon once this

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.290 
system needs and so I reckon once this
part<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.140> completed<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.340> one<00:03:24.489> thing<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.880> didn't

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
part is completed the one thing I didn't

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.690 
part is completed the one thing I didn't
do<00:03:25.480> first<00:03:25.930> which<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.410> should<00:03:26.650> have<00:03:26.680> done<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.310> I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
do first which I should have done and I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.160 
do first which I should have done and I
wouldn't<00:03:27.970> be<00:03:28.060> putting<00:03:28.270> up<00:03:28.480> with<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.780> as<00:03:29.020> I

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
wouldn't be putting up with this as I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.880 
wouldn't be putting up with this as I
did<00:03:29.380> not<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.950> Windows<00:03:30.310> Update<00:03:30.730> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the next thing that I do I sort of kind

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.870 
the next thing that I do I sort of kind
of<00:03:37.750> jumped<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.080> gun<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.319> this<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.819> as<00:03:39.819> I

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
of jumped the gun on this one as I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.550

wanted to get this one out before I
actually<00:03:41.709> went<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:42.190> bed<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.810> that's<00:03:43.810> reason

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
actually went to bed so that's reason

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.110 
actually went to bed so that's reason
why<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.800> taken<00:03:45.340> just<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.550> little<00:03:45.760> bit<00:03:45.910> longer

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
why it's taken just a little bit longer

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.870 
why it's taken just a little bit longer
and<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:47.410> make<00:03:47.709> sure<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.190> jump<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.670> to

let's<00:04:16.660> go<00:04:16.810> ahead<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.019> close<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:19.030> that's

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
let's go ahead and close this so that's

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.630 
let's go ahead and close this so that's
close<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.049> now<00:04:20.289> let's<00:04:20.620> go<00:04:21.010> ahead<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.370> close

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
close so now let's go ahead and close

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.010 
close so now let's go ahead and close
out<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.910> here<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.740> then<00:04:24.310> let's<00:04:25.030> figure<00:04:25.660> out

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
out of here and then let's figure out

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.719 
out of here and then let's figure out
how<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.410> actually<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> don't

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
how to actually get to it so I don't

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.100 
how to actually get to it so I don't
think<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:32.650> get<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.280> yeah<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.669> we<00:04:33.760> go

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
think I can get to it yeah here we go

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.690 
think I can get to it yeah here we go
alright<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.390> do<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.140> was<00:04:38.700> jump

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
alright so what you do is that was jump

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.370 
alright so what you do is that was jump
back<00:04:39.880> over<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.210> desktop<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.990> run<00:04:41.200> your

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
back over to the desktop you run your

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.950 
back over to the desktop you run your
cursor<00:04:41.560> down<00:04:41.830> here<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.240> brings<00:04:43.450> up<00:04:43.750> in

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960

let's<00:05:03.379> see<00:05:03.559> how<00:05:03.739> different<00:05:04.069> it<00:05:04.339> is<00:05:04.520> from<00:05:04.669> is

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
let's see how different it is from is
