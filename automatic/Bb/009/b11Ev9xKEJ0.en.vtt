00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.270
 this sky is real 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.540
 just like a telescope they won't bring 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.540
 harm 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.930
 wait mi soo demon he's adjusting 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.930
 the first time is always difficult 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.660
 didn't sit enough need to pull it out 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.180
 ok we will try you 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.160
 i say what to inquire about flying it 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 I wanted to save your life, you visited me 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.950
 stuffed into this thing you did to me 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.470
 you have on this world not mi su 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.790
 losing information I broke the hell up 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.890
 what did you want to learn to mix 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.970
 martini we know who would 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.790
 and so what you need to do from you 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.009
 what do you say everything else will do 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.420
 they will then be free where 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.490
 You and inside Janus that this device 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.979
 creating three-dimensional space from 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.770
 genetic memory is a room 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.509
 are needed 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.360
 but when we try to open it your 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.000
 mind protests you are not able to step 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 his ancestor's business is exactly what happened 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.979
 before you kicked out of the desired area 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.060
 memory in a more stable state 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.060
 I load the training program 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.150
 attention under the data is unstable 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.150
 sync recovery 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.910
 welcome object 17 this same training 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.110
 will allow you to get acquainted with the system 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.970
 Animus controls follow the specified 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.400
 sync shows how much your 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.820
 actions coincide with you tech your 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.560
 ancestor if you sync once they 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.120
 the brain will bring you back to the last 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.290
 synchronized point 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.060
 now you are dangerously close rat chronization 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.090
 follow directions to fix 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.090
 position 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.810
 animus uses puppet concept 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.030
 to manage your ancestors upload 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.560
 procedure to adapt your body to minus 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.020
 consider the default actions for 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.280
 control button chapter systems for 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.280
 inspection of the environment 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.050
 OK 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.190
 perfectly 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.459
 animus distinguish two main modes 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.280
 high and low racks 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.120
 low rack operations 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.709
 socially acceptable 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.709
 a high more aggressively and well 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.780
 we will continue the sync by running 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.430
 multiple action high rack 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.430
 grab and don't ask this man 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.430
 OK 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.100
 the leg button in the high rack allows 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.920
 you use three 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.430
 he helps to escape from the soldiers or 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.980
 catch up 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.730
 running away all not face 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.900
 by passersby 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.900
 otherwise you might lose 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:22.610
 perfectly select the hidden block 1 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:33.080
 blade go to the soldier and kill him 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:35.949
 pressing the button of an armed hand saw 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.949
 things happened
