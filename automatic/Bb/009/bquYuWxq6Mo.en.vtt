00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.849 
versus of Condoleezza right but when I
could<00:00:02.280> reverse<00:00:02.610> him<00:00:03.030> he<00:00:03.810> basically<00:00:04.020> said<00:00:04.680> I'm

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
could reverse him he basically said I'm

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.610 
could reverse him he basically said I'm

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
guessing and then he made a reference to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.970 
guessing and then he made a reference to
their<00:00:08.250> leaving<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.820> May<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.740> I<00:00:10.740> knew<00:00:10.950> then

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
their leaving in May and I knew then

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.940 
their leaving in May and I knew then
that<00:00:11.309> when<00:00:11.730> he<00:00:11.880> said<00:00:12.059> twice<00:00:12.300> i'm<00:00:12.570> guessing<00:00:13.049> he

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
that when he said twice i'm guessing he

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.930 
that when he said twice i'm guessing he
was<00:00:14.280> trying<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.730> fit<00:00:15.690> an<00:00:15.929> interdimensional

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
was trying to fit an interdimensional

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.859 
was trying to fit an interdimensional
thing<00:00:17.940> into<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> 3d<00:00:19.320> paradigm<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.340> ship<00:00:21.119> he

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
thing into a 3d paradigm a ship he

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.330 
thing into a 3d paradigm a ship he
wouldn't<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.590> reptilians<00:00:23.220> were

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
wouldn't know that the reptilians were

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
wouldn't know that the reptilians were
leaving<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> big<00:00:24.060> ship<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.289> he<00:00:25.380> hears

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
leaving on a big ship so when he hears

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.259 
leaving on a big ship so when he hears
ship<00:00:25.890> he's<00:00:26.130> thinking<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.820> ship<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
ship he's thinking it was ship in the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.570 
ship he's thinking it was ship in the
harbor<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.260> he<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.590> putting<00:00:29.099> two<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.400> two

harbor and he was putting two and two

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.250 
harbor and he was putting two and two
together<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.000> mean<00:00:30.240> he<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.750> trying<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
together I mean he was really trying to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.090 
together I mean he was really trying to
get<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:32.160> stuff<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.850> he<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.840> guessing

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
get the good stuff but he was guessing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.180 
get the good stuff but he was guessing

reading Ike if you have read him or

reading Ike if you have read him or
speaking<00:02:16.570> with<00:02:16.840> him<00:02:16.960> how<00:02:17.140> has<00:02:17.290> he<00:02:17.410> influenced

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you I couldn't read David for quite a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.220 
you I couldn't read David for quite a
while<00:02:21.210> just<00:02:22.210> couldn't<00:02:22.540> get<00:02:22.630> through<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:23.020> um

while just couldn't get through it um
and<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.390> he's<00:02:25.600> probably<00:02:25.780> more

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
and I do think he's probably more

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.290 
and I do think he's probably more
accurate<00:02:26.440> in<00:02:27.250> his<00:02:28.620> take<00:02:29.620> on<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:31.150> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.630 
societies and all that very very
accurate<00:02:36.970> he's<00:02:37.720> very<00:02:37.840> congruent<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:39.040> reverse

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640

programs<00:04:20.160> brought<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.030> by<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.360> earth<00:04:21.810> which

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
programs brought on by the earth which

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.580 
programs brought on by the earth which
felt<00:04:22.770> itself<00:04:23.280> cut<00:04:24.150> off<00:04:24.360> from<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.900> source<00:04:25.200> and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
felt itself cut off from the source and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.720 
felt itself cut off from the source and
that's<00:04:26.280> all<00:04:26.520> wrong<00:04:26.700> he's<00:04:27.420> got<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.930> know<00:04:28.730> up

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
that's all wrong he's got you know up

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.580 
that's all wrong he's got you know up
until<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.210> ayahuasca<00:04:30.540> tea<00:04:30.960> he<00:04:31.260> was<00:04:31.380> doing

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
until the ayahuasca tea he was doing

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.060 
until the ayahuasca tea he was doing
great<00:04:32.120> yes<00:04:33.120> we're<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.390> holographic<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.970> i

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
great yes we're all holographic but i

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.270 
great yes we're all holographic but i
can't<00:04:38.070> comment<00:04:38.310> too<00:04:38.610> much<00:04:38.790> on<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.150> uh<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.890> he

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
can't comment too much on that uh but he

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.900 
can't comment too much on that uh but he
is<00:04:41.610> he's<00:04:42.420> off<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:43.080> some<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.560> his<00:04:43.710> key<00:04:44.190> things<00:04:44.550> as

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
is he's off on some of his key things as

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.420 
is he's off on some of his key things as
far<00:04:45.060> as<00:04:45.210> I'm<00:04:45.330> concerned<00:04:45.800> now<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:46.860> also<00:04:47.130> have<00:04:47.400> a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
far as I'm concerned now you also have a

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.000 
far as I'm concerned now you also have a
problem<00:04:47.910> with<00:04:48.060> channeling<00:04:48.900> now<00:04:49.140> having<00:04:49.860> done

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
problem with channeling now having done

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.930 
problem with channeling now having done
all<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.370> research<00:04:50.670> where<00:04:51.330> before<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.350> a

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
all this research where before you you a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.820 
all this research where before you you a
lot<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.180> channel<00:04:54.570> information<00:04:55.050> you<00:04:55.620> took

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
lot of that channel information you took

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.160 
lot of that channel information you took
to<00:04:55.980> heart
