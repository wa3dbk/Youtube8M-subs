00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.350

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.620
 face is the following first of all not 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.690
 starting here, it 's ok I never played this 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.780
 version, which is the only version I 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.800
 I played the first one in the forest. 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.050
 Where do you have a flashlight you have? 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.420
 to find another eight pages and everything 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.210
 but it's just the next guy I do not 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.940
 I had the courage to finish the game 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.720
 so that until the slayer finds himself 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.259
 face 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.030
 laender and finally great courage 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.840
 so let's go here and talk now 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.720
 arrives at the first page one thing that I 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 I have to tell you the following 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.009
 that version here I did not play in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.090
 other actions like I said I just watch 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.820
 in other channels 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.060
 The guys playing and everything else I believe 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.550
 that this version be of all the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.770
 second, even more scary than 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 I found I did not like the blue layout 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.000
 in the first one and this one here then how 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.380
 and we run the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.840
 My goodness 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.430
 the only thing I know, face of loot 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.549
 I have no practice playing this game. 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.040
 more is that you can not look too much 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.130
 back can not run too much 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.110
 because the song, the song, the girl, I do not know 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.060
 what 's in that version here 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.380
 But, come on, let's face it, let's go. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.980
