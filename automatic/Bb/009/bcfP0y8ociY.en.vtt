once I'm done I equal with 2.40 what

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.540 
once I'm done I equal with 2.40 what
this<00:00:54.660> means<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> countersteer<00:00:55.649> world<00:00:55.829> for

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this means in the countersteer world for

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.220 
this means in the countersteer world for
every<00:00:56.790> one<00:00:57.000> rotation<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> front<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.899> making

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
every one rotation the front is making

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
every one rotation the front is making
the<00:00:58.350> readers<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.920> point<00:00:59.370> 40

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the readers going to go to point 40

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.530 
the readers going to go to point 40
times<00:01:00.059> faster<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:02.030> what<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.329> means

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
times faster so what that really means

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.050 
times faster so what that really means
is<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.619> value<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:05.069> final<00:01:05.459> counter<00:01:05.909> sir

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is I think my value my final counter sir

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
is I think my value my final counter sir
value<00:01:06.329> the<00:01:06.450> two<00:01:06.630> point<00:01:06.869> forty<00:01:07.200> subtract<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
value the two point forty subtract the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.550 
value the two point forty subtract the
one<00:01:08.429> drop<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> decimal<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.289> hundred

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
one drop the decimal you get one hundred

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
one drop the decimal you get one hundred
forty<00:01:10.859> percent<00:01:11.039> another<00:01:11.999> example<00:01:12.509> of<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
forty percent another example of that is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.169 
forty percent another example of that is
let's<00:01:13.590> say<00:01:13.709> your<00:01:13.859> final<00:01:13.979> value<00:01:14.429> is<00:01:14.459> two<00:01:14.969> point

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
let's say your final value is two point

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.779 
let's say your final value is two point
twenty<00:01:15.299> drop<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> drop<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.709> by<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.039> get<00:01:17.670> rid

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
twenty drop the drop it by one get rid

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.760 
twenty drop the drop it by one get rid
of<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> decimal<00:01:18.329> you<00:01:18.389> got<00:01:18.509> hundred<00:01:18.810> twenty<00:01:19.109> so

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
of the decimal you got hundred twenty so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.249 
of the decimal you got hundred twenty so
that<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.130> becomes<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.490> 100<00:01:20.969> 100<00:01:21.299> percent<00:01:21.600> one

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that two becomes a 100 100 percent one

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.019 
that two becomes a 100 100 percent one
point<00:01:22.469> nine<00:01:22.590> five<00:01:22.740> becomes<00:01:23.100> 95<00:01:23.700> percent

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:24.029 
point nine five becomes 95 percent

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:28.879 
point nine five becomes 95 percent

divided<00:03:08.680> by<00:03:08.829> C<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:10.239> on<00:03:10.569> one<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.870> old<00:03:11.069> kits<00:03:12.069> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
divided by C so on one of my old kits I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.689 
divided by C so on one of my old kits I
had<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.519> 36<00:03:12.909> pulley<00:03:13.449> 16<00:03:14.049> 16<00:03:14.560> 18<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.370> gonna<00:03:15.489> plug

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:15.699 
had a 36 pulley 16 16 18 you gonna plug

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:17.610 
had a 36 pulley 16 16 18 you gonna plug
it<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.849> numbers<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.419> math<00:03:16.599> drop<00:03:17.379> down

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
it in numbers and do the math drop down

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.649 
it in numbers and do the math drop down
do<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.949> math<00:03:18.159> drop<00:03:18.430> down<00:03:18.669> I<00:03:18.909> ended<00:03:19.359> up<00:03:19.449> with<00:03:19.629> a

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
do the math drop down I ended up with a

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.670 
do the math drop down I ended up with a
value<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.049> 2.0<00:03:20.739> meaning<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:23.319> every<00:03:23.530> one

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
value of 2.0 meaning for every one

rotation<00:03:23.979> in<00:03:24.189> the<00:03:24.280> front<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.699> back<00:03:24.729> was

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
rotation in the front the back was

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
rotation in the front the back was
spending<00:03:25.299> two<00:03:25.509> times<00:03:25.750> faster<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:27.129> I<00:03:27.159> said

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
spending two times faster so like I said

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.460 
spending two times faster so like I said
before<00:03:27.370> two<00:03:28.180> dropped<00:03:28.540> by<00:03:28.720> one<00:03:28.959> get<00:03:29.199> rid<00:03:29.259> of<00:03:29.379> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
before two dropped by one get rid of the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.490 
before two dropped by one get rid of the
decimal<00:03:29.919> so<00:03:30.009> I<00:03:30.099> was<00:03:30.189> 100%<00:03:30.519> counter-steer<00:03:31.500> also

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
decimal so I was 100% counter-steer also

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.129 
decimal so I was 100% counter-steer also
