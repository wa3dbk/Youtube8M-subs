00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
right so we've gotten to the point where

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.070 
right so we've gotten to the point where
we<00:00:15.640> have<00:00:15.670> really<00:00:16.119> big<00:00:16.269> thumbnails<00:00:16.750> here<00:00:16.900> in

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
the media library and sometimes even

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.450 
the media library and sometimes even
though<00:00:20.710> you've<00:00:20.859> got<00:00:20.890> these<00:00:21.099> nice<00:00:21.249> big

though you've got these nice big
thumbnails<00:00:21.849> here<00:00:21.939> that's<00:00:22.659> not<00:00:22.869> enough<00:00:22.989> what

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
thumbnails here that's not enough what

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.649 
thumbnails here that's not enough what
you<00:00:23.769> really<00:00:23.919> need<00:00:24.009> to<00:00:24.159> be<00:00:24.310> able<00:00:24.400> to<00:00:24.550> do<00:00:24.699> is<00:00:25.119> to

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
you really need to be able to do is to

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.559 
you really need to be able to do is to
be<00:00:25.749> able<00:00:25.839> to<00:00:25.989> look<00:00:26.169> at<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.800> videos<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:28.089> a<00:00:28.390> much
