an<00:00:34.440> SD<00:00:34.590> card<00:00:34.850> I've<00:00:35.850> tested<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
an SD card I've tested it with the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
an SD card I've tested it with the
wireless<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.079> off<00:00:37.260> I've<00:00:37.620> tested<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> with

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
wireless on and off I've tested it with

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
wireless on and off I've tested it with
the<00:00:38.520> 3d<00:00:38.879> slider<00:00:39.149> on/off<00:00:39.719> volume<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.680> off

the 3d slider on/off volume on and off

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.979 
the 3d slider on/off volume on and off
and<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.399> pretty<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.510> my<00:00:42.540> options

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and that's pretty much all of my options

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
and that's pretty much all of my options
so<00:00:43.770> I'll<00:00:44.250> show<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.879> does<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
so I'll show you what it does and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
so I'll show you what it does and
hopefully<00:00:45.750> somebody<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.530> what's<00:00:46.980> up

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
hopefully somebody will know what's up

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.590 
hopefully somebody will know what's up
and<00:00:47.399> maybe<00:00:47.550> there'll<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.789> some<00:00:48.000> magic<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and maybe there'll be some magic I can

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.310 
and maybe there'll be some magic I can
do<00:00:48.780> internally<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.739> even<00:00:50.870> externally<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.020> even

do internally or even externally or even
internally<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.860> willing<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> apart

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
internally I'm willing to take it apart

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
internally I'm willing to take it apart

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
is what happens you got the DES it is

light will come on and it's going to be

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
light will come on and it's going to be
hard<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
screens so that is it's kicking out

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
screens so that is it's kicking out
light<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.180> knows<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.840> trying<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> turn<00:01:22.439> on

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619

light and knows it's trying to turn on
I've<00:01:23.490> gotten<00:01:23.909> no<00:01:24.150> activity<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> 3d<00:01:25.409> area

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
I've gotten no activity on the 3d area

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
I've gotten no activity on the 3d area
that<00:01:25.890> hasn't<00:01:26.070> lit<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> blue<00:01:27.630> light

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that hasn't lit up I've got a blue light

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.219 
that hasn't lit up I've got a blue light
here<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.430> wireless<00:01:30.030> light<00:01:30.900> here

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
here and we have a wireless light here

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.620 
here and we have a wireless light here
so<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.650> wireless<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> turned<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:33.180> far<00:01:33.570> as

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so the wireless is turned on as far as

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.170 
so the wireless is turned on as far as
we<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.960> tell<00:01:34.079> right<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:35.820> sit<00:01:36.000> here

requested an IP address so this thing's

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.479 
requested an IP address so this thing's
on<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.269> network<00:04:16.660> it's<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.470> not<00:04:17.680> stuck<00:04:18.250> it

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
on the network it's just not stuck it

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.400 
on the network it's just not stuck it
just<00:04:18.699> won't<00:04:18.850> load<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.299> home<00:04:19.419> menu<00:04:19.859> so

just won't load the home menu so

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.540 
just won't load the home menu so
interestingly<00:04:23.410> enough<00:04:23.860> when<00:04:24.009> I<00:04:24.039> noticed<00:04:24.400> that

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
interestingly enough when I noticed that

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.430 
interestingly enough when I noticed that
I<00:04:24.580> was<00:04:24.699> like<00:04:24.880> maybe<00:04:25.509> I'll<00:04:25.690> leave<00:04:25.840> it<00:04:25.990> like<00:04:26.229> up

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
I was like maybe I'll leave it like up

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.680 
I was like maybe I'll leave it like up
for<00:04:26.740> like<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> while<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.880> see<00:04:28.120> maybe<00:04:28.330> it'll

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
for like a while and see maybe it'll

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
for like a while and see maybe it'll
grab<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> update<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.800> install<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.220> update

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
grab a update and install the update

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.730 
grab a update and install the update
maybe<00:04:31.330> I'll<00:04:31.419> get<00:04:31.509> lucky<00:04:31.570> but<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.350> never<00:04:32.560> did

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
maybe I'll get lucky but it never did

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.740 
maybe I'll get lucky but it never did
and<00:04:33.009> again<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.610> been<00:04:33.759> like<00:04:34.030> three<00:04:34.360> months<00:04:34.630> or

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
and again it's been like three months or

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.090 
and again it's been like three months or
something<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.229> don't<00:04:35.470> think<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:35.770> have<00:04:35.889> any<00:04:36.070> hope

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
something I don't think I have any hope

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.430 
something I don't think I have any hope
with<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:37.300> unless<00:04:37.690> anybody<00:04:37.990> has<00:04:38.169> any

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
with that so unless anybody has any

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.469 
with that so unless anybody has any
ideas<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.220> something<00:04:39.699> I<00:04:39.789> can<00:04:39.970> do<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.120> make<00:04:40.240> this

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
ideas on something I can do to make this

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.659 
ideas on something I can do to make this
thing<00:04:40.539> come<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.930> life<00:04:40.960> then<00:04:41.949> I<00:04:41.979> guess<00:04:42.370> I<00:04:42.639> am

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
thing come to life then I guess I am

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.580 
thing come to life then I guess I am
going<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.150> have<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.419> ship<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.750> in<00:04:43.900> to<00:04:44.080> Nintendo

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
going to have to ship it in to Nintendo

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.010 
going to have to ship it in to Nintendo
which<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:45.010> annoying<00:04:45.280> because<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.479> have<00:04:46.990> a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
which is annoying because I have a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.730 
which is annoying because I have a
American<00:04:47.860> yes<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:49.690> live<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:49.930> Japan<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.710> I

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
American yes and I live in Japan so I

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.129 
American yes and I live in Japan so I
have<00:04:50.949> to<00:04:51.070> ship<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.550> America<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.510> then<00:04:52.840> they

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
have to ship it to America and then they

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.010 
have to ship it to America and then they
can<00:04:53.620> probably<00:04:54.070> ship<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.030> China<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.660> then

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
can probably ship it to China and then

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.980 
can probably ship it to China and then
it<00:04:56.169> can<00:04:56.260> be<00:04:56.320> repaired<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.780> round<00:04:58.780> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
it can be repaired and then round and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.120 
it can be repaired and then round and
round<00:04:59.169> we<00:04:59.289> go<00:04:59.699> so<00:05:00.699> needless<00:05:01.449> to<00:05:01.479> say<00:05:01.690> I'm

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
round we go so needless to say I'm

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.159 
round we go so needless to say I'm
slightly<00:05:03.130> annoyed<00:05:03.430> about<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.930> but<00:05:04.930> honestly

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
slightly annoyed about it but honestly

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.529 
slightly annoyed about it but honestly
the<00:05:05.500> worst<00:05:05.770> part<00:05:06.070> is<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.820> is<00:05:07.000> loaded<00:05:07.360> up<00:05:07.479> with

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
the worst part is this is loaded up with

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.219 
the worst part is this is loaded up with
a<00:05:08.020> whole<00:05:08.289> bunch<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:09.270> downloaded<00:05:10.270> content<00:05:10.479> that

a whole bunch of downloaded content that

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.920 
a whole bunch of downloaded content that
I<00:05:11.259> had<00:05:11.470> paid<00:05:11.680> for<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.389> because<00:05:13.389> it<00:05:13.539> won't<00:05:13.690> boot

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
I had paid for and because it won't boot

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.290
