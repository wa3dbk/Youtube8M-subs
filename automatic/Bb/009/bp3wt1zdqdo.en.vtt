just<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.190> bit<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just a little bit now we can use a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.180 
just a little bit now we can use a
couple<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.899> different<00:01:43.170> types<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.500> implants<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
couple of different types of implants we

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.469 
couple of different types of implants we
can<00:01:44.369> use<00:01:44.520> something<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.880> lasts<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.390> about

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
can use something that lasts for about

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
can use something that lasts for about
six<00:01:45.869> months<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.039> last<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.430> years<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
six months some that last two years and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.460 
six months some that last two years and
we<00:01:48.000> also<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.810> permanent<00:01:49.409> solution<00:01:51.470> two

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
we also have a permanent solution two
