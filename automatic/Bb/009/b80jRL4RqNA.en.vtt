00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
just go to the brush tool I set my

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.040 
just go to the brush tool I set my
exposure<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.719> pretty

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
exposure you know all the way pretty

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
exposure you know all the way pretty
much<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.370> sure<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.789> quick

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
much and then make sure you have quick

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.930 
much and then make sure you have quick
mass<00:00:51.390> turned<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.890> auto<00:00:53.250> master<00:00:53.730> none

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
mass turned on you can auto master none

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.740 
mass turned on you can auto master none
because<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> will<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.520> will

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
because what that will do is it will

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.680 
because what that will do is it will
sense<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:58.140> detect<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:59.699> changes<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.180> contrast

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sense your detect it changes in contrast

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 
sense your detect it changes in contrast
so<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.070> drag<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> mask<00:01:03.480> on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so if I want to just drag this mask on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
so if I want to just drag this mask on
the<00:01:04.170> white<00:01:04.379> it'll<00:01:05.159> sense<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.180> only<00:01:06.810> want

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the white it'll sense that I only want

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
the white it'll sense that I only want
to<00:01:07.049> keep<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> white<00:01:07.590> enough<00:01:07.830> black<00:01:08.420> as

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to keep it on the white enough black as

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.190 
to keep it on the white enough black as
you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.580> like<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.820> close<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> can

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you can see like really close you can

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.530 
you can see like really close you can
see<00:01:13.409> there's<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.799> rings<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.360> outer

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
see there's two rings here the outer

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.499 
see there's two rings here the outer
ring<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.040> softness<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.000> how<00:01:18.119> soft<00:01:18.360> my

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
ring is the softness like how soft my

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.050 
ring is the softness like how soft my
brush<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.619> inner<00:01:19.860> ring<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.490> actual

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
brush is the inner ring is the actual

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
brush is the inner ring is the actual
brush<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.860> inner<00:01:23.009> rings<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
brush so like the inner rings that the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.350 
brush so like the inner rings that the
brush<00:01:24.390> data<00:01:24.720> rings<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> fade<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:27.150> quick

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
brush data rings the fade so the quick

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
brush data rings the fade so the quick
mask<00:01:27.659> will<00:01:28.200> work<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:30.119> inner<00:01:30.329> ring<00:01:30.689> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
mask will work up to the inner ring so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230 
mask will work up to the inner ring so
you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.619> bit<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.240> outer

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you can have a little bit of this outer

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.770 
you can have a little bit of this outer
ring<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:33.840> over<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:35.579> product<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.689> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
ring going over the product you can see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
ring going over the product you can see
some<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> gets<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.920> lighter<00:01:38.130> but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
some of it gets a little bit lighter but

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
some of it gets a little bit lighter but
you<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> product

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you don't want to go over the product

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
you don't want to go over the product
with<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.210> inner<00:01:42.540> ring<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
with the inner ring because then that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.230 
with the inner ring because then that
will<00:01:45.170> expose<00:01:46.170> over<00:01:46.740> expose<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.340> product

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
will expose over expose the product

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.370 
will expose over expose the product

and you can even push the option key or
the<00:01:53.280> Alt<00:01:53.399> key<00:01:53.719> that's<00:01:54.719> a<00:01:54.840> lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> stuff

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the Alt key that's a lot of the stuff

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069
