00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
mounting hardware so you can mount it on

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.109 
mounting hardware so you can mount it on
the<00:00:21.180> seat<00:00:21.570> post<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:22.260> actually<00:00:22.859> write<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.220> one

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.200 
of your bike frame areas so there's
three<00:00:28.410> pieces<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> very<00:00:29.820> handy

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.010> bike<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:39.180> has

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
if you have one on your bike it has

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.490 
if you have one on your bike it has
three<00:00:39.989> modes<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.960> small<00:00:42.960> button<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
three modes it has a small button on the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.810 
three modes it has a small button on the
front<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> hold<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.460> two

front that you hold for about two

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.130 
front that you hold for about two
seconds<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.420> turn<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
seconds to turn it on so that is the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.000 
seconds to turn it on so that is the
pulsing<00:00:49.829> mode<00:00:51.289> then<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:54.199> flash<00:00:55.199> pop

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
pulsing mode then it has a flash pop

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.290 
pulsing mode then it has a flash pop
mode<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> has<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> steady<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.609> mode<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
mode and that has a steady on mode and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.880 
mode and that has a steady on mode and
there's<00:01:01.289> also<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.649> very<00:01:01.980> good<00:01:02.250> sized<00:01:02.609> reflector

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
there's also a very good sized reflector

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.929 
there's also a very good sized reflector
high-quality<00:01:04.890> reflector<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> bottom

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
high-quality reflector on the bottom

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.219 
high-quality reflector on the bottom
here<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.720> different<00:01:07.080> than<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
here which is a little different than a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
here which is a little different than a
lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.770> bike<00:01:08.010> lights<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:09.140> as

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
lot of the other bike lights you see as

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
lot of the other bike lights you see as
far<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.530> comparison<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.340> another<00:01:11.460> strobe

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
far as a comparison to another strobe

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.270 
far as a comparison to another strobe
which<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.689> quite<00:01:12.930> nice<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.500> planet<00:01:14.130> bike

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
which is quite nice the planet bike

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.660 
which is quite nice the planet bike
super<00:01:14.700> flash<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.840> super<00:01:16.500> flash<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> half

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
super flash the super flash is a half

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
super flash the super flash is a half
watt<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:20.100> only<00:01:20.189> has<00:01:20.520> two<00:01:20.850> modes<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:22.860> has

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
watt and it only has two modes it has

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.030 
watt and it only has two modes it has
the<00:01:23.430> flashing<00:01:24.299> pop<00:01:24.600> mode<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> has<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the flashing pop mode and then it has a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420 
the flashing pop mode and then it has a
steady<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> mode<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.680> actually<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
steady on mode I actually do like the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
steady on mode I actually do like the
super<00:01:29.759> flash<00:01:30.030> mostly<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.560> two

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
super flash mostly because it has two

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
super flash mostly because it has two
additional<00:01:32.310> LEDs<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> bottom<00:01:34.220> but

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
additional LEDs at the bottom but

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
additional LEDs at the bottom but
overall<00:01:35.520> brightness<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.049> nearly

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
overall brightness it's just not nearly

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280 
overall brightness it's just not nearly
as<00:01:37.740> bright<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.700> half<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.270> bright<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.170> I'm

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
as bright it's not half as bright so I'm

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.920 
as bright it's not half as bright so I'm
going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> close<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> window<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going to close the window here so we can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260 
going to close the window here so we can
see<00:01:43.430> comparatively<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> wall<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
see comparatively on the wall what it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:53.480 
see comparatively on the wall what it
looks<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> steady<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
looks like so this is the steady on and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.740 
looks like so this is the steady on and
this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> super<00:01:54.390> flash<00:01:56.329> not<00:01:57.329> too<00:01:57.540> shabby

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
this is the super flash not too shabby

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
this is the super flash not too shabby
but<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> compare<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> rad

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
but when you compare it to the rad

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.959 
but when you compare it to the rad
bought<00:02:02.610> 1000<00:02:03.680> it's<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.979> comparing<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.729> little

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
bought 1000 it's like comparing a little

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.680 
bought 1000 it's like comparing a little
flashlight<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> searchlight

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
flashlight to a searchlight

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.100 
flashlight to a searchlight
there's<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.870> super<00:02:10.170> flash<00:02:10.410> 1/2<00:02:11.100> watt<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.900> rad

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
there's the super flash 1/2 watt the rad

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.980 
there's the super flash 1/2 watt the rad
bot<00:02:13.380> 1<00:02:14.190> watt<00:02:14.540> here<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.660> are<00:02:15.780> side<00:02:16.020> by<00:02:16.080> side

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
bot 1 watt here they are side by side

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.570 
bot 1 watt here they are side by side
pretty<00:02:18.990> significant<00:02:19.650> difference<00:02:19.980> they're

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
pretty significant difference they're

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.500 
pretty significant difference they're
both<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.030> same<00:02:21.180> price<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:23.330> like<00:02:24.330> them

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
both about the same price I like them

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.390 
both about the same price I like them
