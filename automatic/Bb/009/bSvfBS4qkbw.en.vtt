nails<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:50.220> smooths<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> little

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
nails they it smooths them out a little

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.510 
nails they it smooths them out a little
bit<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> wear<00:01:52.619> nothing<00:01:53.009> but

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
bit if I was going to wear nothing but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.190 
bit if I was going to wear nothing but
this<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.060> would<00:01:54.180> do<00:01:54.299> two<00:01:54.450> coats<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.049> just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
this I would do two coats but it just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
this I would do two coats but it just
seems<00:01:55.350> nice<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.549> OPI

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
seems nice it's kind of like an OPI

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.100 
seems nice it's kind of like an OPI
bubble<00:01:57.240> bath<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> look<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:57.960> guess

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bubble bath kind of look but i guess

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.380 
bubble bath kind of look but i guess
it's<00:01:58.259> supposed<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.560> good<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.890> nails

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
it's supposed to be good for your nails

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.069 
it's supposed to be good for your nails
so<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.540> i<00:02:00.570> got<00:02:00.899> two<00:02:01.200> colors<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.250> month<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
so then i got two colors this month and

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.289 
so then i got two colors this month and
this<00:02:04.079> first<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.680> laura<00:02:05.310> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> dark

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
this first one is laura which is a dark

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.999 
this first one is laura which is a dark
olive

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
olive

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.699 
olive
and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.299> one<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:10.019> much<00:02:10.170> clone<00:02:10.439> I<00:02:10.619> was

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and then this one is so much clone I was

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.809 
and then this one is so much clone I was
thinking<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> was<00:02:11.159> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.640> is

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
thinking it was going to be this is

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.179 
thinking it was going to be this is
ginger<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.659> this<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.829> like<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.280> tan<00:02:14.790> sand

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
ginger and this is like a tan sand

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.649 
ginger and this is like a tan sand
holographic<00:02:17.189> color<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.849> was<00:02:18.090> thinking<00:02:18.120> for

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
holographic color and I was thinking for

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.780 
holographic color and I was thinking for
some<00:02:18.780> reason<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.409> ginger<00:02:20.010> was<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.640> be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
some reason that ginger was going to be

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.589 
some reason that ginger was going to be
a<00:02:21.769> textured<00:02:22.769> nail<00:02:23.340> polish<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.180> sand

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
a textured nail polish like that sand

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.630 
a textured nail polish like that sand
look<00:02:25.049> or<00:02:25.260> something<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.860> don't<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.459> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
look or something and I don't think it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.860 
look or something and I don't think it's
mentally<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> look<00:02:27.299> back<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.599> website

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
mentally and I look back on the website

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.850 
mentally and I look back on the website
and<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.049> don't<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.319> where<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> got<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.709> idea

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and I don't know where I got that idea

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.640 
and I don't know where I got that idea

colors<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.889> me<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.599> is<00:02:54.750> what

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
colors for me and then here is what

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.869 
colors for me and then here is what
ginger<00:02:56.430> looks<00:02:57.389> like<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.340> very<00:02:59.519> subtle

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
ginger looks like on it's a very subtle

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.800 
ginger looks like on it's a very subtle
holographic<00:03:00.799> polish<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:01.980> might<00:03:02.159> look<00:03:02.310> more

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
holographic polish it might look more

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.240 
holographic polish it might look more
obvious<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.349> Sun<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:07.170> really<00:03:07.470> cool<00:03:07.739> here

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
obvious in the Sun but really cool here

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.460 
obvious in the Sun but really cool here
is<00:03:08.489> with<00:03:08.790> no<00:03:09.090> top<00:03:09.329> coat<00:03:09.629> here's<00:03:10.019> with<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.290> top

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
is with no top coat here's with the top

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.800 
is with no top coat here's with the top
coat<00:03:10.680> that's<00:03:10.799> included<00:03:11.310> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.239> mat<00:03:12.449> on<00:03:12.660> its

coat that's included kind of mat on its

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.250 
coat that's included kind of mat on its
own<00:03:13.849> really<00:03:14.849> benefits<00:03:15.329> from<00:03:15.449> the<00:03:15.930> top<00:03:16.079> coat

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
own really benefits from the top coat

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.289 
own really benefits from the top coat
but<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.709> pretty<00:03:17.069> it's<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.489> nude<00:03:17.849> and

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
but it's so pretty it's like a nude and

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.390 
but it's so pretty it's like a nude and
natural<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.290> metallic<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.280> it's

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
natural it's metallic but it's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.330 
natural it's metallic but it's
holographic<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.449> cool<00:03:21.829> really<00:03:22.829> glad<00:03:23.069> i<00:03:23.099> got

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
holographic so cool really glad i got

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.939 
holographic so cool really glad i got
this<00:03:23.519> one<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:24.480> then<00:03:24.750> here's<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.109> next<00:03:25.530> cool

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
this one and then here's the next cool

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.729 
this one and then here's the next cool
