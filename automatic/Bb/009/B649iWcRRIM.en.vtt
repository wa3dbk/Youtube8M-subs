00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.150
 oh la la what a pleasure well it's there 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.309
 finally there this arlÃ©sienne the cb in the sense 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.869
 honda since the time we talk about it 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.330
 it will even be available at the beginning 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.800
 year with us so much good enough 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.200
 meaning is what is the essence of the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.680
 motorcycle a motor 1 4 2 wheels a handlebar 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.060
 ussel 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.070
 here we can not do more simple 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.960
 so still good it's honda 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.809
 so he still has team and cb on 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.660
 feel of CRB thus braking crps 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.150
 coupled with the ds one has a lighthouse have 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 obviously for the style we have a painting 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 old-fashioned board with a small 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.700
 digital window we guess that there will be 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.850
 a fuel gauge 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.309
 a trip is surely a clock then 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.309
 looked at this tank as it is beautiful 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.300
 debugging a gondal job in the sky we have 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.969
 also right to a tank cap 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.399
 chrome and then a painting well 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.230
 deep a little metal flec as in 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.690
 the seventies ten know it's his 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 glittery paintings so here we go down 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.759
 the essential this beautiful transversal casting 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.830
 it's a new engine so old to 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.160
 design of course but a brand new 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.750
 engine 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.280
 they even managed to do the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.290
 well round foundries for that to be 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.360
 good retro and when we're sitting on the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.100
 motorcycle we see exceeded each side two 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.619
 reservoirs hangs so it's great 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.440
 nice then we go behind rascal 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.560
 80 on it obviously we would have liked 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.460
 a 4 in 4 but good in my opinion for the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.610
 production and approval costs 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.799
 who has a big 80 and then the case it's a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.439
 double classic steel cradle 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.880
 a similar swingarm and a pair of 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.740
 combine shock absorbers with a priori 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.430
 just a little adjustment of the of the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.140
 preloading 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 so that's actually the main thing 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.750
 of a motorcycle and then we like 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.730
 look we can put this candor 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 to take a small bag from 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.630
 weekend this is the cell we go away 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.630
 beautiful ciao
