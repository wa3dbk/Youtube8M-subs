00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 today we are going to make this chicken with apple 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.759
 the easy curry on our channel 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.860
 super madraza 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.920
 to do so let's take advantage of these 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.949
 apples that we have collected this fall 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.340
 We're going to need chicken breasts 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:21.470
 half onion apples curry and one garlic 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.900
 we started putting in a pot a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.670
 trickle of oil and we throw in it 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.789
 half onion let's do three 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.470
 chicken breasts cut the breasts 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.750
 in half although you could also 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.530
 have left whole and what we do is 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.350
 sautÃ© them we also take the tooth of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.839
 garlic and now we proceed to brown those that 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.479
 Once golden it will stay juicy 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.100
 when the sauce arrives well we take advantage 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.059
 while browning to peel the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.309
 apples and once it has browned and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.889
 chicken and onion what we are going to do 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.870
 is to incorporate the split apple into 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:59.510
 chunks the apple to us we like 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.269
 reineta but it is worth any other we throw 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.879
 one apple per breast as you see the 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.390
 size is not very big now 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.860
 we let everything be free that the apple 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.460
 it gets a little with the onion 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.720
 once we see what is perched what 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:23.650
 we do is incorporate 300 milliliters of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.190
 water of course we incorporate the curry 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.200
 we are throwing them is better to drain 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.600
 little by little going away trying it on 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.210
 we take four strokes 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.870
 of curry we also take advantage and we throw 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.690
 a little salt and a tad of pepper 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.510
 Well now what we do is leave 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.910
 cook until the chicken is done but 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.590
 one a quarter of an hour or so a 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.009
 fourth hour 20 minutes depends on the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 great that the breasts are finally 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.470
 What we do is remove the breast 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.210
 We passed the sauce through the blender and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.060
 we accompany what we like 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.790
 white rice mashed potatoes or in this 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.790
 delicious broccoli case
