00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
believe the star of this tank now would

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.770 
believe the star of this tank now would
be<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.080> two<00:02:38.650> deals<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.940> know<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.450> going

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
be the two deals you know this is going

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.170 
be the two deals you know this is going
to<00:02:40.900> be<00:02:40.989> their<00:02:41.230> tank<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.830> really<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.430> love<00:02:42.880> them

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to be their tank I really do love them

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.690 
to be their tank I really do love them
and<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.630> colors<00:02:44.019> are<00:02:44.260> amazing<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and the colors are amazing the the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.090 
and the colors are amazing the the
lighting<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.209> leave<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.290> on<00:02:50.380> about<00:02:50.709> eight<00:02:50.920> hours

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
lighting I leave it on about eight hours

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.840 
lighting I leave it on about eight hours
or<00:02:51.489> so<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:53.140> plants<00:02:53.410> they<00:02:53.769> seem<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.820> well

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
or so the plants they seem to do well

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.140 
or so the plants they seem to do well
and<00:02:55.090> grow<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.900> lot<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.500> new<00:02:56.950> leaves

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.670 

under<00:03:01.810> there

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
under there

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.110 
under there
everyone<00:03:04.680> gets<00:03:04.920> along<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.490> little<00:03:05.910> bit

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
everyone gets along a little bit

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.570 
everyone gets along a little bit
aggression<00:03:06.660> from<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.990> jills<00:03:07.290> that's<00:03:08.280> their

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
aggression from the jills that's their

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880 
aggression from the jills that's their
spot<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.600> I'm<00:03:09.720> thinking<00:03:09.750> they're<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
spot so I'm thinking they're going to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.260 
spot so I'm thinking they're going to
lay<00:03:11.040> soon<00:03:11.390> always<00:03:12.390> chasing<00:03:13.350> fish<00:03:13.590> away<00:03:14.270> other

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
lay soon always chasing fish away other

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.330 
lay soon always chasing fish away other
than<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.450> there's<00:03:16.050> no<00:03:16.170> problems<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.920> Angels

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
than that there's no problems the Angels

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.730 
than that there's no problems the Angels
don't<00:03:17.520> bother<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.900> Cardinals<00:03:19.410> if<00:03:19.590> you're

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
don't bother the the Cardinals if you're

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.770 
don't bother the the Cardinals if you're
wondering<00:03:19.980> though<00:03:20.430> maybe<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.150> neons<00:03:21.510> because

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
wondering though maybe the neons because

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
wondering though maybe the neons because
they're<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:21.990> lot<00:03:22.140> smaller<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:23.280> these

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
they're a lot smaller but these

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.730 
they're a lot smaller but these
Cardinals<00:03:23.910> are<00:03:24.030> much<00:03:24.270> bigger<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.720> there's<00:03:25.470> no

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
Cardinals are much bigger and there's no

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.230 
Cardinals are much bigger and there's no
problem<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.730> angels<00:03:29.060> other<00:03:30.060> than<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
problem with the angels other than that

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.260 
problem with the angels other than that
that's<00:03:30.840> about<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.530> know<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:32.790> idea<00:03:32.850> of

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
that's about it you know the idea of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.310 
that's about it you know the idea of
this<00:03:33.390> tank<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.230> two<00:03:34.470> islands<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
this tank was that have two islands and

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.620 
this tank was that have two islands and
just<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.650> sand<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.860> escape<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.880> definitely

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
just the sand this escape is definitely

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.300 
just the sand this escape is definitely
not<00:03:42.870> going<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.200> change<00:03:43.470> its<00:03:43.800> going<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:44.040> stay

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
not going to change its going to stay

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.880 
not going to change its going to stay
the<00:03:44.490> way<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:48.000> really<00:03:48.890> haven't

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
the way it is I just really haven't

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.570 
the way it is I just really haven't
