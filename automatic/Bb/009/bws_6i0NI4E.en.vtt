00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello here I am 80 8 with a new one 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 to box for you and I think so 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.560
 that there are the black mixa in there and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 Although I am packing this by the way 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 Actually , where did I get them from 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 and frontal ii express they had 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.320
 namely an action maybe throws 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.329
 still and for free the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:43.110
 black mixa with dhl shipping 53 euro 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:54.180
 not him so you ordered as 370 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 dollars back then have exactly 53 euros 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 tasted and the whole is inside 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.019
 So on 24 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.720
 Christmas Eve I put it has 25 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.490
 The connection was given but on 26 was 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.850
 it sent off and today is the 28 and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.250
 thus the two days has taken the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.409
 is super fast for DHL shipping 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.820
 and the whole is here in one now 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.470
 bubble wrap very well packed and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:37.340
 then here again with one with one 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.869
 one earlier so that's the one 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:49.640
 otherwise he will not see if he likes it 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:52.079
 is opened namely and yes 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.969
 I'll do away with the whole heap 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.960
 and here they are already 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.390
 and the whole is still here 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.539
 Wrapped the packaging only looks 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.579
 a little bit battered 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.950
 up here that holds but very doll 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.260
 within limits 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.599
 I'll show you right now and that 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.819
 Here are the first packaging here 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.010
 above is a small corner and off 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.440
 here is a bit squeezed there 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 but otherwise sees the packaging so 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 a corner a bit 19 the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 you open it again 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.180

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.230

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.250
 Now we're pulling those too 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.650
