00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.430 

so<00:00:11.550> today<00:00:11.759> we're<00:00:11.940> testing<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.509> 2011<00:00:13.049> tundra

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so today we're testing the 2011 tundra

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.340 
so today we're testing the 2011 tundra
so<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.160> has<00:00:14.280> got<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> 5.7<00:00:15.330> liter<00:00:15.509> v8<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:16.199> an

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
so this has got the 5.7 liter v8 it's an

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
so this has got the 5.7 liter v8 it's an
engine<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.920> come<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> love<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.119> know

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
engine that we've come to love I know

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.970 
engine that we've come to love I know
it's<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:18.750> race<00:00:18.900> truck<00:00:19.230> absolutely<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's in your race truck absolutely and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.950 
it's in your race truck absolutely and
we<00:00:20.220> we've<00:00:20.520> also<00:00:20.760> used<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> vehicle<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.779> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
we we've also used the vehicle like this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
we we've also used the vehicle like this
before<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.740> Overland<00:00:23.070> journal<00:00:23.340> testing<00:00:23.760> we

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
before for Overland journal testing we

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
before for Overland journal testing we
actually<00:00:24.180> had<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> regular<00:00:24.840> cab<00:00:25.050> long<00:00:25.380> bed<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
actually had a regular cab long bed and

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.490 
actually had a regular cab long bed and
we<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:27.180> enjoyed<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.510> truck<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.289> seemed

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we really enjoyed the truck it seemed

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.009 
we really enjoyed the truck it seemed
like<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> good<00:00:29.160> fit<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> reliability<00:00:30.359> side

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
like a good fit for the reliability side

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
like a good fit for the reliability side
for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> typical<00:00:32.189> Overland<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:32.790> somebody

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
for the typical Overland or somebody

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400 
for the typical Overland or somebody
that<00:00:33.090> wants<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.809> camper<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.320> back

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that wants to put a camper on the back

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
that wants to put a camper on the back
or<00:00:34.890> tow<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> bigger<00:00:36.030> trailer<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:37.320> where

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
or tow a bigger trailer something where

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.990 
or tow a bigger trailer something where
they<00:00:37.559> need<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.219> payload<00:00:38.670> as

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
they need a little bit more payload as

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
they need a little bit more payload as
perhaps<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> family<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.829> need

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
perhaps they have a family and they need

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.440 
perhaps they have a family and they need
to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.190> able<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.430> carry<00:00:41.640> four<00:00:41.879> people<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to be able to carry four people in a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
to be able to carry four people in a
larger<00:00:42.809> truck<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> still<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> camper<00:00:44.010> so

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
larger truck and still have a camper so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790 
larger truck and still have a camper so
even<00:00:45.000> though<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.690> my<00:00:45.809> preferences<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.500> prefer

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
even though for my preferences I prefer

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.529 
even though for my preferences I prefer
a<00:00:46.829> smaller<00:00:47.340> vehicle<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.149> tested<00:00:48.480> with

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
a smaller vehicle like we tested with

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
a smaller vehicle like we tested with
the<00:00:48.600> tacoma<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.289> other<00:00:49.410> day<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the tacoma the other day and some of the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.340 
the tacoma the other day and some of the
jeeps<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> case<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:51.989> know<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
jeeps but in this case we know that a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
jeeps but in this case we know that a
lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> people<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> full-size<00:00:53.730> truck<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lot of people like a full-size truck and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
lot of people like a full-size truck and
this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> Toyota's<00:00:55.500> first<00:00:55.860> offering<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
this is Toyota's first offering in the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
this is Toyota's first offering in the
true<00:00:56.699> full-size<00:00:57.180> market<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:57.960> they've

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
true full-size market you know they've

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
true full-size market you know they've
had<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.469> very<00:00:58.590> successful<00:00:58.829> larger<00:00:59.609> vehicles

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
had some very successful larger vehicles

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
had some very successful larger vehicles
like<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> t100<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
like the t100 and then the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
like the t100 and then the
first-generation<00:01:02.730> tundra<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.960> thought

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
first-generation tundra which I thought

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140 
first-generation tundra which I thought
was<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> great<00:01:04.589> truck<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> whole

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
was a great truck but this is a whole

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940 
was a great truck but this is a whole
new<00:01:06.299> vehicle<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.720> Toyota<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.650> whole

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
new vehicle for Toyota and it's a whole

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.320 
new vehicle for Toyota and it's a whole
new<00:01:08.100> market<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.490> them<00:01:08.790> they've<00:01:09.180> been

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
new market for them they've been

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.510 
new market for them they've been
successful<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> we're<00:01:11.100> gonna<00:01:11.220> find

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
successful with it and we're gonna find

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
successful with it and we're gonna find
out<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> does<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.299> what<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
out what it does well and what it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
out what it does well and what it
doesn't<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.460> took<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
doesn't do so well so we just took the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
doesn't do so well so we just took the
tundra<00:01:15.330> through<00:01:15.689> our<00:01:15.869> crossed<00:01:16.350> axle<00:01:16.770> obstacle

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
tundra through our crossed axle obstacle

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.210 
tundra through our crossed axle obstacle
it<00:01:17.939> gives<00:01:18.119> us<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> chance<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.840> measure<00:01:19.560> frame

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it gives us a chance to measure frame

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
it gives us a chance to measure frame
flex<00:01:20.520> axle<00:01:21.479> articulation<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
flex axle articulation and then how the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
flex axle articulation and then how the
traction<00:01:23.640> control<00:01:23.939> system<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> locking

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
traction control system or the locking

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
traction control system or the locking
differentials<00:01:25.470> perform<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:26.670> of

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
differentials perform in this kind of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.640 
differentials perform in this kind of
environment<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.020> interesting<00:01:28.500> with

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
environment and it was interesting with

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.749 
environment and it was interesting with
the<00:01:28.770> tundra<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.250> obviously<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> has<00:01:29.729> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the tundra because obviously it has a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.890 
the tundra because obviously it has a
couple<00:01:30.090> things<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
couple things going for it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.240 
couple things going for it
advantage<00:01:31.350> wise<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> nice<00:01:32.040> long

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
advantage wise it's got a nice long

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.399 
advantage wise it's got a nice long
wheelbase<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:33.540> does<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> quite<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
wheelbase it does have quite a bit of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.950 
wheelbase it does have quite a bit of
rear<00:01:34.619> articulation<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> did<00:01:36.570> reach<00:01:36.750> its

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
rear articulation but it did reach its

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
rear articulation but it did reach its
limits<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> wheels<00:01:37.920> started<00:01:38.189> coming<00:01:38.520> off

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
limits and the wheels started coming off

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
limits and the wheels started coming off
the<00:01:38.759> ground<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.320> quickly<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> wheel

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the ground and quickly with the wheel

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.649 
the ground and quickly with the wheel
spin<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> noticed<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> came<00:01:42.479> through

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
spin so I noticed when you came through

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
spin so I noticed when you came through
there<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.409> took<00:01:43.680> quite<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.369> throttle

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
there it took quite a bit of throttle

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.060 
there it took quite a bit of throttle
input<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.840> order<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.500> response<00:01:46.770> from

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
input in order to get a response from

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
input in order to get a response from
the<00:01:47.250> traction<00:01:47.610> control<00:01:47.909> system<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the traction control system yeah I was I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.710 
the traction control system yeah I was I
was<00:01:49.290> over<00:01:49.560> 50%<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> throttle<00:01:50.880> waiting

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
was over 50% into the throttle waiting

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.260 
was over 50% into the throttle waiting
for<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.020> trash<00:01:52.350> control<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> come<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
for that trash control to come in you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120 
for that trash control to come in you
know<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.750> used<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> coming<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.740> earlier

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
know I'm used to coming in much earlier

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
know I'm used to coming in much earlier
so<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.880> delayed<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.509> maybe

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so I think it was delayed a bit maybe

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.230 
so I think it was delayed a bit maybe
the<00:01:58.320> tuning<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.340> very<00:01:59.549> effective<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the tuning but it was very effective and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.450 
the tuning but it was very effective and
once<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> traction

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
once I got going and in the traction

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.590 
once I got going and in the traction
control<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.729> working<00:02:02.939> transferring<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
control is working transferring that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.179 
control is working transferring that
torque<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.770> mosey<00:02:05.070> right

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
torque I just you know mosey right

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:05.929 
torque I just you know mosey right
through<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
through that

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
through that
so<00:02:06.180> once<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> traction<00:02:06.990> control<00:02:07.020> came<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so once the traction control came in I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
so once the traction control came in I
thought

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
thought

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.940 
thought
effective<00:02:08.869> but<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> thing<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.500> concerned

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
effective but the thing that concerned

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.559 
effective but the thing that concerned
me<00:02:10.039> was<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.429> required<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:11.030> much<00:02:11.060> throttle

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
me was it required so much throttle

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.080 
me was it required so much throttle
input<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> traditional<00:02:13.040> driver<00:02:13.370> isn't

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
input so the traditional driver isn't

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.520 
input so the traditional driver isn't
gonna<00:02:14.209> know<00:02:14.480> once<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.319> kind<00:02:15.470> of

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
gonna know once they get that kind of

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.990 
gonna know once they get that kind of
wheel<00:02:15.709> spin<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:16.220> rusted<00:02:16.489> for<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.730> length

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
wheel spin it's rusted for that length

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.309 
wheel spin it's rusted for that length
of<00:02:17.209> time<00:02:17.270> they're<00:02:17.930> gonna<00:02:17.989> think<00:02:18.290> something's

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
of time they're gonna think something's

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.440 
of time they're gonna think something's
wrong<00:02:18.920> they're<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:19.489> back<00:02:19.700> off<00:02:19.730> or<00:02:20.209> hit<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
wrong they're gonna back off or hit the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.089 
wrong they're gonna back off or hit the
brake<00:02:20.660> which<00:02:20.810> will<00:02:20.959> cancel<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.590> then

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
brake which will cancel it and then

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.309 
brake which will cancel it and then
they'll<00:02:22.220> fail<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.640> climb<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.870> case<00:02:24.110> I

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
they'll fail to climb so in this case I

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.440 
they'll fail to climb so in this case I
was<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.709> was<00:02:24.950> concerned<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.730> very<00:02:26.239> heavy

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
was I was concerned with a very heavy

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.770 
was I was concerned with a very heavy
truck<00:02:26.780> with<00:02:27.470> 380<00:02:28.250> horsepower<00:02:28.459> that<00:02:29.390> requires

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
truck with 380 horsepower that requires

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.830 
truck with 380 horsepower that requires
50<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.470> 60%<00:02:30.860> throttle<00:02:31.790> input<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.450> order<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.720> get

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
50 to 60% throttle input in order to get

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.479 
50 to 60% throttle input in order to get
response<00:02:33.230> from<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.470> traction<00:02:33.860> control<00:02:33.890> yeah

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
response from the traction control yeah

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.729 
response from the traction control yeah
I<00:02:34.519> mean<00:02:34.700> as<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.390> driver<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:35.959> used<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.319> kind<00:02:36.680> of

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
I mean as a driver I'm used to kind of

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.440 
I mean as a driver I'm used to kind of
have<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.040> good<00:02:37.160> feel<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.400> when<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.269> lift

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
have a good feel for when to lift

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.300 
have a good feel for when to lift
throttle<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:38.959> all<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.410> definitely<00:02:40.190> was

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
throttle and all that I definitely was

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.890 
throttle and all that I definitely was
surprised<00:02:40.730> by<00:02:40.910> how<00:02:41.060> much<00:02:41.180> will<00:02:41.420> spin<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.750> was

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
surprised by how much will spin I was

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.479 
surprised by how much will spin I was
getting<00:02:42.230> I'm<00:02:42.319> like<00:02:42.440> okay<00:02:42.709> do<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:42.920> need<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.280> kind

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
getting I'm like okay do I need to kind

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.490 
getting I'm like okay do I need to kind
of<00:02:43.550> stop<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.600> get<00:02:44.959> out<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.170> know<00:02:45.230> slow

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
of stop this and get out you know slow

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.380 
of stop this and get out you know slow
it<00:02:45.560> down<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.549> know<00:02:46.640> get<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.090> vehicle

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
it down and you know get the vehicle

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it down and you know get the vehicle
slowed<00:02:47.600> down<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.989> don't<00:02:48.110> get<00:02:48.230> too<00:02:48.319> much

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
slowed down so I don't get too much

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
slowed down so I don't get too much
wheel<00:02:48.620> spin<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> knew<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.000> system<00:02:50.209> was

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
wheel spin but I knew the system was

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.210 
wheel spin but I knew the system was
gonna<00:02:50.660> work<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.049> knew<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.500> put<00:02:51.680> more<00:02:51.830> throttle

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
gonna work I knew if I put more throttle

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.500 
gonna work I knew if I put more throttle
into<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.640> was<00:02:52.730> gonna<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.360> me

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
into it it was gonna you know get me

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.059 
into it it was gonna you know get me
through<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.930> that's<00:02:54.049> what<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.319> did<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:54.920> your

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
through and that's what it did but your

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.400 
through and that's what it did but your
average<00:02:55.370> driver<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:57.049> gotta<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.380> a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
average driver you know you gotta be a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.930 
average driver you know you gotta be a
little<00:02:57.530> careful<00:02:57.680> you've<00:02:58.040> got<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.580> drivers

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
little careful you've got it the drivers

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.610 
little careful you've got it the drivers
not<00:02:59.030> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.269> know<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.230> need<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.470> give<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
not going to know that I need to give it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.720 
not going to know that I need to give it
more<00:03:00.680> throttle<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> think<00:03:01.430> there's<00:03:01.670> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
more throttle so I think there's a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.820 
more throttle so I think there's a
little<00:03:01.940> bit<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.180> tuning<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.319> know<00:03:03.410> could<00:03:03.709> be

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
little bit of tuning you know could be

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.140 
little bit of tuning you know could be
probably<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.130> little<00:03:04.160> better<00:03:04.400> yeah<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.060> think

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
probably a little better yeah so I think

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.270 
probably a little better yeah so I think
that<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.720> typical<00:03:05.959> steady<00:03:06.769> throttle

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that the typical steady throttle

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.190 
that the typical steady throttle
response<00:03:07.459> we<00:03:07.940> got<00:03:08.120> like<00:03:08.360> out<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> track

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
response we got like out of the a track

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.259 
response we got like out of the a track
in<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> Tacoma<00:03:09.920> or<00:03:10.250> we've<00:03:10.760> seen<00:03:10.970> with<00:03:11.120> some<00:03:11.239> of

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
in the Tacoma or we've seen with some of

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.970 
in the Tacoma or we've seen with some of
the<00:03:11.360> Land<00:03:11.540> Rover<00:03:11.660> products<00:03:12.200> wasn't<00:03:12.739> quite<00:03:12.859> as

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the Land Rover products wasn't quite as

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.680 
the Land Rover products wasn't quite as
effective<00:03:13.400> with<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.609> tundra<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.359> required

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
effective with the tundra it required

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.270 
effective with the tundra it required
quite<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> bit<00:03:15.200> more<00:03:15.350> wheel<00:03:15.620> spin<00:03:15.920> which<00:03:16.100> my

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
quite a bit more wheel spin which my

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.460 
quite a bit more wheel spin which my
concern<00:03:16.670> would<00:03:16.850> be<00:03:16.910> wheel<00:03:17.540> spin<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.140> then

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
concern would be wheel spin and then

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.840 
concern would be wheel spin and then
either<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.769> comes<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.070> contact<00:03:19.220> with<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.640> rock

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
either it comes in contact with a rock

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.940 
either it comes in contact with a rock
or<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> high<00:03:20.329> traction<00:03:20.660> surface<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.560> that

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
or a high traction surface and that

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.970 
or a high traction surface and that
brakes<00:03:22.190> an<00:03:22.340> axle<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.570> case<00:03:23.980> overall

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
brakes an axle so in this case overall

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.620 
brakes an axle so in this case overall
it<00:03:25.100> made<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.400> through<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.609> obstacle<00:03:26.120> but<00:03:26.299> not

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
it made it through the obstacle but not

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.050 
it made it through the obstacle but not
very<00:03:26.870> elegantly<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.829> for<00:03:28.040> me<00:03:28.160> overall<00:03:28.579> I<00:03:29.000> would

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
very elegantly so for me overall I would

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.960 
very elegantly so for me overall I would
say<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.410> road<00:03:30.620> performance<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.340> very

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
say that the road performance is very

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.750 
say that the road performance is very
enjoyable<00:03:32.150> nice<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.170> drive<00:03:33.410> higher<00:03:34.370> speed

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
enjoyable nice to drive higher speed

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.580 
enjoyable nice to drive higher speed
dirt<00:03:35.000> performance<00:03:35.570> really<00:03:35.959> good<00:03:36.320> no

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
dirt performance really good no

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.620 
dirt performance really good no
vibration<00:03:37.250> very<00:03:37.549> predictable<00:03:38.090> handling

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
vibration very predictable handling

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.380 
vibration very predictable handling
about<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.530> vehicle<00:03:39.950> stability<00:03:40.130> program<00:03:40.880> did

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
about the vehicle stability program did

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.599 
about the vehicle stability program did
what<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.600> expected<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.380> do<00:03:42.620> when<00:03:43.370> we<00:03:43.459> get

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
what I expected it to do when we get

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.160 
what I expected it to do when we get
into<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.850> more<00:03:43.970> technical<00:03:44.000> terrain<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.930> size

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
into the more technical terrain the size

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.500 
into the more technical terrain the size
of<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.380> truck<00:03:45.620> becomes<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.220> problem<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
of the truck becomes a problem and the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.120 
of the truck becomes a problem and the
traction<00:03:47.750> control<00:03:47.959> isn't<00:03:48.380> as<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.680> sponsored

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
traction control isn't as in sponsored

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.949 
traction control isn't as in sponsored
as<00:03:49.250> we'd<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.600> would<00:03:50.690> say

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
as we'd like it to be but I would say

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.990 
as we'd like it to be but I would say
it's<00:03:51.109> still<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.620> class<00:03:51.890> above<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.790> typical

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
it's still a class above the typical

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.509 
it's still a class above the typical
Chevrolet<00:03:53.690> or<00:03:53.840> for<00:03:54.109> truckers<00:03:54.470> now<00:03:55.190> where<00:03:55.400> it

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
Chevrolet or for truckers now where it

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.400 
Chevrolet or for truckers now where it
does<00:03:55.760> fall<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.450> little<00:03:56.660> bit<00:03:56.810> behind<00:03:57.019> would<00:03:57.290> be

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
does fall a little bit behind would be

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.470 
does fall a little bit behind would be
compared<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.069> let's<00:03:58.459> say<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.670> Power<00:03:59.299> Wagon

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
compared to like let's say a Power Wagon

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.729 
compared to like let's say a Power Wagon
with<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.870> differential<00:04:00.380> locks<00:04:00.560> and

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
with the differential locks and

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.770 
with the differential locks and
everything<00:04:00.799> like<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.910> its<00:04:02.090> class<00:04:02.390> I

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
everything like that so in its class I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.479 
everything like that so in its class I
think<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:03.350> much<00:04:03.769> better<00:04:04.010> than<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.370> average

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
think it's much better than the average

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.849 
think it's much better than the average
for<00:04:05.209> those<00:04:05.359> characteristics<00:04:06.139> compared<00:04:06.799> to

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
for those characteristics compared to

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.289 
for those characteristics compared to
the<00:04:06.950> other<00:04:07.069> things<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.340> we've<00:04:07.519> tested<00:04:07.670> not

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
the other things that we've tested not

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.849 
the other things that we've tested not
as<00:04:08.450> good<00:04:08.630> yeah<00:04:09.079> you<00:04:09.139> know<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.530> sequential

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
as good yeah you know the sequential

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.309 
as good yeah you know the sequential
shift<00:04:10.069> is<00:04:10.459> really<00:04:10.489> fun<00:04:11.090> if<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.930> want<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.290> a

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
shift is really fun if you want to get a

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.330 
shift is really fun if you want to get a
lot<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.500> wheel<00:04:12.620> spin<00:04:12.650> maybe<00:04:13.130> you're<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.280> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
lot of wheel spin maybe you're in the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.039 
lot of wheel spin maybe you're in the
sand<00:04:13.579> dunes<00:04:13.790> things<00:04:14.090> like<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.450> one<00:04:14.870> thing

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
sand dunes things like that one thing

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.690 
sand dunes things like that one thing
that<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.230> picked<00:04:15.500> up<00:04:15.650> on<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:15.950> vehicle<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.669> a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
that I picked up on the vehicle is a

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.729 
that I picked up on the vehicle is a
steering<00:04:17.299> effort<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.900> build<00:04:18.140> up<00:04:18.320> just<00:04:18.590> how

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
steering effort and build up just how

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.729 
steering effort and build up just how
white<00:04:19.039> it<00:04:19.070> is

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
white it is

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.710 
white it is
just<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.430> little<00:04:20.669> bit<00:04:20.789> vague<00:04:20.940> on<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.389> know<00:04:21.479> for

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
just a little bit vague on you know for

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.170 
just a little bit vague on you know for
my<00:04:21.840> liking<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.430> also<00:04:23.610> something<00:04:23.940> you

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
my liking but it is also something you

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.969 
my liking but it is also something you
get<00:04:24.360> used<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.289> it's<00:04:25.530> kind<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.800> one<00:04:25.949> of

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
get used to so it's it's kind of one of

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.950 
get used to so it's it's kind of one of
those<00:04:26.099> things<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.090> think<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.479> big<00:04:27.690> truck

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
those things and I think on a big truck

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.930 
those things and I think on a big truck
pulling<00:04:28.319> a<00:04:28.500> big<00:04:28.650> load<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.400> don't<00:04:29.580> want<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:29.789> a

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
pulling a big load you don't want it a

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.969 
pulling a big load you don't want it a
steering<00:04:30.539> that's<00:04:30.780> too<00:04:30.930> sensitive<00:04:31.349> but<00:04:31.650> I

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
steering that's too sensitive but I

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.469 
steering that's too sensitive but I
think<00:04:32.220> maybe<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.729> application<00:04:33.330> it's

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
think maybe in this application it's

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.300 
think maybe in this application it's
just<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.780> tad<00:04:34.050> too<00:04:34.319> light<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:34.860> just<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:35.130> little

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
just a tad too light it's just a little

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.309
