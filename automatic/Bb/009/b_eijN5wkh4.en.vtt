00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.250
 Hi, people here today and today I came to talk. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.590
 from the book my silent 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 2000 the author's first published book 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 here in brazil was the launch of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.130
 February story has a medium book 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.650
 narrated by the toothpick in fact the name 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.070
 His is here but everyone calls him 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 stick stick then the translation 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.789
 he kept a toothpick here in Brazil he is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.700
 a boy who was born civilian in one of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.100
 ears since small it suffers a 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.320
 certain bullying because of it all 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 world to see it for the first time hi 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.480
 or see it usually both has a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 different reaction and he notes these 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.219
 people's reactions are few and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.559
 people who treat and then naturally 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.260
 it when people still treat 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.360
 currently he is even surprised 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.129
 besides not having one ear suffer 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 with bullying because of that he does 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.289
 part of a very evil family he 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.780
 brother suffers in the parents' hand because they 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.479
 they treat very very poorly 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.159
 he even in a torture room 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.110
 well know theoretically would be a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 guest room plus parents never 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 receive the worst when they do 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 something like that is not even really 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 so so mean 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.950
 the father takes him mainly brother more 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.759
 Old toothpick of this room 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 torture and beat their brother they do not have 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.549
 a good relationship with the family and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.409
 a family support but for him it ends 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 being normal because that's all he 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.070
 had a lifetime 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.420
 from the moment he notices how the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.079
 other people the other families 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 work is going to roll this is if this 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.110
 family question really so good 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 the author's greater fixations with this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 book is to demonstrate how toothpick as 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.310
 it is really the sight of the toothpick with the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 toothpick watches the world so in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 some passages from the book show encounter 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 for you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.930
 it is a phrase and has a spacing and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.720
 then another sentence is another word or 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.679
 phrase that is to try to demonstrate more 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.569
 or less like 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.900
 the toothpick will listen to those words that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 he listens to her according to the movement 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.280
 that he does he listens differently or more 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.790
 because he will only have one of the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:30.359
 ears and also has some alignments 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.420
 paragraphs that are to the right and is 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.849
 as if it were a phrase in the same thing 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.189
 it's like a thought phrase 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.620
 of the toothpick and beyond 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.280
 problems with bullying with parents everything 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.040
 more 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.569
 the author ends up inserting other themes 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.819
 controversial book 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.680
 all because because of these 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.530
 discussions of this treatment that the father 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.959
 has brother with him has a discovery 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.810
 brother and brother ends up revealing 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.409
 Can not wait to leave home and shit. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.849
 icasa of house and the stick is without floor 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.030
 because the brother is the only thing he 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.889
 in the world do they know how to part 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.709
 brother wants to know where brother 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.599
 lining is in good shape that ends 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.620
 encountering drugs with criminality 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.019
 with sexual discoveries, everything but 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.870
 the author ends up passing only a vision 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.299
 shallow of the things I miss 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.639
 of a deepening and that was what 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.099
 what else did you bother to listen to ? 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.799
 a star because every time I had a 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.919
 potential emotional burden or have become 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.959
 I went deeper into it and just woke up 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.239
 I 'm going to cry, I 'm going to cry, I'm not there. 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.549
 neither because I did not cry but it's always 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.040
 that thing as soon as it's going to be a 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.500
 high point of the book and it will not stop 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.069
 high ends up being for me when the two 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.430
 receive a little love knows 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.909
 What I wrote in the book review 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:01.199
 it's like you can finally breathe 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:03.599
 with relief as she felt relieved 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.909
 because of the characters receiving love 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.720
 this is a lot was this is a high point 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.389
 from the book 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.139
 Anyway, I still felt that I missed something. 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.959
 more on page 11 other parts so I 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.930
 I just felt this I had more feeling. 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.459
 the receiver gets sort of just waiting for 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
 that event waiting for you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.620
 waiting for the spirit 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.180
 the very high festival I need so 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 that I stayed was in that expectation 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.639
 something overwhelming happens and we 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.860
 it was not so anyway I recommend 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.380
 much this book mainly for 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.139
 cause of toothpick relation with brother 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.810
 the countries and this family thing and he 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.500
 needing both support and family 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.190
 not walking 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.419
 in addition to the artifacts of the same text 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.460
 that the author had accused the publisher faces 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.180
 a good choice of title because the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.800
 English title of this kind only toothpick 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.479
 does not represent anything my half 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.229
 silent is much more representative 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.520
 for the story and yet they did 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.360
 want people 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.830
 the book has one of the ears it has this 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.259
 area here but has no such 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.240
 the author writes very well and I 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.509
 I'm anxious to read the next 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.759
 books that are going to be out there soon 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.289
 I think the teacher who has berg will 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.840
 publish more books of the author I 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.669
 recommend enough is that we hope 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.979
 If you liked this video I have 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.469
 A little bit still trying to catch the rhythm. 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.380
 again if you liked the video, no 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:39.180
 forget to leave the joinha and help 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.770
 much in the disclosure and enroll in the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.599
 channel to receive the next videos 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.909
 because whoever writes receives the bugs 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.289
 first was this I see you in the 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.289
 next week in the next video
