00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
lock boxes so after winning that I

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.600 
lock boxes so after winning that I
decided<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.440> go<00:04:51.590> ahead<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:51.919> straight<00:04:52.220> over

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
decided to go ahead and straight over

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.010

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
and open some lock boxes I had seven of

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.590 
and open some lock boxes I had seven of
eight<00:04:57.199> comic<00:04:57.710> covers<00:04:58.070> but<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:58.970> really<00:04:59.330> didn't

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
eight comic covers but I really didn't

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.689 
eight comic covers but I really didn't
get<00:04:59.720> hardly<00:05:00.139> any<00:05:00.260> duplicates<00:05:01.039> I<00:05:01.280> believe<00:05:01.550> only

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
get hardly any duplicates I believe only

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.740 
get hardly any duplicates I believe only
got<00:05:02.000> one<00:05:02.300> up<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.600> this<00:05:02.720> point<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:03.979> it<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.310> most

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
got one up to this point to it the most

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.390 
got one up to this point to it the most
so<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.780> didn't<00:05:06.139> expect<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.530> get<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.860> last<00:05:07.070> cover

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
so I didn't expect to get the last cover

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.909 
so I didn't expect to get the last cover
but<00:05:07.729> but<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.270> left<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.660> recording<00:05:09.199> run<00:05:09.440> just<00:05:09.770> in

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
but but I left the recording run just in

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.450 
but but I left the recording run just in
case<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.810> we<00:05:11.990> skipped<00:05:12.229> through<00:05:12.500> this<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.979> we

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
case so we skipped through this and we

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.930 
case so we skipped through this and we
go<00:05:13.639> to<00:05:13.699> the<00:05:13.940> collections<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.949> I<00:05:15.979> go<00:05:16.280> for<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.550> 10

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
go to the collections so I go for the 10

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.180 
go to the collections so I go for the 10
*<00:05:17.240> option<00:05:17.810> because<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.139> always<00:05:18.470> go<00:05:18.800> for<00:05:19.010> that
