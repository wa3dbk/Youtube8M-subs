size<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640

single<00:00:29.910> serving<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.289> calculations<00:00:31.830> are

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
single serving but the calculations are

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.190 
single serving but the calculations are
pretty<00:00:32.099> easy<00:00:32.450> if<00:00:33.450> you're<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.660> scale<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.020> up

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
pretty easy if you're gonna scale it up

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
talk about the cava just cuz I think it

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.729 
talk about the cava just cuz I think it
helps<00:03:19.760> lighten<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.810> that's<00:03:21.380> how<00:03:21.560> I

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
helps lighten it and so that's how I

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.949 
helps lighten it and so that's how I
write<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.819> punch<00:03:23.090> here<00:03:23.329> and<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.540> really

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
write this this punch here and I really

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:24.970

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
like I'm really happy with how it turned

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 
like I'm really happy with how it turned
out<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.340> think<00:03:25.519> it's<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:26.000> kind<00:03:26.299> of<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.450> great

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
out I think it's a kind of a great

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.289 
out I think it's a kind of a great
non-traditional<00:03:27.380> punch<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:29.000> know<00:03:29.120> it's

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
non-traditional punch you know it's

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.490 
non-traditional punch you know it's
because<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.630> mezcal<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:29.989> not<00:03:30.170> one<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.380> those

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
because the mezcal is not one of those

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.550 
because the mezcal is not one of those
classic<00:03:31.250> ingredients<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.880> punches<00:03:32.470> but<00:03:33.470> it

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
classic ingredients and punches but it

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.660 
classic ingredients and punches but it
scales<00:03:33.859> up<00:03:33.980> really<00:03:34.220> easy<00:03:34.370> if<00:03:34.489> you're<00:03:34.549> gonna

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
scales up really easy if you're gonna
