00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 Hi, in this video, I'll make the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.320
 fall installation 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.130
 A civilian, I'm Rodrigo, and you're in the 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.130
 your draws 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.810
 the new civic is with original wheel for 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.599
 install the front caliper 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.119
 you will not have any problems but in 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.900
 rear caliper will require a lightweight 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 adaptation 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.350
 we give the first tire wheel 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.900
 you will find the brake caliper and it is 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.300
 on it you'll put the cover on it 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.449
 The cap is secured by 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 two clips the clips are 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.660
 into the channels of the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.400
 brake 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.400
 remove the cover 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.150
 spoils the tabs by pushing 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 final in box the latches in the channels 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.860
 lock tabs by pulling 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.160
 to the home position and place the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.960
 ready seat 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.850
 if it gets a little loose you do not need 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.330
 worrying she will not let go 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330
 or fall 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.730
 put the wheel and let's go 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730
 rear caliper 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.520
 remove the wheel in 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.920
 balance on the rear caliper is no such 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.290
 which is the brake assembly and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 can not be removed what we can 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.670
 do is an adaptation on the cover latch 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.189
 so that it fits into the future that is 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.170
 smaller than the channel for this is just 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.690
 cut the side of the lock slightly 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.960
 as shown in the example of the living 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.550
 the clamp on the clamp and lock in the same way 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.550
 which was made in the front caliper 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.790
 put the wheel and repeat the action on the other 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.790
 side 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.750
 remembering that this cover 15 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.400
 in the store all in parts I'll leave the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.750
