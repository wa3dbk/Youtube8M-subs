point anyway he's going to get caught so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.889 
point anyway he's going to get caught so
what<00:01:59.490> he's<00:01:59.580> got<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.789> do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.179> realize<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.720> wing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
what he's got to do is realize the wing

bite<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.970> elbows<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> he's<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.289> out<00:02:04.440> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
bite here is elbows so he's going out to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.240 
bite here is elbows so he's going out to
do<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> combined<00:02:05.869> take<00:02:06.869> away<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> blade<00:02:07.530> and

do a combined take away a blade and
impact<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> opponent<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.019> very<00:02:10.259> very

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
impact on to the opponent so very very

he can just what I started to other

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.690 
he can just what I started to other
stuff<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.340> fight<00:04:33.200> view<00:04:34.200> all<00:04:36.140> if<00:04:37.140> he's<00:04:37.350> there

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
stuff is fight view all if he's there

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.340 
stuff is fight view all if he's there
calories<00:04:38.700> for<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:38.910> way<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> can't<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:40.050> in

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
doing so advantages of weaker well he

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.450 
doing so advantages of weaker well he
wants<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.050> be<00:04:43.140> doing<00:04:43.470> if<00:04:43.800> indeed<00:04:44.130> anything
