00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
mw2 so let's make a system link game

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
mw2 so let's make a system link game
which<00:01:10.080> create<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> game<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> game<00:01:12.479> setup

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810

so you would put Xbox unlocks on yes and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.219 
so you would put Xbox unlocks on yes and
