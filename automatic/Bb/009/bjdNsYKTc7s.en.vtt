00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500

in corvallis just because the rumor mill
and<00:00:20.950> you<00:00:21.279> hope<00:00:21.610> to<00:00:21.670> think<00:00:21.970> that<00:00:22.300> maybe<00:00:22.450> that's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690

where<00:00:22.810> we<00:00:22.869> going<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.050> end<00:00:23.170> up<00:00:23.230> but<00:00:23.500> it<00:00:24.430> was

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
where we going to end up but it was

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.030 
where we going to end up but it was
pretty<00:00:24.790> nerve-wracking<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.720> our<00:00:26.500> players

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
pretty nerve-wracking and our players

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.620 
pretty nerve-wracking and our players
are<00:00:27.160> really<00:00:27.400> excited<00:00:27.670> obviously<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.480> was<00:00:28.600> a

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
are really excited obviously it was a

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.050 
are really excited obviously it was a
great<00:00:29.140> reaction<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.070> genuine<00:00:30.400> reaction<00:00:30.640> i

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
think that we were hopeful that this was

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.740 
think that we were hopeful that this was
going<00:00:33.489> to<00:00:33.550> be<00:00:33.610> what<00:00:33.790> happened<00:00:34.120> but<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:34.570> weren't

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
yeah I mean it just could be that could

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
yeah I mean it just could be that could
be<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
be it and so

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.550 
be it and so
that's<00:02:19.000> kind<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.270> my<00:02:19.390> mentality<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.320> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
that's kind of my mentality going in and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.010 
that's kind of my mentality going in and
I<00:02:20.740> think<00:02:21.190> for<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:21.970> other<00:02:22.180> seniors<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> as

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
I think for the other seniors it is as

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.020 
I think for the other seniors it is as
well<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:23.380> ice<00:02:23.980> last<00:02:24.250> time<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.580> gonna<00:02:24.640> put<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:24.940> a
