his own skill and ingenuity George in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.060 
his own skill and ingenuity George in
need<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.420> ID<00:01:50.659> issue<00:01:51.050> he<00:01:51.290> just<00:01:51.500> walks<00:01:51.710> into<00:01:51.920> his

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
need of ID issue he just walks into his

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.910 
need of ID issue he just walks into his
workshop<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.790> made<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.600> watch<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.680> that's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
workshop and made this watch and that's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800 
workshop and made this watch and that's
what's<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:55.610> unique<00:01:55.759> about<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.479> George's

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
what's so unique about all of George's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.170 
what's so unique about all of George's
pieces<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.740> opposed<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.190> washing<00:01:58.550> and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
pieces and is opposed to washing and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.570 
pieces and is opposed to washing and
each<00:01:59.360> one<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.810> he<00:01:59.960> made<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.290> unique<00:02:00.619> yeah<00:02:01.220> how

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
each one that he made is unique yeah how

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.370 
each one that he made is unique yeah how
many<00:02:01.820> pocket<00:02:02.360> watches<00:02:02.479> did<00:02:02.810> he<00:02:02.930> make<00:02:03.110> during

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
many pocket watches did he make during

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.469 
many pocket watches did he make during
his<00:02:03.530> life<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.520> think<00:02:04.550> M<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.060> memory<00:02:05.420> is

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
his life and I think M of memory is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.219 
his life and I think M of memory is
about<00:02:05.840> twenty<00:02:06.229> three<00:02:06.350> or<00:02:06.560> four<00:02:06.740> pieces<00:02:06.950> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
about twenty three or four pieces and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.100 
about twenty three or four pieces and
this<00:02:09.229> pieces<00:02:09.649> are<00:02:09.770> one-off<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:11.750> today

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
this pieces are one-off here today

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.770 
this pieces are one-off here today
there's<00:02:13.000> one<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> retrograde<00:02:14.570> our

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
there's one of the retrograde our

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.110 
there's one of the retrograde our
watches<00:02:15.380> which<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> real<00:02:16.400> signature<00:02:16.850> piece

coaxial schemas but he always wanted his
own<00:02:56.780> in-house<00:02:57.140> mechanism<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:59.200> started

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
own in-house mechanism and started

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.160 
own in-house mechanism and started
working<00:03:00.410> late<00:03:00.769> 2009<00:03:01.430> work<00:03:02.299> on<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.630> prototype

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
working late 2009 work on the prototype

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.570

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
and and this is a prototype piece that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.170 
and and this is a prototype piece that
we<00:03:08.570> completed<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:10.580> just<00:03:10.820> about<00:03:10.910> three<00:03:11.150> weeks

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
we completed it's just about three weeks

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.530 
we completed it's just about three weeks
before<00:03:11.450> George<00:03:11.840> passed<00:03:12.080> away<00:03:12.320> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
delivered the very first piece there's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.760 
delivered the very first piece there's
been<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> huge<00:03:22.270> project<00:03:23.530> getting<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:24.650> this

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
been a huge project getting to this

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.950 
been a huge project getting to this
stage<00:03:24.830> but<00:03:25.820> well<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.450> we're<00:03:26.570> making

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
stage but well because we're making

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.630 
stage but well because we're making
everything<00:03:27.200> in-house<00:03:27.650> yes<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.520> that

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
everything in-house yes with that

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.390 
everything in-house yes with that
section<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.920> balance<00:03:30.920> spring<00:03:31.160> and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
section to the balance spring and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.730 
section to the balance spring and
mainspring<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.270> on<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.570> jewels<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:33.590> a

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
mainspring and so on the jewels it's a

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.220 
mainspring and so on the jewels it's a
huge<00:03:34.280> undertaking<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:35.390> design<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> completely

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
huge undertaking to design a completely

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.850 
huge undertaking to design a completely
new<00:03:36.560> English<00:03:37.370> Daniels<00:03:38.240> caliber<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> very

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
important watch is the last watch the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.770 
important watch is the last watch the
George<00:03:41.690> designed

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
George designed

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.650 
George designed
yeah<00:03:44.560> very<00:03:44.800> very<00:03:45.250> very<00:03:46.180> nice<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.630> be
