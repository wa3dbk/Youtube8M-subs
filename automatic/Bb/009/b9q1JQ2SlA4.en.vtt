five<00:00:47.250> rules<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:48.120> been<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.870> wanted

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
five rules I've been like if you wanted

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
five rules I've been like if you wanted
five<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:50.129> optimal<00:00:50.760> body<00:00:50.969> composition<00:00:51.390> when

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
five for optimal body composition when

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.010 
five for optimal body composition when
it<00:00:52.020> comes<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.829> fact<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> safe<00:00:54.329> fat<00:00:54.600> refer

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
it comes to fact what a safe fat refer

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
it comes to fact what a safe fat refer
to<00:00:55.379> dietary<00:00:56.010> fat<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> fact<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.180> soon

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to dietary fat the fact that we can soon

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
to dietary fat the fact that we can soon
got<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> package<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.469> her<00:00:58.590> body<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.250> every

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
got the package on her body so every

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
got the package on her body so every
blend<00:01:00.649> has<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:02.010> variety<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> model<00:01:03.750> poly

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
blend has a variety of model poly

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
blend has a variety of model poly
unsaturated<00:01:04.610> fat<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.270> got<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> get

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
unsaturated fat so you really got to get

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320 
unsaturated fat so you really got to get
rid<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.049> fear<00:01:07.409> mentality<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.909> cannot

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
rid of that fear mentality of I cannot

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
rid of that fear mentality of I cannot
ever<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.930> saturated<00:01:10.560> fats<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.220> research

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
ever do saturated fats all the research

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
ever do saturated fats all the research
that<00:01:11.820> shows<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> saturated<00:01:12.840> fats<00:01:13.170> are

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that shows the saturated fats are

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
that shows the saturated fats are
unhealthy<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.130> when<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.970> linked<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:16.049> diet

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
unhealthy is when it's linked to a diet

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.609 
unhealthy is when it's linked to a diet
to<00:01:16.770> tying<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.490> process<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> identifying<00:01:19.170> foods
