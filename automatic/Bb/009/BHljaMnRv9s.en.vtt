00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
plugin so basically this is a dynamic

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.780 
plugin so basically this is a dynamic
like<00:00:40.260> market<00:00:40.770> type<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.190> where<00:00:41.219> basically

like market type thing where basically

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.180 
like market type thing where basically
it's<00:00:42.000> all<00:00:42.120> command<00:00:42.570> based<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.890> happens

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's all command based and what happens

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's all command based and what happens
is<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> buy<00:00:44.760> something<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.960> price<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is when you buy something the price so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
is when you buy something the price so
that<00:00:46.440> something<00:00:46.800> goes<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.120> everyone<00:00:48.510> and

that something goes up for everyone and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
that something goes up for everyone and
when<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.559> sell<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> privacy<00:00:50.579> goes<00:00:50.700> down

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
when you sell it the privacy goes down

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
when you sell it the privacy goes down
for<00:00:51.239> everyone<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.539> what<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> creates

our<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:08.940> example<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:10.009> dynamic<00:02:11.009> prices<00:02:11.430> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
our little example for dynamic prices so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.990 
our little example for dynamic prices so
i'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.110> ahead<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
i'm going to go ahead and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.480 
i'm going to go ahead and
by<00:02:14.500> 14<00:02:15.500> mm<00:02:15.800> x<00:02:15.920> 64<00:02:16.550> snow<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.460> was

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
cents now it's something that's

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.129 
cents now it's something that's
interesting<00:05:33.030> that<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.389> should<00:05:33.419> know<00:05:34.110> that

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
interesting that you should know that

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.370 
interesting that you should know that
they<00:05:34.380> should<00:05:34.620> pay<00:05:35.159> attention<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.550> is<00:05:35.820> on<00:05:36.380> we

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
they should pay attention to is on we

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.620 
they should pay attention to is on we
sold<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.190> we<00:05:38.220> bought<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.909> same<00:05:39.150> amount<00:05:39.330> like

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
sold and we bought the same amount like

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.050 
sold and we bought the same amount like
we<00:05:39.750> did<00:05:39.930> not<00:05:40.110> create<00:05:40.560> more<00:05:40.949> snow<00:05:41.310> we<00:05:41.820> bought

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
we did not create more snow we bought

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.210 
we did not create more snow we bought
and<00:05:42.330> we<00:05:42.419> sold<00:05:42.630> what<00:05:42.990> we<00:05:43.139> apart<00:05:43.800> from<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.010> mark

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
and we sold what we apart from the mark

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.909 
and we sold what we apart from the mark
from<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.030> world<00:05:45.389> market<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.650> price<00:05:46.889> is

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
from the world market and the price is

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.830 
from the world market and the price is
higher<00:05:47.220> than<00:05:47.699> what<00:05:48.060> was<00:05:48.240> before<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:49.590> um

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
higher than what was before so um

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.170 
higher than what was before so um
basically<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.139> means<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:52.590> there<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.490> a

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
basically that means that there is a

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.800 
basically that means that there is a
different<00:05:54.720> ratio<00:05:54.900> for<00:05:55.650> the<00:05:56.460> price<00:05:56.810> changing

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
different ratio for the price changing

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.439 
different ratio for the price changing
when<00:05:58.259> you<00:05:58.409> buy<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:58.979> when<00:05:59.070> you<00:05:59.159> sell<00:05:59.460> so<00:06:00.330> what

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
when you buy and when you sell so what

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.060 
when you buy and when you sell so what
that<00:06:00.479> does<00:06:00.780> is<00:06:00.810> that<00:06:01.110> is<00:06:01.380> that<00:06:01.409> that's<00:06:01.770> what

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
that does is that is that that's what

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.899 
that does is that is that that's what
makes<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.669> a<00:06:03.169> dynamic<00:06:04.400> plug-in<00:06:05.400> because<00:06:05.699> it

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
makes this a dynamic plug-in because it

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.290 
makes this a dynamic plug-in because it
reflects<00:06:06.389> supply<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.080> demand<00:06:07.199> and<00:06:08.030> in<00:06:09.030> this

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
reflects supply and demand and in this

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.510 
reflects supply and demand and in this
way<00:06:09.539> we'll<00:06:09.960> have<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.139> more<00:06:10.380> realistic<00:06:10.740> price<00:06:11.220> on

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
way we'll have a more realistic price on

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.529 
way we'll have a more realistic price on
all<00:06:11.789> of<00:06:12.690> our<00:06:12.750> blocks<00:06:13.139> like<00:06:13.530> stone<00:06:14.340> and

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
all of our blocks like stone and

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.990 
all of our blocks like stone and
cobblestone<00:06:15.539> and<00:06:15.990> we<00:06:16.800> hope<00:06:17.039> that<00:06:17.070> this<00:06:17.610> makes

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
cobblestone and we hope that this makes

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.860 
cobblestone and we hope that this makes
a<00:06:19.220> this<00:06:20.220> stops<00:06:20.550> people<00:06:20.940> from<00:06:21.120> setting<00:06:21.630> like

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
a this stops people from setting like

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.760 
a this stops people from setting like
obscene<00:06:22.440> prices<00:06:23.009> for<00:06:23.430> goods<00:06:23.789> in<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:25.229> actual

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
obscene prices for goods in the actual

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.600 
obscene prices for goods in the actual
physical<00:06:26.610> player<00:06:27.030> market<00:06:27.979> so<00:06:28.979> yeah<00:06:29.310> this
