00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.230 

so<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.990> lot<00:00:13.400> about<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.610> contrast

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
so I think a lot about the contrast

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.320 
so I think a lot about the contrast
between<00:00:15.590> venality<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.250> wonder<00:00:17.760> between

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
between venality and wonder between

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.670 
between venality and wonder between
disengagement<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.510> radiant<00:00:21.680> ecstasy

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
disengagement and radiant ecstasy

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.000 
disengagement and radiant ecstasy
between<00:00:23.250> being<00:00:23.869> unaffected<00:00:24.869> by<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
between being unaffected by the here and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.189 
between being unaffected by the here and
now<00:00:26.960> being<00:00:27.960> absolutely<00:00:28.939> ravished

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
now being absolutely ravished

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.690 
now being absolutely ravished
emotionally<00:00:31.199> by<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.219> think<00:00:32.399> one<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
emotionally by it and I think one of the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.459 
emotionally by it and I think one of the
problems<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:33.120> human<00:00:33.390> beings<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.840> mental

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
problems we're human beings is mental

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.799 
problems we're human beings is mental
habits<00:00:34.829> once<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.520> create<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> comfort<00:00:36.390> zone<00:00:36.420> we

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
habits once we create a comfort zone we

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.780 
habits once we create a comfort zone we
rarely<00:00:37.079> step<00:00:37.469> outside<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.160> comfort<00:00:38.219> zone

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
rarely step outside of that comfort zone

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
rarely step outside of that comfort zone
but<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> consequence<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
but the consequence of that is a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.369 
but the consequence of that is a
phenomenon<00:00:41.190> known<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.399> hedonic<00:00:41.879> adaptation

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation
over<00:00:43.379> stimulation<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.520> kind<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
over stimulation to the same kind of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.119 
over stimulation to the same kind of
thing<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> same<00:00:45.809> stimuli<00:00:46.469> again<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> again

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
thing the same stimuli again and again

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.090 
thing the same stimuli again and again
and<00:00:47.280> again<00:00:47.460> renders<00:00:48.210> says<00:00:48.690> stimuli<00:00:49.200> invisible
