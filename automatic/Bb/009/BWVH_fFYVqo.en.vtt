something that all the legendary weapons
had<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.929> common<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> common<00:02:11.940> thread<00:02:12.150> was

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
had in common and this common thread was

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.550 
had in common and this common thread was
actually<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> Oracle

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
actually the Oracle

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280 
actually the Oracle
disruptor<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.310> what<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.790> does<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.420> very

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
disruptor and what that does is very

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.199 
disruptor and what that does is very
very<00:02:16.530> obvious<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.400> weapon<00:02:17.760> deals<00:02:17.910> bonus

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
very obvious this weapon deals bonus

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.530 
very obvious this weapon deals bonus
damage<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.870> Oracle's<00:02:19.349> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.920> vault<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.310> glass

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
damage to Oracle's in the vault of glass

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.820 
damage to Oracle's in the vault of glass
so<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:21.930> pretty<00:02:22.380> much<00:02:22.530> common

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
so it would make pretty much common

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.960 
so it would make pretty much common
sense<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.550> where<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.849> would

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
sense that this would be where you would

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
sense that this would be where you would
find<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.569> types<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.959> weapons<00:02:25.349> as<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.160> turns

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
find these types of weapons as it turns

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.940 
find these types of weapons as it turns
out<00:02:26.520> there<00:02:26.730> was<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> very<00:02:27.330> similar<00:02:27.690> theme<00:02:28.140> with

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
the armor as well you could find themes

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.790
