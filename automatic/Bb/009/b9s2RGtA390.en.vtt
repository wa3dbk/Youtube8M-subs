- I was just going to show you kind of a

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.289 
- I was just going to show you kind of a
variable<00:00:03.780> cam<00:00:04.049> timing<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.730> little<00:00:05.730> bit<00:00:05.850> for

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
variable cam timing a little bit for

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.089 
variable cam timing a little bit for
Ford<00:00:07.610> couple<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.469> had<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.530> remark<00:00:10.950> about

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
Ford couple you I had a remark about

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.209 
Ford couple you I had a remark about
switching<00:00:11.880> from<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> FL<00:00:12.300> 500<00:00:12.900> filter<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
switching from the FL 500 filter to the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.980 
switching from the FL 500 filter to the
824<00:00:14.759> more<00:00:14.910> full<00:00:15.179> but<00:00:15.420> they<00:00:15.509> didn't<00:00:15.750> want<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
824 more full but they didn't want to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.029 
824 more full but they didn't want to
adjust<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.859> for<00:00:17.420> because<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.570> oil<00:00:18.630> pressure<00:00:19.039> or

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
adjust it for because of oil pressure or

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.740 
adjust it for because of oil pressure or
in<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.220> variable<00:00:20.550> cam<00:00:20.699> timing<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> was

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in the variable cam timing and I was

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.439 
in the variable cam timing and I was
going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> show<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:23.000> mean<00:00:24.000> always<00:00:24.300> use

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
going to show you that I mean always use

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.000 
going to show you that I mean always use
the<00:00:24.570> right<00:00:24.660> filter<00:00:26.359> it's<00:00:27.859> what's<00:00:28.859> recommended

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the right filter it's what's recommended

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.429 
the right filter it's what's recommended
for<00:00:29.490> reason<00:00:29.849> there's<00:00:30.660> enough<00:00:30.900> hole<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
for reason there's enough hole for the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.729 
for reason there's enough hole for the
engine<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.969> all<00:00:32.969> rpm<00:00:33.480> ranges<00:00:33.870> 8:20<00:00:34.469> my<00:00:34.559> full

you see your get your knee crank gear
comes<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.150> chain<00:01:18.660> runs<00:01:18.840> around<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
comes up chain runs around this to this

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.670 
comes up chain runs around this to this
head<00:01:20.600> your<00:01:21.600> left<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.260> you're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.590> to

head your left side and you're going to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.210 
head your left side and you're going to
take<00:01:22.800> side<00:01:23.330> for<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> cams<00:01:25.040> running<00:01:26.040> those

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
take side for the cams running those

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
take side for the cams running those
valves<00:01:26.460> down<00:01:26.760> there<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.300> Ford's<00:01:27.720> variable

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
valves down there for Ford's variable

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.250 
valves down there for Ford's variable
cam<00:01:28.170> timing<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.650> rehear<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.080> cam

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
cam timing this rehear see this is a cam

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.840 
cam timing this rehear see this is a cam
fazer<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.420> valve<00:01:33.750> cover<00:01:35.330> which<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:37.850> forgot

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
fazer on the valve cover which I forgot

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.770 
fazer on the valve cover which I forgot
where<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> put<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.660> sorry<00:01:41.390> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> valve<00:01:42.690> cover

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
where I put so sorry on the valve cover

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
where I put so sorry on the valve cover
oh<00:01:45.290> that's<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> month<00:01:47.479> returned

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
oh that's right I got a month returned

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.840 
oh that's right I got a month returned
in<00:01:49.550> any<00:01:50.550> way<00:01:50.700> there's<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.940> little<00:01:51.060> actuator

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
in any way there's a little actuator

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.359 
in any way there's a little actuator
when<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> thing<00:01:54.150> needs<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:55.020> power

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
when this thing needs a more power

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.420 
when this thing needs a more power
basically<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:57.270> goes<00:01:57.479> by<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.869> hits<00:01:58.050> the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
basically the this goes by and hits the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
basically the this goes by and hits the
signal<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.550> can<00:01:59.700> actually<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.570> came

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
signal so I can actually kind of came

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.340 
signal so I can actually kind of came
position<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:03.149> got<00:02:03.300> three<00:02:03.539> years<00:02:03.660> here<00:02:03.990> one

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
position it you got three years here one

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.469 
position it you got three years here one
what<00:02:04.649> happens<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.130> when<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.340> engine<00:02:06.300> start

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
what happens is when you engine start

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.590 
what happens is when you engine start
spinning<00:02:06.660> faster<00:02:06.780> needs<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.530> lift<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:07.950> rpm

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
spinning faster needs more lift more rpm

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.880 
spinning faster needs more lift more rpm
well<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.869> it's<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> match<00:02:10.350> more<00:02:10.560> rpm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
well you know it's to match more rpm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
well you know it's to match more rpm
these<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.670> more<00:02:11.910> powers<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.420> cam<00:02:12.630> phaser

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
these with more powers this cam phaser

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.540 
these with more powers this cam phaser
it<00:02:13.050> still<00:02:13.260> starts<00:02:13.710> filled<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.100> oil

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it still starts filled with oil

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.580 
it still starts filled with oil
I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.540> weighted<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.020> starts<00:02:16.319> kind<00:02:16.530> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I think it's weighted and starts kind of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.800 
I think it's weighted and starts kind of
advancing<00:02:17.600> timing<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.380> gear<00:02:20.810> so

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
advancing timing just on this gear so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.559 
advancing timing just on this gear so
because<00:02:22.500> also<00:02:22.590> always<00:02:22.890> stay<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.069> same<00:02:23.569> but

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
because also always stay the same but

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.680 
because also always stay the same but
your<00:02:24.720> intake<00:02:25.020> might<00:02:25.440> change<00:02:25.770> or<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> couple

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
your intake might change or a couple

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.080 
your intake might change or a couple
degrees<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.080> duration<00:02:28.610> which<00:02:29.610> allows<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
degrees and duration which allows it to

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.350 
degrees and duration which allows it to
get<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.020> different<00:02:31.680> timing<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.459> more

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
get a little different timing and more

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.290 
get a little different timing and more
power<00:02:33.569> at<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> higher<00:02:33.930> rpm<00:02:34.350> range<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:36.209> that's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
power at the higher rpm range so that's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.000 
power at the higher rpm range so that's
forwards<00:02:36.720> variable<00:02:37.020> cam<00:02:37.140> timing<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:37.800> like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
forwards variable cam timing now like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
forwards variable cam timing now like
remark<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.610> had<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:38.970> new<00:02:39.120> 500<00:02:39.569> Mustangs

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
remark I had was on the new 500 Mustangs

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.809 
remark I had was on the new 500 Mustangs
with<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.410> twin<00:02:40.709> independent<00:02:41.010> variable<00:02:41.670> cam

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
with the twin independent variable cam

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.210 
with the twin independent variable cam
timing<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.480> that's<00:02:43.200> when<00:02:43.350> both<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.860> these<00:02:43.950> cam

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
timing and that's when both of these cam

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.089 
timing and that's when both of these cam
gears<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:47.720> came<00:02:48.720> phasers<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.319> them

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
gears have came phasers on them

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.220 
gears have came phasers on them
so<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.790> each<00:02:50.879> side<00:02:51.150> there's<00:02:51.480> one<00:02:51.659> phaser<00:02:51.900> two

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so for each side there's one phaser two

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.550 
so for each side there's one phaser two
phaser<00:02:52.469> three<00:02:53.069> four<00:02:54.139> you're<00:02:55.139> seriously

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
phaser three four you're seriously

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.449 
phaser three four you're seriously
research<00:02:56.689> and<00:02:57.709> they<00:02:58.709> did<00:02:58.829> one<00:02:58.950> mess<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.219> oil

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
research and they did one mess of oil

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.220 
research and they did one mess of oil
pressure<00:02:59.639> for<00:03:00.980> um<00:03:02.629> that<00:03:03.629> particular<00:03:04.079> reason

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
pressure for um that particular reason

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.879 
pressure for um that particular reason
and<00:03:04.849> mmm<00:03:05.849> z77<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:07.200> remark<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.680> me<00:03:07.769> that

and mmm z77 also remark to me that

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.610 
and mmm z77 also remark to me that
that's<00:03:08.340> why<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.579> decided<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.969> do<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.209> video

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that's why I decided to do this video

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.339 
that's why I decided to do this video
just<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.709> kind<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.950> show<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.159> guys<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:13.260> know

your moved off add the heads off one
Friday

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.030 

basically<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.400> is<00:04:00.019> use<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.169> right<00:04:01.349> oil

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
basically this is use the right oil

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.649 
basically this is use the right oil
filter<00:04:02.340> I'm<00:04:02.939> not<00:04:03.090> saying<00:04:03.269> these<00:04:03.359> failed

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
filter I'm not saying these failed

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.839 
filter I'm not saying these failed
because<00:04:03.780> they<00:04:03.959> use<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.199> wrong<00:04:04.349> one<00:04:04.759> could<00:04:05.759> be

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
because they use the wrong one could be

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.369 
because they use the wrong one could be
a<00:04:05.879> possibility<00:04:06.419> but<00:04:06.540> there<00:04:06.659> actually<00:04:07.019> was<00:04:07.169> in

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
a possibility but there actually was in

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.210 
a possibility but there actually was in
eighth<00:04:07.530> twenty<00:04:07.709> on<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:09.389> engine<00:04:10.040> before<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
eighth twenty on this engine before I

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.259 
eighth twenty on this engine before I
started<00:04:11.519> working<00:04:11.639> on<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.970> kind<00:04:15.209> of

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
started working on it so just kind of

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.399 
started working on it so just kind of
hope<00:04:15.419> this<00:04:15.569> helps<00:04:15.780> yeah<00:04:18.049> because<00:04:19.049> otherwise

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
hope this helps yeah because otherwise
