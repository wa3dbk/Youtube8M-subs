00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.019
 hello taking from whom I always have a 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.200
 new way to minecraft is about the 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.760
 mod the last short you will never nit is 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.790
 a mod that will only add us 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.610
 a sword and its improved versions and 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.960
 as the title of the mod says 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.870
 you are not going to want to craft and earrings 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.190
 because it's over power totally worth of 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.840
 every way I'm going to do the review is 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.250
 compatible on servers so well 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.420
 good can be used to do some 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.930
 combat to try the best 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.610
 armors too and nothing I hope you 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.380
 like I'll leave in the description of 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.330
 video the link to the official page by 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.160
 if you want to download it so said 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.660
 this first of all we're going to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.060
 need I'm going to remove this from here 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.520
 is going to be one of two or crafter us this 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.190
 block or kill the dragon of good and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.710
 get the egg in some way is worth 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.989
 get it and so we can use it to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.579
 the crafter of the sword if we do not want 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.620
 kill the dragon of good we can 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.450
 make us this buy be this 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.220
 compressed star and to make it 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.900
 we're going to need four stars from 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.780
 fridge so we're going to have to 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.970
 four times when taking good care once 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.910
 that we have this we will be able to move 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.400
 We already have our back as you see we have this 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.200
 that would be the basic and ten more levels and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.020
 finally we would have this here that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 is the bear that is called bear to make 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.580
 this first one we are going to need this 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 dragon the dragon egg and four 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.800
 Diamond blocks like I told you if 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.360
 we want to spend the egg 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.540
 we are going to need this star 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.910
 compressed 7 of obsidian and a block of 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 diamond so you know and we're going to 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.510
 make us the first sword as you see is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.060
 rank 1 but it's already brutal ago 1,600 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.030
 damage and we will be able to improve it for 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 do the 2 that makes 2400 of the year we're going to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 need here the 1 and again four 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.780
 diamond blocks to make it three 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.090
 let's put the two and again four 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.190
 blocks to make the 4 we put the 34 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.940
 diamond blocks and so all are worth 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.479
 as you see thousand 600 of the year 2400 3 thousand 204 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.259
 thousand four thousand 805 thousand 606 thousand 407 thousand 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 208 thousand 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.930
 1800 and we have the last of all that is 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.659
 the really the last show you will and berni 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.099
 who does this barbarity of harm is not 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.620
 nor how much is it but surely they will be 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.769
 thousands of trillions of damage and for 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.230
 create it we need the one in rank 10 and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.060
 again 8 diamond blocks of the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.220
 true that I think it was to get to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.959
 level 10 at least we need more than 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.329
 500 diamonds so if we are playing 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.269
 in survival without mods is pretty 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.569
 complicated or quite long to get 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.220
 which they will do apart from this damage 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.470
 I 'm going to place it right now we can 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.180
 attack and we will do that damage you see that 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.250
 here is one there is a something that we are going to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.409
 killing a tap is normal but if 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.690
 we right click what we're going to 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.049
 to do is to throw a diamond because 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.450
 it's level 1 ok you're going to see op and it creates us 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.579
 a ray in this that is a lightning bolt and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.480
 let's throw another voucher now you two 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.420
 times and as you can see, we are moving forward 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.459
 very well let's try let's try 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.590
 is also level 10 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.519
 at level 10 and this one here that is the bear 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.319
 and really, the difference is the 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.569
 damage is worth everything else does everything 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.099
 exactly the same as another of the things that 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.860
 I wanted to teach and I will put a 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.690
 moment in survival vale is that 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 any of these swords from 1 to 10 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.569
 they are not going to be spent and we are going to 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.459
 can use them to mine for as a 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.530
 ax so we can be here that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.810
 this is level 1 and you see how 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.700
 we start to get wood is 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.739
 very fast we could use it too 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.810
 like a pickaxe like a shovel so I already 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.760
 you are seeing is worth the speed at which 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.590
 we are watching you see that I am 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.870
 playing in survival vale but good 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.579
 I'm pretty much like I said, that's why it's 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.440
 the name we will not want to create us 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.329
 another sword and possibly no other 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.849
 tool because with this we are going to 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.319
 have enough to do will make us 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.379
 some test 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.580
 I'm going to call the wing the same 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.980
 quickly invoke some good dragon 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.710
 and first of all I wanted to tell you that each 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.870
 diamond diamond every stroke makes 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.940
 same damage as the sword so when 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.190
 that diamond hits someone in this case 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 will do 1,600 of damage and hits you is 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.660
 Well now this amount and if it hits 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.540
 will be 8,800 damage so saying that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.590
 let's summon a let's place 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:33.520
 samón samón well and sell dragon vale 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.350
 sell dragon perfect because nothing here what 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.510
 we have how to see this survival has already 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.830
 I broke the ground a bit to come 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.190
 to attack as you see I have also in 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.440
 armor 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.930
 but we're going to launch him and as you see 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.210
 with a diamond we just killed him 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.240
 an authentic one is an authentic past 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.070
 so then you are already seeing it 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.510
 ok let's get here all the 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.430
 experience as you see how I have not 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.380
 10 killed in does not come out here because this 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.200
 if I get in right now we would go to 10 to 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.060
 backwards and right now I'm going to go back to 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.800
 invoke and what we are going to do is going to be 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.720
 kill him with a touch with the sword not with 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.910
 a diamond but with a stroke is worth 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.680
 Let's give one espadazo and and 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.330
 we have here again we just got it 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.340
 kill so imagine that if the dragon 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.950
 of the 10 we killed him with a touch then the 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.710
 rest of normal and current modes 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.560
 also so said that we're going to 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.440
 try to kill a tide widder 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.520
 they invoked widder 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.510
 and we are going to make ham and 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.120
 widder 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.930
 uy 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.800
 that's the perfect box very well 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.660
 here we have it is already coming from here 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.470
 do not dare this dare to come know 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.380
 that is going to die not because it is already as you see 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.750
 I managed to give it to me I'm going to put it here 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.150
 this life was not enough to give him but 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.130
 I shot as you have seen with a 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.449
 diamond and I've killed him with a touch like that 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.790
 that as I say they will also invoke 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.710
 lightning bolts and lightning bolts and this is 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.169
 the way the truth is that it is very op 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.000
 It is very or p but good as it is for 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.590
 servers can also be used 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.330
 they can modify the damage equally from the 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.400
 configuration 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.500
 and nothing has said this I hope that I have 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.080
 liked any doubt or suggestion 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.840
 Comment you tell me by the way 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.210
 sword is not able to break to see it anymore 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.060
 I've tried it here, it's worth what we could 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.849
 prove you can not break it like that 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.849
 that that fish but it is not so much both 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.780
 so nothing guys said this I'm going to 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.520
 dismiss I hope you liked it 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:38.389
 Any doubt or suggestion or comment 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.389
 you tell me until later goodbye
