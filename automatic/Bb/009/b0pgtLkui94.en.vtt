 answers from one hour to three 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.000
 days whether it has been accepted has been 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.490
 rejected will receive a reply like this 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.110

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.550
 request of partners with beat cases pain 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.619
 you will have to fill in the form and in 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.240
 brief will have the answer if you've 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.959
 applied before and has not received 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.880
 answer still neither accepted nor 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.660
 contract or anything fill in the form 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.920
 as well 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.230
 It is recommended that you fill in the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.610
 form if you applied before if you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.830
 have accepted but have not yet received 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.450
 the contract or partner activation 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.950
 It is advisable that you continue to wait 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.600
 because the safest thing is that in the end you 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.160
 come but if you think it has happened 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.820
 too much time and still not arrive 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.680
 contact me via twitter because no 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.260
 contact me via messages 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.940
 youtube or via skype because that 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.400
 I gave them a very heavy those networks 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.050
 I have very heavy and sometimes already 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.180
 context because I can not answer the a 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.130
 all so the network that more clear 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.140
 I have by far is twitter out there 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.870
 I see it for sure I will answer sure to everything 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.090
 what you ask me so if yes 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.190
 you are in this case we will try 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.960
 solve it on twitter and if I see that 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.550
 the thing gets complicated or must be done 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.590
 something else or it would be added to sky 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.210
 we will do what we have to do but 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.920
 if you think it's been too long 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.050
 with too much time I mean three 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 months four months and still has not 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.650
 come the contract the activation then 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 you have me, we will try to solve it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.240
 and the last case if you have sent any 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.730
 once the request but you have been rejected 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.740
 for something to have the rise in evil 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.900
 been for anything that you have 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.710
 rejected of copyright and you have decided 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.860
 delete 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.120
 will reactivate or anything that good 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.830
 you think your channel is already in good 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.010
 been what you have to do is not 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.690
 send the form because when they take 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.490
 your data will see that you are already 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.750
 registered and they will simply discard you 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.030
 the data what you have to do 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.010
 It is also to contact me via twitter 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.770
 as real see what he told me I'll leave 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.070
 in the video description contact 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.330
 via twitter and there we will talk if I 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.400
 I would have to put in another way 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.400
 different so they do not rule out your 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.160
 data but so to speak or the os 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.440
 update it and so surely because 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.630
 could receive the partner if it is already 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.130
 meet all the requirements and ones 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.930
 kids, so nothing here, the video 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.880
 all of these are more or less the cases that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.520
 tend to occur and if you have any other 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.200
 doubt or any other situation that 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.850
 ask me or whatever you can you can 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.470

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.890
