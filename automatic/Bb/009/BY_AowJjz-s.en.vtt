00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.070
 very good we are in a new video of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.990
 a boxing for the youtube channel of pc 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.480
 box and this time we're going to teach the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.100
 keyboard of the Templar range 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.560
 the weapon model of the aerocool house 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.300
 let's teach a keyboard or a keyboard 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.830
 especially gaming 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.290
 you will see it with the design 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.290
 features the keys 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.420
 a little bit the house 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:47.640
 as you can see it is a templar model 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.890
 yet all it designed from the range 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.730
 of the Templars as everything that has 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 done now aerocool for that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.950
 for its range of gaming and we will teach 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.520
 the foosball of the keyboard for you to see 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.520
 the size 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.100
 The content of the box is 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.400
 a little manual on how to change the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.450
 keys that I do what I will explain 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.710
 and we will do it so you can see them 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.710
 the music of keys 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 i 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 and to change the keys 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440
 has different different types of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 keys so we can change the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.890
 directional arrows 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.990
 the letters for example we can also 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.110
 change the typical w 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.310
 s that are the movement in the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.310
 shooters and other games 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.440
 and now 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.090
 we'll start with the cable 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.310
 It is a connector 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.640
 plating is not worth it improves the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.640
 connectivity 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.440
 and the keyboard we have it here we see go 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.860
 well the multimedia keys on the sides 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.140
 is a keyboard that has to pause the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.320
 music go up and down the volume mutate the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.060
 volume has here for the typical open 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.540
 the mail open the browser open the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.540
 calculator 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.890
 we will connect it also since it has 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 illumination 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.090
 i 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.840
 their masters 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.840
 and turn off the light right away 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 let's see what the lights 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 we have the lighting 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.200
 is a red that covers the entire keyboard of 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.250
 tip to tip that will facilitate us to 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.250
 find the keys 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.290
 at night when it's dark 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 well we turn on the light and we're going to 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.170
 proceed to change the keys to 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.770
 let's change the keys for example 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.980
 of address here that is the most 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.670
 common to use and we see that with this 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.880
 tool is as simple as 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.960
 Introduce 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.570
 and extract 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.670
 as simple as they have done 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.630
 expressly for all types of 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.420
 users do not need 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.430
 know a lot about computing or have 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.110
 a lot of control with the hardware 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.959
 it is simply with the tools to 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.440
 we take them out and then we introduce the 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.980
 w 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.980
 well we will remove 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 d 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.169
 you have the manual that explains it 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.069
 bit 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.499
 but good when you see this 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:39.029
 tool and the keys almost almost 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.029
 You can intuit how it works 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.099
 we have the a 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.280
 more change still if you see what is the 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.280
 result 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.790
 and this would be the result has the 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.790
 different touch 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.800
 so when he knows two we look 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.780
 the arrow keys will facilitate us 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.230
 homework 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.280
 if quickly valencina mollema 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.650
 right away we found the keys 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.660
 similar address 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.160
 it's mainly that function too 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.270
 we can change as we said before 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.310
 the arrow keys the ones here 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.850
 that would be the four that we have 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.850
 remaining 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.250
 and it would be the result that we have 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.250
 in the box 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.860
 It should be noted that it is a keyboard 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:48.099
 economic is a keyboard that 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.169
 the first price will not cost us much and 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.960
 with a little we can have a good 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.150
 gaming keyboard and up to here our 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.610
 our boxing and a little review of 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.139
 Templar's keyboard am 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.139
 thank you very much in this other day
