00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
let's see 9.5 and a half because this

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.920 
let's see 9.5 and a half because this
shoe<00:03:04.940> has<00:03:05.440> real<00:03:06.440> potential<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.400> makes<00:03:07.930> maybe

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
shoe has real potential it makes maybe

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.539 
shoe has real potential it makes maybe
it's<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.530> thought<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.280> makes<00:03:10.400> you

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
it's just the thought that it makes you

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's just the thought that it makes you
faster<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.299> does<00:03:11.780> make<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.049> faster<00:03:12.380> it

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
faster but it does make you faster it

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.400 
faster but it does make you faster it
makes<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.549> shoot<00:03:13.850> higher<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.540> used<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.170> shoot

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
makes you shoot higher I used to shoot

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.069 
makes you shoot higher I used to shoot
and<00:03:15.680> just<00:03:16.010> go<00:03:16.160> like<00:03:16.190> low<00:03:16.670> ground<00:03:16.970> but<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.780> if<00:03:17.959> I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
and just go like low ground but now if I

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.100 
and just go like low ground but now if I
shoot<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.470> goes<00:03:18.680> really<00:03:18.920> high<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.989> know
