you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.789> if<00:01:44.880> we'll<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.179> I<00:01:45.359> mean<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.810> not

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
you know if we'll see I mean it's not

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.209 
you know if we'll see I mean it's not
really<00:01:46.109> low<00:01:46.350> gaining<00:01:46.679> weight<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.039> more

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
really low gaining weight it's more

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.069 
really low gaining weight it's more
about<00:01:47.429> getting<00:01:47.549> stronger<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.389> putting

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
about getting stronger and putting

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.050 
about getting stronger and putting
muscle<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.859> things<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.280> change<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.909> my

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
muscle on so things will change right my

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
muscle on so things will change right my
body<00:01:51.270> composition<00:01:51.689> might<00:01:52.079> change<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:52.499> that's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
body composition might change and that's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.279 
body composition might change and that's
fine<00:01:52.889> if<00:01:53.069> I<00:01:53.189> only<00:01:53.310> hit<00:01:53.969> 195<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.899> everything

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
fine if I only hit 195 but everything

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.629 
fine if I only hit 195 but everything
changes<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:55.770> they<00:01:55.859> get<00:01:56.009> leaner<00:01:56.249> and<00:01:56.429> more

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
changes and they get leaner and more

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.190 
changes and they get leaner and more
mascara<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.209> I'll<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.450> totally<00:01:57.630> happy<00:01:58.079> with

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that it's less work when it's time to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.300 
that it's less work when it's time to
cut<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.179> so<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.679> plan<00:02:01.859> I'm<00:02:02.219> going

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.830 
was like a 10 point something inch
screen<00:04:48.550> or<00:04:48.730> something<00:04:49.060> like<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.660> wasn't

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
screen or something like that it wasn't

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.630 
screen or something like that it wasn't
very<00:04:49.990> big<00:04:50.170> and<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:51.100> could<00:04:51.250> use<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.520> as<00:04:51.580> a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
very big and you could use it as a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.310 
very big and you could use it as a
tablet<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.390> had<00:04:52.540> a<00:04:52.570> keyboard<00:04:52.990> which<00:04:53.200> is

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
tablet and it had a keyboard which is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.980 
tablet and it had a keyboard which is
almost<00:04:53.560> full<00:04:53.920> size<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:55.120> theory<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.720> looked

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
almost full size and in theory it looked

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.590 
almost full size and in theory it looked
so<00:04:56.290> promising<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.520> really<00:04:58.060> wanted<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.540> to

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
so promising and I really wanted it to

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.010 
so promising and I really wanted it to
work<00:04:58.860> but<00:04:59.860> at<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.070> end<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.430> day<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:01.900> know

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
work but at the end of the day you know

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.780 
work but at the end of the day you know
because<00:05:02.290> it's<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.740> scaled-down<00:05:03.190> Windows

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
because it's a scaled-down Windows

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.400 
because it's a scaled-down Windows
machine<00:05:04.180> with<00:05:04.450> a<00:05:04.480> scaled-down<00:05:04.990> windows

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
machine with a scaled-down windows

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.230 
machine with a scaled-down windows
processor<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.160> really<00:05:06.490> couldn't<00:05:06.760> handle<00:05:07.090> it

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
processor it really couldn't handle it

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.000 
processor it really couldn't handle it
it<00:05:07.600> didn't<00:05:07.990> have<00:05:08.110> enough<00:05:08.140> drive<00:05:08.560> space<00:05:08.830> as

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
it didn't have enough drive space as

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.220 
it didn't have enough drive space as
soon<00:05:09.160> as<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.370> did<00:05:09.670> the<00:05:09.760> Windows<00:05:10.090> updates<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.750> as

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
soon as I did the Windows updates and as

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.720 
soon as I did the Windows updates and as
soon<00:05:11.410> as<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.560> added<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.890> few<00:05:12.070> programs<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.670> was

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
soon as I added a few programs it was

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.390 
soon as I added a few programs it was
full<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.450> tried<00:05:13.810> reallocating<00:05:14.560> where<00:05:15.280> to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
full and I tried reallocating where to

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.010 
full and I tried reallocating where to
store<00:05:15.670> some<00:05:15.970> of<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.120> memory<00:05:16.570> so<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.840> could

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
store some of that memory so I could

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.230 
store some of that memory so I could
maybe<00:05:17.230> um<00:05:17.530> actually<00:05:18.190> download<00:05:18.700> applications

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
maybe um actually download applications

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.430 
maybe um actually download applications
over<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.420> memory<00:05:19.660> card<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.080> just<00:05:20.260> totally

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
over the memory card and I just totally

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.650 
over the memory card and I just totally
burned<00:05:21.310> out<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.550> system<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:22.030> reinstalled

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
burned out the system I reinstalled

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.840 
burned out the system I reinstalled
everything<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.620> was<00:05:23.740> a<00:05:23.770> time<00:05:24.040> behind<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.610> time

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
everything it was a time behind the time

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.060 
everything it was a time behind the time
vampire<00:05:25.390> for<00:05:25.660> me<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:25.990> wasted<00:05:26.680> a<00:05:26.770> lot<00:05:26.800> of<00:05:26.950> time

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
vampire for me I wasted a lot of time

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.650 
vampire for me I wasted a lot of time
using<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:27.970> at<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.240> end<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.450> the<00:05:28.510> day<00:05:28.630> I

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
using it and at the end of the day I

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.350 
using it and at the end of the day I
didn't<00:05:28.990> use<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.290> very<00:05:29.410> much<00:05:29.650> because<00:05:30.160> it<00:05:31.060> just

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
didn't use it very much because it just

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.970 
didn't use it very much because it just
wasn't<00:05:31.750> as<00:05:31.840> fast<00:05:32.020> as<00:05:32.230> my<00:05:32.350> Chromebook<00:05:32.650> it

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
wasn't as fast as my Chromebook it

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.980 
wasn't as fast as my Chromebook it
wasn't<00:05:33.370> making<00:05:33.730> my<00:05:33.850> life<00:05:34.030> better<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.660> wasn't

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
wasn't making my life better it wasn't

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.390 
wasn't making my life better it wasn't
making<00:05:35.140> things<00:05:35.470> more<00:05:35.680> efficient<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.280> was

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
making things more efficient it was

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.760 
making things more efficient it was
actually<00:05:36.730> slowing<00:05:36.970> me<00:05:37.180> down<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.350> took<00:05:38.530> him

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
actually slowing me down so I took him

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.770 
actually slowing me down so I took him
back<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.920> Costco<00:05:39.430> and<00:05:39.610> then<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.270> bought<00:05:40.540> this
