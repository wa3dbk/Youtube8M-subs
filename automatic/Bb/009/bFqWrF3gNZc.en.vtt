00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
found the spot of the resurrection and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.710 
found the spot of the resurrection and
the<00:00:30.140> first<00:00:30.650> thing<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.369> Romans<00:00:32.360> did<00:00:32.509> was

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
the first thing that the Romans did was

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.560 
the first thing that the Romans did was
or<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.020> Roman<00:00:33.500> Christians<00:00:34.160> did<00:00:34.340> was<00:00:34.940> build<00:00:35.300> a

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
or the Roman Christians did was build a

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.380 
or the Roman Christians did was build a
church<00:00:35.930> on<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.290> spot<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.670> church<00:00:38.060> over

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
church on the spot and the church over

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.509 
church on the spot and the church over
the<00:00:38.420> tomb<00:00:38.720> itself<00:00:38.989> was<00:00:39.649> round<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.280> looked<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
the tomb itself was round it looked a

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.340 
the tomb itself was round it looked a
lot<00:00:40.609> like<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.910> Pantheon<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.629> Rome<00:00:41.690> which<00:00:42.199> is<00:00:42.320> a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
lot like the Pantheon in Rome which is a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.869 
lot like the Pantheon in Rome which is a
big<00:00:42.530> round<00:00:42.769> building<00:00:43.010> with<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.370> dome<00:00:43.640> on<00:00:43.850> top

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
big round building with the dome on top

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.150 
big round building with the dome on top
and<00:00:44.359> that<00:00:45.050> would<00:00:45.199> have<00:00:45.230> been<00:00:45.410> a<00:00:45.469> very<00:00:45.859> long

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
and that would have been a very long

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.119 
and that would have been a very long
standing<00:00:46.789> Roman<00:00:47.030> tradition<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.649> round

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
standing Roman tradition that round

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.549 
standing Roman tradition that round
buildings<00:00:49.670> mark<00:00:50.329> spots<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.870> veneration<00:00:51.199> and

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
buildings mark spots of veneration and

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.410 
buildings mark spots of veneration and
that's<00:00:52.010> one<00:00:52.190> of<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.339> classic<00:00:52.820> building<00:00:53.179> types

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
that's one of the classic building types

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.590 
that's one of the classic building types
all<00:00:53.780> throughout<00:00:54.140> a<00:00:54.500> traditional<00:00:55.100> building

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
all throughout a traditional building

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.169 
all throughout a traditional building
that<00:00:56.600> grows<00:00:57.530> from<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:58.010> tomb<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.030> have

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
that grows from the tomb so you have

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.790 
that grows from the tomb so you have
somebody<00:00:59.359> die<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.960> they're<00:01:00.079> buried<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:00.589> they

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
somebody die and they're buried and they

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.250 
somebody die and they're buried and they
would<00:01:00.949> pile<00:01:01.390> soil<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.660> top<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.019> make<00:01:03.230> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
would pile soil on top of the make a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.380 
would pile soil on top of the make a
burial<00:01:03.739> mound<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.250> would<00:01:04.400> naturally<00:01:04.879> form<00:01:05.180> a

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
burial mound and would naturally form a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.050 
burial mound and would naturally form a
round<00:01:05.990> shape<00:01:06.290> and<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.310> became<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.909> model

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
round shape and so that became the model

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.850 
round shape and so that became the model
for<00:01:08.240> tomb<00:01:08.750> buildings<00:01:09.290> from<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:09.680> on

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
for tomb buildings from then on

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.580 
for tomb buildings from then on
Constantine's<00:01:10.520> own<00:01:11.480> tomb<00:01:11.780> for<00:01:12.110> instance<00:01:12.410> is

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
Constantine's own tomb for instance is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.620 
Constantine's own tomb for instance is
round<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:14.090> his<00:01:14.180> niece<00:01:14.360> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
round and so is that of his niece and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.990 
round and so is that of his niece and
other<00:01:14.780> Roman<00:01:15.170> emperors<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:16.580> also<00:01:16.730> an

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
other Roman emperors and it's also an

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.450 
other Roman emperors and it's also an
interesting<00:01:17.330> geometrical<00:01:18.310> situation<00:01:19.310> that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
interesting geometrical situation that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.190 
interesting geometrical situation that
there's<00:01:19.610> only<00:01:19.670> one<00:01:19.970> common<00:01:20.420> point<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:21.020> a

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
there's only one common point in a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.250 
there's only one common point in a
circle<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.910> center<00:01:23.240> every<00:01:23.990> spot

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
circle and that is the center every spot

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.990 
circle and that is the center every spot
of<00:01:24.290> a<00:01:24.470> circle<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:25.010> an<00:01:25.190> equal<00:01:25.550> distance<00:01:25.880> from

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
of a circle is an equal distance from

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.760 
of a circle is an equal distance from
its<00:01:26.300> center<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.320> there's<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.560> natural

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
its center and so there's a natural

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.620 
its center and so there's a natural
focus<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> center<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.150> if<00:01:29.240> you're<00:01:29.360> going

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
focus on the center so if you're going

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.510 
focus on the center so if you're going
to<00:01:29.690> build<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:30.140> building<00:01:30.380> that's<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.280> top<00:01:31.490> of

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
to build a building that's on the top of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.330 
to build a building that's on the top of
a<00:01:31.910> spot<00:01:32.600> that's<00:01:32.870> important<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.100> place

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
a spot that's important like the place

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.890 
a spot that's important like the place
where<00:01:34.610> Christ's<00:01:34.940> body<00:01:35.090> was<00:01:35.450> laid<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.810> where

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
where Christ's body was laid and where

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.450 
where Christ's body was laid and where
the<00:01:35.990> resurrection<00:01:36.530> happened<00:01:36.860> naturally

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the resurrection happened naturally

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.310 
the resurrection happened naturally
you'd<00:01:37.910> put<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.120> round<00:01:38.360> building<00:01:38.750> around<00:01:39.110> it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
you'd put a round building around it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.590 
you'd put a round building around it
that<00:01:39.350> naturally<00:01:40.220> focuses<00:01:40.730> where<00:01:40.940> that<00:01:41.180> event

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that naturally focuses where that event

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.980 
that naturally focuses where that event
happened<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.000> Constantine<00:01:44.000> said<00:01:44.300> some

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
happened and Constantine said some

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.270 
happened and Constantine said some
interesting<00:01:45.110> things<00:01:45.560> or<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:45.860> least<00:01:46.040> the

interesting things or at least the

interesting things or at least the
