hell<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.360> chances<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> building

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hell of a lot so the chances of building

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
hell of a lot so the chances of building
it<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.619> fairly<00:01:20.250> even<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.180> like

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
it a fairly even you know it's not like

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
it a fairly even you know it's not like
super<00:01:21.630> expensive<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.680> very<00:01:22.979> cheap<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
super expensive it's not very cheap but

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.859 
super expensive it's not very cheap but
you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.450> chance<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you know you have a good chance of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
you know you have a good chance of
building<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.530> don't<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.920> don't<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
building this I don't I don't think is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.640 
building this I don't I don't think is
that<00:01:26.610> expensive<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.420> think<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> cost<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> packed
