00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
drawing one of our to clue stones yeah I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.880 
drawing one of our to clue stones yeah I
deserve<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.939> draw<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:07.899> so<00:01:08.899> any<00:01:09.170> black<00:01:09.530> source

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
deserve to draw that so any black source

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.499 
deserve to draw that so any black source
any<00:01:10.250> white<00:01:11.060> source<00:01:11.420> is<00:01:13.210> basically<00:01:14.210> what<00:01:14.360> we're

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
any white source is basically what we're

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.450 
any white source is basically what we're
looking<00:01:14.720> for<00:01:14.750> or<00:01:15.740> something<00:01:16.039> we<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.220> cast

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
looking for or something we can cast

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.889 
looking for or something we can cast
without<00:01:16.610> black<00:01:16.970> or<00:01:17.119> white<00:01:17.299> which<00:01:17.539> is<00:01:17.720> not

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
without black or white which is not

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.289 
without black or white which is not
ideal<00:01:18.520> good<00:01:19.520> thing<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.670> didn't<00:01:19.880> cut<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.119> whores

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
ideal good thing I didn't cut in whores

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.330 
ideal good thing I didn't cut in whores
a<00:01:20.509> key<00:01:20.990> rune<00:01:21.200> oh<00:01:23.470> yeah

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.450 

there's<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.400> white<00:01:29.550> source<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:31.280> little<00:01:32.280> late

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there's a white source a little late

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.850 
there's a white source a little late
though<00:01:32.750> but<00:01:33.750> maybe<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.230> block<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> guy

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
though but maybe we can block this guy

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.260 
though but maybe we can block this guy
when<00:01:35.070> he<00:01:35.130> does<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.280> man<00:01:35.580> up<00:01:36.350> not<00:01:37.350> ideal

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.440 

wow<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:49.009> guy<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.219> probably<00:01:49.520> okay<00:01:50.179> in<00:01:50.329> the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
wow this guy is probably okay in the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.469 
wow this guy is probably okay in the
format<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:51.229> be<00:01:51.320> perfectly<00:01:51.679> honest<00:01:52.270> because<00:01:53.270> it

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
format to be perfectly honest because it

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.120 
format to be perfectly honest because it
he<00:01:53.960> probably<00:01:54.140> sided<00:01:54.469> into<00:01:54.679> this<00:01:54.770> actually

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
he probably sided into this actually

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.990 
he probably sided into this actually
because<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.460> good<00:01:55.579> way<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.729> get<00:01:55.850> through

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
because it's a good way to get through

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.099 
because it's a good way to get through
all<00:01:56.149> my<00:01:56.360> ex<00:01:56.689> fours<00:01:58.509> that's<00:01:59.509> probably<00:01:59.810> enough

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
all my ex fours that's probably enough

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.199 
all my ex fours that's probably enough
to<00:02:00.229> just<00:02:00.409> kill<00:02:00.530> us<00:02:00.679> actually<00:02:04.090> not<00:02:05.090> sure

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
to just kill us actually not sure

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:14.720 
to just kill us actually not sure
there's<00:02:05.600> much<00:02:05.659> I<00:02:05.899> could<00:02:06.049> do<00:02:06.110> about<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.350> card

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.020 

it's<00:02:15.269> like<00:02:15.390> include<00:02:15.870> stone<00:02:16.340> warped<00:02:17.340> physique

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's like include stone warped physique

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's like include stone warped physique
killing<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.019> guy<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.340> computer<00:02:20.730> by<00:02:20.849> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
killing this guy then I computer by that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:30.710 
killing this guy then I computer by that
guy<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.299> some<00:02:21.480> point<00:02:23.330> now<00:02:24.330> let's<00:02:24.599> do<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.000 

well<00:02:31.350> he's<00:02:31.500> tapped<00:02:31.740> out<00:02:31.920> anyway<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:34.770> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
well he's tapped out anyway this is

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.510 
well he's tapped out anyway this is
quite<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:38.510> yeah<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:41.130> breaks<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
quite the yeah this this breaks the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.640 
quite the yeah this this breaks the
board<00:02:41.730> stall<00:02:41.970> quite<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> bit<00:02:45.200> quite<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> magic

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
board stall quite a bit quite the magic

00:02:46.650 --> 00:03:02.870 
board stall quite a bit quite the magic
card<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.580> situation

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.280 

so<00:03:03.880> something<00:03:04.300> huge

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.330 

probably<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> maze<00:03:13.370> runner<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:14.000> some<00:03:14.209> kind<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
probably a maze runner of some kind it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.720 
probably a maze runner of some kind it
also<00:03:16.489> be<00:03:16.640> something<00:03:17.560> insane<00:03:18.560> she's<00:03:19.519> going<00:03:19.640> to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
also be something insane she's going to

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.849 
also be something insane she's going to
draw<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:19.909> bunch<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.269> cards<00:03:20.680> yuck<00:03:23.680> that's<00:03:24.680> not

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
draw a bunch of cards yuck that's not

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:38.900 
draw a bunch of cards yuck that's not
good<00:03:24.890> that's<00:03:26.859> not<00:03:27.859> good<00:03:27.980> at<00:03:28.219> all<00:03:30.909> phantasm

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.550 

well

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.680 

I<00:03:42.620> mean<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.340> could<00:03:43.489> play<00:03:43.700> something<00:03:44.030> like<00:03:44.209> gorg

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
I mean I could play something like gorg

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.920 
I mean I could play something like gorg
on<00:03:44.810> here<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:47.270> causes<00:03:47.420> them<00:03:47.569> to<00:03:47.599> tap<00:03:47.900> a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
on here that just causes them to tap a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.290 
on here that just causes them to tap a
white<00:03:48.200> mana<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:50.510> play<00:03:50.920> phantasm<00:03:52.300> that

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
white mana I can play phantasm that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.640 
white mana I can play phantasm that
doesn't<00:03:53.599> really<00:03:54.250> do<00:03:55.250> anything<00:03:55.580> either<00:03:56.060> I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
doesn't really do anything either I

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.990 
doesn't really do anything either I
probably<00:03:57.650> just<00:03:57.860> leave<00:03:57.980> up<00:03:58.190> man<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.459> here<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
probably just leave up man I here and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.800 
probably just leave up man I here and
leave<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> deputy<00:04:00.230> plus<00:04:00.500> putrefy<00:04:01.569> not<00:04:02.569> sure<00:04:02.720> if

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
leave a deputy plus putrefy not sure if

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.830 
leave a deputy plus putrefy not sure if
I<00:04:02.870> would<00:04:02.930> picture<00:04:03.200> fly<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.470> thing<00:04:03.650> though<00:04:04.010> I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
I would picture fly this thing though I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.830 
I would picture fly this thing though I
probably<00:04:05.840> have<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.890> can<00:04:07.010> actually<00:04:07.250> block

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
probably have to so I can actually block

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.270 
probably have to so I can actually block
walking<00:04:08.840> is<00:04:08.959> not<00:04:09.140> ideal<00:04:09.319> with<00:04:09.650> lima<00:04:09.890> battle

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
walking is not ideal with lima battle

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.240 
walking is not ideal with lima battle
and<00:04:10.430> play<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.870> card<00:04:12.110> seems<00:04:12.349> actually<00:04:12.920> pretty

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
and play this card seems actually pretty

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.680 
and play this card seems actually pretty
damn<00:04:13.459> good<00:04:13.670> if<00:04:13.849> you're<00:04:14.000> on<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.180> aggressive

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
damn good if you're on the aggressive

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:25.360 
damn good if you're on the aggressive
plan<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:21.560> Gorgone<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:23.290> he<00:04:24.290> taps<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.130> take

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
plan so Gorgone and he taps it I take

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.420 
plan so Gorgone and he taps it I take
two<00:04:26.320> extra<00:04:27.320> my<00:04:27.380> computer<00:04:27.860> five-block<00:04:28.400> a

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
two extra my computer five-block a

two extra my computer five-block a
creature<00:04:28.729> you<00:04:29.060> actually<00:04:29.389> can't<00:04:30.169> tap<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:32.650> guess

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
creature you actually can't tap I guess

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.030 
creature you actually can't tap I guess
that's<00:04:33.889> okay

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.500 

well<00:04:41.670> let's<00:04:41.820> see<00:04:41.940> how<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.150> goes<00:04:44.510> I'm

well let's see how this goes I'm
starting<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.900> get<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.080> good<00:04:46.230> feeling<00:04:46.290> about

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
starting to get a good feeling about

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.860 
starting to get a good feeling about
some<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.130> these<00:04:47.220> cards<00:04:47.580> though<00:04:47.760> like<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.810> is

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
some of these cards though like this is

some of these cards though like this is
a<00:04:48.960> card<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.230> might<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.560> overlooked<00:04:50.040> but<00:04:50.430> it's

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
a card I might have overlooked but it's

a card I might have overlooked but it's
quite<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.240> bit<00:04:51.390> better<00:04:51.540> than<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.810> think<00:04:52.020> it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
quite a bit better than I think it

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.680 
quite a bit better than I think it
actually<00:04:52.230> is<00:04:52.850> alright<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:53.880> thought<00:04:54.450> it<00:04:54.570> was

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
actually is alright I thought it was

yeah<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.580> let's<00:05:54.150> run<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.510> out<00:05:54.750> leave<00:05:55.560> a

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
yeah so let's run this out leave a

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.330 
yeah so let's run this out leave a
counter<00:05:56.460> putrefy<00:05:57.270> deputy<00:05:58.040> this<00:05:59.040> games<00:05:59.250> pretty

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
counter putrefy deputy this games pretty

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.910 
counter putrefy deputy this games pretty
much<00:05:59.760> over<00:05:59.940> at<00:06:00.180> this<00:06:00.300> point<00:06:00.540> though<00:06:00.920> this

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
much over at this point though this

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.660 
much over at this point though this
format<00:06:02.280> is<00:06:02.310> very<00:06:02.910> swinging<00:06:04.010> like<00:06:05.010> every<00:06:05.460> game

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
format is very swinging like every game

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.530 
format is very swinging like every game
has<00:06:05.850> been<00:06:06.030> pretty<00:06:06.300> one-sided<00:06:07.400> at<00:06:08.400> some<00:06:09.270> point

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
has been pretty one-sided at some point

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.660 
has been pretty one-sided at some point
last<00:06:09.960> game<00:06:10.170> definitely<00:06:10.620> wasn't<00:06:11.040> until<00:06:11.550> we

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
last game definitely wasn't until we

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.610 
last game definitely wasn't until we
drew<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.000> incubation<00:06:12.750> chamber<00:06:13.260> which<00:06:13.440> is

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
drew the incubation chamber which is

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.710 
drew the incubation chamber which is
just<00:06:13.800> a<00:06:13.920> total<00:06:14.220> bomb<00:06:14.400> like<00:06:15.330> there's<00:06:15.480> no<00:06:15.600> way<00:06:15.630> I

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
just a total bomb like there's no way I

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:21.590 
just a total bomb like there's no way I
can<00:06:15.780> beat<00:06:16.050> that<00:06:16.080> card<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:20.330> will<00:06:21.330> have<00:06:21.480> to<00:06:21.510> kill

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
can beat that card I will have to kill

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.380 
can beat that card I will have to kill
this<00:06:21.840> guy<00:06:21.990> at<00:06:22.140> some<00:06:22.290> point<00:06:22.730> probably<00:06:23.730> be<00:06:24.180> next

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
this guy at some point probably be next

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.900 
this guy at some point probably be next
turn<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:27.830> want<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.890> counter<00:06:29.160> something<00:06:29.760> this

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
turn I want to counter something this

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:40.110 
turn I want to counter something this
turn<00:06:30.120> if<00:06:30.300> possible

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:50.559 

I<00:06:40.180> like<00:06:40.960> encounter<00:06:41.350> that

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.730 

and<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.289> as<00:06:51.499> five<00:06:51.770> mana<00:06:52.069> her<00:06:52.550> a<00:06:53.589> good<00:06:54.589> thing

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
and you as five mana her a good thing

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.350 
and you as five mana her a good thing
they<00:06:54.830> made<00:06:55.009> it<00:06:55.129> counter<00:06:55.490> unless<00:06:55.759> they<00:06:55.909> pay<00:06:56.059> six

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
they made it counter unless they pay six

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.100 
they made it counter unless they pay six
so<00:06:56.689> it's<00:06:56.839> actually<00:06:56.990> relevant<00:06:57.619> in<00:06:57.889> the<00:06:57.979> format

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
so it's actually relevant in the format

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:09.710 
so it's actually relevant in the format
not<00:07:00.110> like<00:07:00.229> it<00:07:00.349> matters<00:07:00.589> too<00:07:00.740> much

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200 
ideal but this is a format you don't

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.080 
ideal but this is a format you don't
really<00:07:43.290> get<00:07:43.410> to<00:07:43.530> see<00:07:43.740> very<00:07:44.430> often<00:07:44.670> that<00:07:44.910> you
