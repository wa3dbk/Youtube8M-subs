also cleaned or even replaced this

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:15.580 
also cleaned or even replaced this
chambers<00:02:09.560> okay<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:12.660> right

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:27.640 

a<00:02:21.760> main<00:02:22.760> bearings<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.500> connecting<00:02:26.500> elicit<00:02:27.500> a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
a main bearings and connecting elicit a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.990 
a main bearings and connecting elicit a
crankshaft<00:02:28.550> seal<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:30.620> seal<00:02:31.010> elusive<00:02:31.730> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
crankshaft seal from seal elusive and

crankshaft seal from seal elusive and
the<00:02:32.390> bearings<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:38.930> what<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.560> get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the bearings so this is what you get

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.870 
the bearings so this is what you get
motor<00:02:41.150> ready<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.629> be<00:02:41.750> assembled
