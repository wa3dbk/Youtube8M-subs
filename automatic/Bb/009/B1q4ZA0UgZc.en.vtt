00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 Welcome to pralines way to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.569
 de 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.890
 Today we bring round pralines 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.679
 a double form 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.010
 for this they need two different ones 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:15.370
 nougat fillings pinch a spatula 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.900
 and fix aspire a cherry we have 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.079
 the two already convinced in 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.839
 pouch prepared we have the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.859
 formula already with peter couverture 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.599
 lined and filled the half 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 shape now with both lukas words 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.980
 The half should form up to the edge 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.989
 will be filled with no later 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.989
 Air holes in the praline arise 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.430
 we knock the mold on something 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.879
 Air bubbles in the fill up 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.879
 climb 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.869
 the excess nougat we brush 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 clean with the spatula 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.760
 both forms we work quickly to a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.560
 other 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.000
 Now we reduce it with the pixies 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.000
 stick and clamp 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 After that, the mold will harden 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.930
 set aside 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.180
 after curing they can 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.180
 make balls easily out of shape 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
 to solve 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
 after that, the ball could be left to one's liking 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.640
 decorate 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.230
 In our case we ask the noodles in 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.019
 green aluminum foil 1 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.709
 You can also do it by hand 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.450
 show coalition and then roll it into cocoa 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.849
 That was a tip from Berlin noted de 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.010
