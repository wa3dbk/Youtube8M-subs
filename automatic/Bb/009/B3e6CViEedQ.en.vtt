00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
long as I've had this shop I've had this

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.910 
long as I've had this shop I've had this
century-old<00:01:53.360> map<00:01:53.929> of<00:01:54.110> our<00:01:54.200> county<00:01:54.649> on<00:01:54.740> the

wall here and it has been driving me

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.260 
wall here and it has been driving me
crazy<00:01:56.689> because<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.920> shows<00:01:58.459> about<00:01:58.670> 8<00:01:58.969> miles

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270

stone quarry now no one I spoke to new a
thing<00:02:04.429> about<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:04.909> place<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.659> was<00:02:05.719> only<00:02:05.899> a

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
thing about the place it was only a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.449 
thing about the place it was only a
little<00:02:06.170> while<00:02:06.380> ago<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.039> were<00:02:07.159> able<00:02:07.310> to

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
little while ago that we were able to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.609 
little while ago that we were able to
get<00:02:07.670> out<00:02:07.849> and<00:02:08.030> make<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.209> real<00:02:08.539> attempt<00:02:09.079> to<00:02:09.380> try

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
get out and make a real attempt to try

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.060 
get out and make a real attempt to try
and<00:02:09.799> find<00:02:10.039> it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.590 

well<00:02:20.070> we've<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.640> half-mile<00:02:21.210> more<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
well we've got about a half-mile more to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.060 
well we've got about a half-mile more to
go<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:21.930> before<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.560> there<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.800> want<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
go but before we get there I want to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
go but before we get there I want to
explain<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.580> how<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:24.120> went<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:24.540> finding

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
explain to you how I went about finding

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.930 
explain to you how I went about finding
the<00:02:25.200> place<00:02:25.380> because<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> map<00:02:26.220> is<00:02:26.460> over<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the place because that map is over a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.450 
the place because that map is over a
century<00:02:27.450> old<00:02:27.480> now<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.770> not<00:02:29.130> quite<00:02:29.340> as

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
century old now and it's not quite as

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.980 
century old now and it's not quite as
useful<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:29.940> used<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> roads<00:02:30.780> have

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
useful as it used to be the roads have

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.780 
useful as it used to be the roads have
changed<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> had<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.580> was

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
changed so what I had to do was

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
changed so what I had to do was
triangulate<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> location<00:02:33.960> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> quarry

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
triangulate the location of the quarry

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.250 
triangulate the location of the quarry
from<00:02:35.580> known<00:02:35.850> landmarks<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.630> still<00:02:36.870> exists

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
from known landmarks that still exists

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.790 
from known landmarks that still exists
cemetery<00:02:37.800> at<00:02:37.920> church<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.460> then<00:02:39.800> triangulate

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
cemetery at church and then triangulate

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.190 
cemetery at church and then triangulate
down<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.550> location<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.210> quarry<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
down to the location of the quarry as it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.870 
down to the location of the quarry as it
was<00:02:43.320> shown<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.770> old<00:02:43.950> map<00:02:44.310> measure<00:02:44.670> those

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
was shown on the old map measure those

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.810 
was shown on the old map measure those
distances<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:46.110> change<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:47.040> scale<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.640> that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
distances then change the scale of that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.390 
distances then change the scale of that
triangulation<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> modern<00:02:50.010> toppa

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
triangulation to that of a modern toppa

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.980 
triangulation to that of a modern toppa
that<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.940> county<00:02:51.240> andrey
