then I gotta start one right here right
in<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.729> middle<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.239> noodle<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.620> goes

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
in the middle of this noodle and it goes

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.270 
in the middle of this noodle and it goes
to<00:02:12.040> about<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.760> middle<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:17.160> going<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
to about the middle of this one going to
make<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.610> rendered

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.590

what it is it has six sides I think it
goes<00:02:52.190> right<00:02:52.430> here<00:02:52.490> like<00:02:53.360> one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.140 

and<00:03:01.140> swirly<00:03:02.140> thing<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.670> gotta<00:03:03.670> make<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.879> bigger

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
and swirly thing I gotta make it bigger

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:28.140 
and swirly thing I gotta make it bigger
though<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:06.209> live<00:03:07.209> in<00:03:07.299> here

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.520 

can't<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.480> right<00:03:31.480> there<00:03:32.480> we<00:03:32.659> go<00:03:32.900> hello

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
can't do this right there we go hello

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:44.760 
can't do this right there we go hello
laughs<00:03:33.829> real<00:03:34.040> thing<00:03:34.250> though

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:53.770 

and<00:03:46.180> then<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:49.670> eyes<00:03:51.790> by<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.820> way<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.450> easier

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
and then the eyes by the way it's easier

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.360 
and then the eyes by the way it's easier
to<00:03:53.930> use<00:03:54.050> mechanical<00:03:54.680> pencil<00:03:55.040> because<00:03:55.130> there's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
to use mechanical pencil because there's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.480 
to use mechanical pencil because there's
a<00:03:55.430> finer<00:03:55.640> tip<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.300> is<00:03:56.450> your<00:03:56.690> choice<00:03:57.490> and

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
a finer tip but it is your choice and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.420 
a finer tip but it is your choice and
then<00:03:59.350> you<00:04:00.350> go<00:04:00.500> like<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:02.380> for<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.500> eyes<00:04:03.770> and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
then you go like this for the eyes and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.320 
then you go like this for the eyes and
you<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.750> guess<00:04:06.170> that's<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.650> little<00:04:09.820> okay<00:04:10.820> it's

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
you I guess that's a little okay it's

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.790 
you I guess that's a little okay it's
like<00:04:11.600> this<00:04:11.990> and<00:04:12.260> it's<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> roundish<00:04:14.800> up

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
like this and it's like a roundish up

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:25.660 
like this and it's like a roundish up
here<00:04:16.160> red<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:24.140> it's<00:04:24.380> like<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> rainbow<00:04:24.980> with<00:04:25.460> no

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
here red and it's like a rainbow with no

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.800 
here red and it's like a rainbow with no
colors<00:04:26.150> really<00:04:30.280> but<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.490> line<00:04:31.810> stays

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
colors really but this line stays

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.220 
colors really but this line stays
through<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:34.420> except<00:04:35.420> for<00:04:35.450> right<00:04:35.690> here<00:04:35.750> because

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
through it except for right here because

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.690 
through it except for right here because
you<00:04:36.350> color<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.890> there<00:04:37.130> but<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> stays

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
you color that in there but it stays

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.200 
you color that in there but it stays
right<00:04:38.030> here<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:39.320> don't<00:04:39.530> hear<00:04:39.650> yourself<00:04:40.210> and

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
right here you don't hear yourself and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.360 
right here you don't hear yourself and
then<00:04:41.480> there's<00:04:41.750> another<00:04:42.080> one<00:04:42.440> like<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:43.010> far

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
then there's another one like this far

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.300 
then there's another one like this far
apart<00:04:43.550> from<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:45.610> oh<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:48.050> better<00:04:48.350> see<00:04:48.980> this<00:04:49.100> one

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
apart from it oh I better see this one

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.260 
apart from it oh I better see this one
out<00:04:49.460> reckon<00:04:49.790> a<00:04:49.820> little<00:04:50.270> on<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.480> side<00:04:50.720> too<00:04:50.960> much

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
out reckon a little on the side too much

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.970 
out reckon a little on the side too much
it's<00:04:53.270> a<00:04:53.419> bet<00:04:53.720> right<00:04:53.750> here<00:04:54.320> i<00:04:54.350> guess<00:04:54.530> i<00:04:54.770> should

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
it's a bet right here i guess i should

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.570 
it's a bet right here i guess i should
say<00:04:57.130> little<00:04:58.130> rainbow<00:04:58.550> with<00:04:58.730> no<00:04:58.880> colors<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
say little rainbow with no colors and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.400 
say little rainbow with no colors and
then<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.820> other<00:05:01.910> one's<00:05:02.240> right<00:05:02.330> there<00:05:02.450> another

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
then the other one's right there another

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:25.970 
then the other one's right there another
little<00:05:03.770> rainbow<00:05:04.250> with<00:05:04.430> nail<00:05:04.640> polish

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.930 

makes<00:05:26.640> it<00:05:26.820> go<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.750> part<00:05:28.110> right<00:05:28.170> here<00:05:28.940> goes

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
makes it go this part right here goes

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.730 
makes it go this part right here goes
all<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.180> way<00:05:30.420> up<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.600> here<00:05:35.960> what<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:37.170> little

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
all the way up to here what a little

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.560

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
then you go draw lines right here that

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.080 
then you go draw lines right here that
sounded<00:06:36.030> it<00:06:36.180> up<00:06:36.560> and<00:06:37.560> that's<00:06:38.220> where<00:06:38.910> you're
