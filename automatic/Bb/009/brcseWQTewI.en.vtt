there's intersections at 95 but alyssum
it's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> pace<00:01:02.550> test<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.539> believe<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> was<00:01:04.140> on

his auntie em season car we start
halfway<00:01:13.979> line<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.299> same<00:01:15.479> sort<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.780> time

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
halfway line about the same sort of time

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
halfway line about the same sort of time
and<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.770> literally<00:01:17.340> hold<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> spin<00:01:17.880> button

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and I just literally hold a spin button

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
and I just literally hold a spin button
and<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.380> left<00:01:19.590> analog<00:01:19.830> stick<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.400> the

and right the left analog stick in the

and right the left analog stick in the
right<00:01:20.640> direction<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.299> we'll<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.530> how

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
right direction and we'll just see how

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
right direction and we'll just see how
that<00:01:23.700> pace<00:01:23.909> compares<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that pace compares and you can see like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.070 
that pace compares and you can see like
that<00:01:25.799> they<00:01:26.460> finish<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> same<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.990> as

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that they finish at the same time so as

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.310 
that they finish at the same time so as
pace<00:01:28.320> hasn't<00:01:28.710> gone<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
pace hasn't gone up at all so I'm that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
pace hasn't gone up at all so I'm that
proves<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.700> own<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.119> battle

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
proves it like that just own it battle

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
proves it like that just own it battle
been<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
been a bit how that and work like that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880 
been a bit how that and work like that
so<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> thought<00:01:36.810> how<00:01:36.900> quite<00:01:37.140> interesting<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so I thought how quite interesting to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590 
so I thought how quite interesting to

absolutely fantastic just look at out as

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.140 
absolutely fantastic just look at out as
well<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.590> slide<00:02:09.890> tackling<00:02:10.310> as<00:02:10.520> vague<00:02:10.700> as<00:02:10.729> well

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
well the slide tackling as vague as well

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.330 
well the slide tackling as vague as well
it's<00:02:11.390> only<00:02:11.930> about<00:02:12.020> mid<00:02:12.290> eighties<00:02:12.650> about<00:02:12.890> 85

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
it's only about mid eighties about 85

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.030 
it's only about mid eighties about 85
but<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.480> still<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.780> very<00:02:15.110> decent<00:02:15.350> as<00:02:15.680> well<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but it's still a very decent as well I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.250 
but it's still a very decent as well I
found<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.330> little<00:02:17.600> bit<00:02:17.720> inconsistent

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
found it to be a little bit inconsistent

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.200 
found it to be a little bit inconsistent
and<00:02:18.650> with<00:02:18.920> his<00:02:19.190> direction<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> slide

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
obviously that amazing stand and tackle

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.310 
obviously that amazing stand and tackle
it<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.550> sections<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.450> position<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.930> exits

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
it in sections and the position in exits

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.530 
it in sections and the position in exits
it<00:02:27.470> does<00:02:27.650> seem<00:02:27.830> slow<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.430> as<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.090> see<00:02:29.120> and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
it does seem slow and as you can see and
