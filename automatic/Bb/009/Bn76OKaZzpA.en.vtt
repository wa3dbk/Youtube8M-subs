00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
do's and dont's about amplifiers well a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.920 
do's and dont's about amplifiers well a
lot<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.750> people<00:00:03.899> do<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> lot<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.680> don'ts

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
lot of people do a lot of don'ts

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.580 
lot of people do a lot of don'ts
hilarious<00:00:06.930> things<00:00:07.429> like<00:00:08.429> hooking<00:00:08.730> up

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
hilarious things like hooking up

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.959 
hilarious things like hooking up
amplifiers<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.610> talked<00:00:11.880> about

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
amplifiers with like I talked about

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.209 
amplifiers with like I talked about
earlier<00:00:12.120> wire<00:00:12.900> that's<00:00:13.259> too<00:00:13.440> small<00:00:13.620> wire<00:00:13.980> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
earlier wire that's too small wire that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.480 
earlier wire that's too small wire that
you<00:00:14.370> wouldn't<00:00:14.610> even<00:00:14.670> tie<00:00:15.680> around<00:00:16.680> your<00:00:17.010> pencil

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
you wouldn't even tie around your pencil

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.779 
you wouldn't even tie around your pencil
it's<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:17.940> small

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
it's so small

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's so small
hooking<00:00:20.789> power<00:00:21.060> wire<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:22.070> expose<00:00:23.070> near<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.160 
hooking power wire up expose near a
ground<00:00:23.730> wire<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.689> well<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
ground wire what does that do well that

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
ground wire what does that do well that
causes<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> short<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> then<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> blow<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.730> your

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
causes a short and then you blow up your

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.230 
causes a short and then you blow up your
amplifier<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.060> these<00:00:30.179> you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
amplifier this if you look at these you

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.799 
amplifier this if you look at these you
invest<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> money<00:00:31.529> into<00:00:31.859> an<00:00:32.430> amplifier

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
invest a lot of money into an amplifier

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.700 
invest a lot of money into an amplifier
why<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> treat<00:00:34.530> your

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
why would you want to treat your

why<00:00:37.590> would<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.860> want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> hook<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.399> with

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
why would you want to hook it up with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
why would you want to hook it up with
subpar<00:00:38.969> wire<00:00:39.239> why<00:00:39.450> would<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> want<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.079> have

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
subpar wire why would you want to have

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.400 
subpar wire why would you want to have
an<00:00:40.350> amplifier<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> wet<00:00:41.370> trunk<00:00:42.170> because<00:00:43.170> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
an amplifier in a wet trunk because you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.170 
an amplifier in a wet trunk because you
know<00:00:43.530> water<00:00:43.800> does<00:00:44.129> affect<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.640> wire<00:00:44.940> those

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
know water does affect that wire those

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.139 
know water does affect that wire those
are<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.450> don'ts<00:00:46.340> do's<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.610> amplifier

don't<00:01:09.869> try<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> drop<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.920> own<00:01:10.979> amplifier<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
don't try to drop your own amplifier to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730 
don't try to drop your own amplifier to
half<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.450> ohm<00:01:12.570> best<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.350> says<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
half an ohm best because it says it's

just go use your wood screw that you

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.910 
just go use your wood screw that you
found<00:02:17.900> unless<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.260> drill<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> pilot<00:02:19.560> hole

but<00:02:20.250> even<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:21.030> use<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> panhead<00:02:22.230> self

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
