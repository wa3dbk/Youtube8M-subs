was something like Bulls be la because

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
was something like Bulls be la because

day and he chose to play fifa 12 so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.429 
day and he chose to play fifa 12 so
basically<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> gist<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.570> I've<00:01:10.200> had<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
basically the gist of this is I've had a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
basically the gist of this is I've had a
lot<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> requests<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> people<00:01:11.700> wanting<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
lot of requests of people wanting me to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
lot of requests of people wanting me to
play<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.200> certain<00:01:13.619> games<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.820> figured

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
play them in certain games and I figured

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.050 
play them in certain games and I figured
the<00:01:15.420> best<00:01:15.570> way<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.640> by<00:01:17.640> holding<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the best way to do it is by holding a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
the best way to do it is by holding a
series<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:19.140> I've<00:01:19.470> had<00:01:19.500> people<00:01:19.710> saying

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
series because I've had people saying

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
series because I've had people saying
like<00:01:20.430> oh<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:21.150> i<00:01:21.240> play<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
like oh can i play you but it has to be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
like oh can i play you but it has to be
in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> video<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> ridiculous

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in the video which is kind of ridiculous

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.749 
in the video which is kind of ridiculous
and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.950> there's<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.280> people<00:01:26.400> don't<00:01:26.640> want

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and then there's just people don't want

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.630 
and then there's just people don't want
to<00:01:26.820> play<00:01:26.939> me<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:28.259> best<00:01:28.409> way<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> time

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to play me so the best way to get a time

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
don't know I just haven't been feeling

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.949 
don't know I just haven't been feeling
NHL<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.239> feel<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.690> should<00:04:00.720> have

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
NHL and I feel like that should have

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.860 
NHL and I feel like that should have
been<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.170> foul<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.620> but<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.400> all<00:04:02.579> good

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
been a foul there but it's all good

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.300 
been a foul there but it's all good
because<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.170> think<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.709> something<00:04:05.069> like

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
because I think I have something like

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.080 
because I think I have something like
that<00:04:05.930> later<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.019> or<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.769> was<00:04:07.889> before<00:04:08.069> that<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
that later on or it was before that that

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.699 
that later on or it was before that that
it<00:04:09.269> really<00:04:09.450> should<00:04:09.690> have<00:04:09.720> been<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.930> card<00:04:10.440> but

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
it really should have been a card but

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.460 
it really should have been a card but
this<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.819> gonna<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:12.090> his<00:04:12.209> last<00:04:12.389> opportunity<00:04:13.200> to

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
this is gonna be his last opportunity to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.339 
this is gonna be his last opportunity to
score<00:04:14.340> goal<00:04:14.639> like<00:04:15.000> these<00:04:15.180> last<00:04:15.480> few<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:16.109> I

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
score goal like these last few that I

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.839 
score goal like these last few that I
feel<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:16.799> should<00:04:16.979> have<00:04:17.099> been<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.220> foul<00:04:17.519> but

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
feel like should have been a foul but

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.789 
feel like should have been a foul but
you<00:04:18.510> know<00:04:18.630> when<00:04:18.810> he<00:04:18.930> slide<00:04:19.139> tackled<00:04:19.530> me<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
you know when he slide tackled me that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.469 
you know when he slide tackled me that
also<00:04:20.160> probably<00:04:20.519> should<00:04:20.700> gonna<00:04:20.880> foul<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.359> it's

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
also probably should gonna foul so it's

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.880 
also probably should gonna foul so it's
all<00:04:21.599> good<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:22.200> should<00:04:22.380> have<00:04:22.500> scored<00:04:22.680> right

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
all good you should have scored right

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.540 
all good you should have scored right
here<00:04:23.190> but

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
here but

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.499 
here but
I<00:04:24.610> guess<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.949> guess<00:04:26.949> instead<00:04:27.849> of<00:04:27.970> powering<00:04:28.360> it

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
I guess I guess instead of powering it

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.730 
I guess I guess instead of powering it
he<00:04:28.599> should<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:28.900> finessed<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.349> I<00:04:29.470> don't<00:04:29.650> know

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
he should have finessed it I don't know

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.469 
he should have finessed it I don't know
I<00:04:29.949> honestly<00:04:30.610> couldn't<00:04:30.849> tell<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.180> what<00:04:31.330> he

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
I honestly couldn't tell you what he

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.700 
I honestly couldn't tell you what he
should<00:04:31.720> have<00:04:31.750> done<00:04:31.840> there<00:04:32.169> in<00:04:32.319> that<00:04:32.409> situation

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
should have done there in that situation

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.379 
should have done there in that situation
because<00:04:33.129> i'm<00:04:33.220> still<00:04:33.460> not<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.819> great<00:04:34.090> at<00:04:34.270> this
