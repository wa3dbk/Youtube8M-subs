00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.430
 plus this feeling where we can find 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.170
 his happiness 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.580

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 outer things nostalgic moment 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.970
 to find peace the news 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 background trends to get you away from 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.270
 respect for human beings has become 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.070
 anti social without brain by force of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.720
 rub shoulders with all these social networks the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.040
 immense youth of education the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.550
 leaving between school is not the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.199
 solution 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.890
 ultimate goal is to become the richest

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 friends before the situation 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.160
 worsens 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.720
 I would say rather that will be treated 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 like a slave all that becomes 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.979
 surrealist and advocates individualism 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.880
 but do not confuse consumerist 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.880
 and capitalist 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.310
 more afraid to go out more sympathy 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.240
 there is no way out 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.800
 sympathy when you just have to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.660
 beat for his own survival 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.370
 a good way to make you understand even 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.560

 is no longer going out more than 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.790
 sympathy while just getting 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.409
 beat for his own survival

 proletarians there are more ministers 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.560
 to egoism strong capitalist swell 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.090
 generation 10 ch tight jeans with 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.069
 the mouth wide open there is more 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.359
 both for usability but also 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.159
 in addition to flow could in the 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.969
 evenings a big step forward 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.079
 technology 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.269
 whereas it would be enough to have 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.650
 electricity in Africa injuries 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.000
 of this wall are like a nightmare 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.769
 the media you put it all to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.090
 upside down closed in bedrooms 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.439
 with victim status 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.389
 today refuse to let the 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.919
 territory in Palestine there is more 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.480
 no limit in handling 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.219
 in the end you are just treated like a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.530
 sheep to find us a solution 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.180
 still mandate conciliation we know by 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.409
 the rich and the poor to mark the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.909
 differences of a mocking tune 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.819
 while wealth is in my heart 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.590
 that we go wrong is this the only solution 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.749
 unequal fight the human being goes straight 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.640
 towards self-destruction such reward 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:22.740
 three- tone destruction 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.480
 to get out more sympathy then 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.140
 that it is enough to fight for one's own 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.730
 survival 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.680
 there is more revolutionary too 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.810
 proletarians there are more ministers 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.580
 to selfishness times capitalism he 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.230
 there is no more exit door more than 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.790
 sympathy while just getting 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.680
 beat for his own survival 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.510
 there is no longer revolutionary too much for 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.990
 the ter there are more ministers too 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.990
 selfish 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.940
 finally 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.390
 yeah
