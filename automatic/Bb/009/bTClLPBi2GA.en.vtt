my<00:02:58.320> electrics<00:02:58.860> went<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.690> stuck<00:03:00.690> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
my electrics went out I stuck a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.510

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
broke off one of the prongs gotta get a

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.160 
broke off one of the prongs gotta get a
new<00:03:17.580> rectifier<00:03:18.360> because<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:18.990> them

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
new rectifier because one of them

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.520

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
problems broke off too and now the idiot

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.670 
problems broke off too and now the idiot
that<00:03:22.740> had<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.130> before<00:03:23.550> me<00:03:24.110> rewired<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.350> engine

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
that had it before me rewired the engine

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.140 
that had it before me rewired the engine
and<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.400> that's<00:03:26.520> why<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> can't<00:03:26.940> get<00:03:27.060> my

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and so that's why I can't get my

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.570 
and so that's why I can't get my
electrical<00:03:27.630> box<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.320> there<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.460> to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
electrical box up on there so I have to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.400 
electrical box up on there so I have to
get<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> brand-new<00:03:30.090> engine<00:03:30.330> rewiring<00:03:30.930> harness

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
get a brand-new engine rewiring harness

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
get a brand-new engine rewiring harness
which<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.680> about<00:03:31.920> $45<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.270> that's<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.540> lot<00:03:33.690> of

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
which is about $45 so that's a lot of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.480 
which is about $45 so that's a lot of
time-consuming<00:03:37.160> camera<00:03:40.190> sorry<00:03:41.190> about<00:03:41.370> this
