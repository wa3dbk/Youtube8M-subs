00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello here we suggested that great 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.750
 remove the field where for example here Flow 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.910
 people are interested well here's a thousand 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.130
 seven hundred and twenty five kilometers expense 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.560
 made up of half liters per 100 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.180
 kilometers it is essentially a mixed cycle 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.570
 because during this time 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.109
 four times nine exactly 4 can five times 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.800
 traveled to the cottage stage 50 tons 60 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.430
 kilometers from home essentially there about 20 minutes 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 in the city for about 20 minutes on a country road 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.030
 Noob and here is a mixed cycle 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.040
 Consumption here is quite acceptable here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.070
 Now we will still shoot to disperse to 100 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.370
 principle of the fault 50 waited well let's see 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.410
 how to spend will not give a moment 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 nothing you ready go killed you come on 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.530
 ends on asphalt 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.530
 on asphalt 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:11.380
 knife well what 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.380
 1 so kind 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.810
 three sisters 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.880
 the normans vadaiko 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.550
 20 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.740
 all 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 antenna 5 and from the east right now 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.960
 time 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.860
 to find 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.860
 losing weight 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.659
 o'moll is underway 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.659
 but up to 150 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.760
 357 we go 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 no 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.120
 confident enough 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.239
 I saved 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.239
 Nick 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860
 cranks 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.260
 like this right now I will shoot 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.819
 about 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.030
 so long promised video 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.030
 that's because the wheels of this dimension 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:29.139
 until we find any place on 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:30.260
 the navel will pick up the steering wheel and turn it over for a dream 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.689
 OK 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.689
 we all went there
