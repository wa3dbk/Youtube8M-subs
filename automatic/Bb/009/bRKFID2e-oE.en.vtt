00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.900 
symmetrical I didn't do one stitch
and<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:55.320> each<00:01:55.620> side<00:01:55.920> he's<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.400> don't<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
and on each side he's like I don't do it

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.730 
and on each side he's like I don't do it
as<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.420> drawing<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.230> differently

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
as if I was drawing I do it differently

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.540 
as if I was drawing I do it differently
so<00:01:58.980> look<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> first<00:02:00.630> stitch<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:00.870> so

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
so look we have the first stitch here so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.980 
so look we have the first stitch here so
if<00:02:02.550> I'm<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.850> off<00:02:03.030> cam<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.600> trying<00:02:03.840> I'm

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
if I'm going off cam I'm not trying I'm

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.530 
if I'm going off cam I'm not trying I'm
not<00:02:04.230> meaning<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.120> once<00:02:06.270> you've<00:02:06.450> done

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
not meaning to and then once you've done

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.840 
not meaning to and then once you've done
the<00:02:06.660> first<00:02:06.900> stitch<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.040> exact<00:02:08.340> same<00:02:08.369> thing

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
the first stitch do the exact same thing

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:18.740 
the first stitch do the exact same thing
but<00:02:09.030> mirror<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.510> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.930> other<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:17.750> like

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
but mirror it on the other side like

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.770 
but mirror it on the other side like
this<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:20.700> go<00:02:20.940> back<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> first<00:02:21.600> side

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this and then go back to the first side

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.540 
this and then go back to the first side
again<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.230> we're<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.830> basically<00:02:23.010> working

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
again and we're just basically working

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:38.149 
again and we're just basically working
our<00:02:23.850> way<00:02:23.880> into<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:25.080> middle

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.739 

and<00:02:39.159> then<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.639> last<00:02:39.879> stitch<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.359> just<00:02:40.599> a

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:40.749 
and then the last stitch is just a

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:47.810 
and then the last stitch is just a
straight<00:02:41.170> stitch<00:02:41.439> at<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.650> bottom

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.390 

like<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.590> did<00:02:50.830> my<00:02:50.980> stitches<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
like this because I did my stitches a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
like this because I did my stitches a
little<00:02:51.730> bit<00:02:51.850> crooked<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.870> added<00:02:53.110> one<00:02:53.470> more

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
little bit crooked I just added one more

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.120 
little bit crooked I just added one more
stitch<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.220> give<00:02:54.700> him<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:55.090> dimple<00:02:56.130> remember

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
stitch to give him a dimple remember

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.320 
stitch to give him a dimple remember
that<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.370> don't<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.150> same

stuff it and once you've done that then

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.380 
stuff it and once you've done that then
we<00:03:36.250> are<00:03:36.610> finished

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
we are finished

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.570 
we are finished
I<00:03:37.480> think<00:03:38.380> these<00:03:38.500> turned<00:03:38.710> out<00:03:38.860> super<00:03:39.100> cute<00:03:39.430> I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
I think these turned out super cute I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.160 
I think these turned out super cute I
think<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.970> like<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.300> mustard<00:03:40.600> one<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.930> little

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
think I like the mustard one a little

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.040 
think I like the mustard one a little
bit<00:03:41.260> better<00:03:41.410> than<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.740> ketchup<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:43.210> think

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
bit better than the ketchup and I think

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.450 
bit better than the ketchup and I think
it's<00:03:44.200> partly<00:03:44.440> because<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.710> think<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:45.040> face<00:03:45.250> is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
it's partly because I think this face is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.310 
it's partly because I think this face is
really<00:03:45.610> adorable<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.600> also<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.960> kind<00:03:47.140> of

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
really adorable but also I kind of

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.530 
really adorable but also I kind of
slightly<00:03:47.560> overstuffed<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.760> ketchup<00:03:49.120> one<00:03:49.330> I'm
