 reported to continue giving them a new video 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.130
 to the channel this time I bring you another 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.610
 graphical test using the geforce gtx 650 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.240
 this time I bring you 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.010
 against strike show share 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.349
 if your old game the problem 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.840
 portal 2 global offensive makes 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.530
 as well 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.270
 their 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.090
 the other graphic requirements also 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.490
 ok if we are going to see the options here 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 as always maximum resolution of 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.480
 native monitor 1600 x 900 advanced all 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 the maximum anti-alias can be 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.240
 up to 4 that the truth is not needed anymore 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 and if using a pirate context with the 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:53.100
 I do not have a problem because I tried it and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.720
 I did not like it but well at least it's better 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.060
 that the overall offensive and continued to 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.850
 true that 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.850
 I did not like it so we 're going to start 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 create be see if we can whatsapp 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 we only normal one game 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.159
 because only to prove for a being 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.729
 a map that asks for pretty graphics that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.729
 from hell 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.840
 Aztec this inferno Aztec 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.619
 rains and sick by the amount of 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 plan those things 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.670
 now teak 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.820
 the truth quite big and has everything 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.820
 that's very beautiful, very nice, it's very nice 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 everything is all running as you already 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.350
 I say in a dual-core core i3 processor 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.140
 4 gigas of ram corsair jensen a 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.840
 Motherboard 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.260
 to rock agreement that the model of 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.260
 maxims 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.630
 in this video that I now said of those from 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.829
 the one of the company of gea 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.670
 and terrorist sata hard drive like 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.310
 always terrorist 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.009
 we start fast 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.489
 young they go to 38 frames more or less 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.489
 recording 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.370
 I might go down a bit 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.710
 not taking into account that it is a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.070
 dual-core processor and it costs you 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.070
 render to record great resolutions and 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.620
 more play at the same time as 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.819
 it also needs processing power 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.360
 in multiplayer against another person 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.360
 best 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.870
 memory 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.500
 like all this 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.560
 it's pretty playable if you're going to record 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 you can also record are going to be a little 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.840
 No problem but it's still pretty 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.840
 well the truth 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.310
 here 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.310
 we have 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.180
 from him 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.180
 in January 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.939
 but good that is 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.210
 4 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.939
 well and as you can see it's going pretty good now 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.810
 let's try lowering the 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.050
 resolution 1280 x 720 that we come already 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.420
 we are here again 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.520
 and let's see now what work the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.250
 difference is greater 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 Now it's better to refer to more programs 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.000
 you know more fluid has been very well 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.000
 very different 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.470
 over here to see the sea ​​a little 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.470
 and that finish already 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.380
 what 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.380
 to 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.170
 to kill good kids here ends 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.760
 the video I hope you liked the 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.410
 favorite if they liked it and their offspring is 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.300
 say it seems to them like they see it was only 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.880
 a test but he liked it and we 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.330
 we see in the kids until then 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.480
 the desire 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.040
 or that they are on farms and grenade 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.000
 after 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.000
 good they
