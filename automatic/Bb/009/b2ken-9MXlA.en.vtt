00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
our best to make it look realistic but
we<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.059> using<00:00:54.420> real<00:00:54.629> hair<00:00:55.100> sometimes<00:00:56.100> it's

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
we are using real hair sometimes it's

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
we are using real hair sometimes it's
not<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.699> perfect<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.620> gonna

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
not going to be perfect so we're gonna

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.959 
not going to be perfect so we're gonna
comb<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.280> back<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> secure

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
comb this back and I'm going to secure

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.649

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
it towards the back of her head with an
elastic<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.740> similar<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.490> hair

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
elastic that's similar to your hair
color<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.590> want<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.280> sure<00:01:11.700> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
color so we want to just make sure that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.130 
color so we want to just make sure that
that's<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.210> close<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> her<00:01:12.689> hair<00:01:12.840> color<00:01:13.020> as

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's as close to her hair color as

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.560 
that's as close to her hair color as
possible<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> doesn't<00:01:15.299> show<00:01:15.360> too

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
possible so that it doesn't show too

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.590 
possible so that it doesn't show too
much<00:01:19.070> okay

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.480 

so<00:01:23.140> once<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.440> have<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:23.740> security<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.400> in
