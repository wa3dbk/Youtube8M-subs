00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello to today's video I want you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 talk about lipstick lipstick 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 from the faberlic brand i have all the colors 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.110
 except the only 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 2 hue these colors I really wanted 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.300
 I tested to watch 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 picture in instagramm and after that was 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.270
 quite such a big rush 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.369
 comments about me telling and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.369
 showed them how they look on the lips 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 your opinion whether to order them personally 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.140
 on my own I know for example I am always very 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.090
 hard to judge and how I doubt thrasher 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 kind of directory because they often donâ€™t 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.829
 coincide the world really comes to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.870
 we also all these colors they all 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 look equally special on some 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 specific skin color 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 Ivchenko of those lipsticks that you see 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.039
 I would advise you on me today 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.289
 just in shade 4730 and try on it 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 wrote to you in instagram took off the photo 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.690
 showed and it just can not be bombed 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.219
 so pink without the bellies and in the summer he 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.489
 cool berry looks on tanned 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.250
 skin that for example also in cold 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.519
 in the hut lipstick they do not feel very 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.740
 comfortable they are rather oily 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.930
 this texture is quite pigmented 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 pigment is not absorbed in the lips except 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 the only shade is the darkest 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 here is such a 47 33 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.580
 it's just such a sweet cherry managed to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.350
 lipstick pencils 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.909
 pretty good hours two or two with 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.150
 half they will surely hold if 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 you don't eat anything yet 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.330
 if for example I have a lot when 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.610
 talk longtime from some 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 lipsticks or pretty soft ones 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 textures they can eat with a group 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.340
 just stay lighter 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 some kind of shade on lips to a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.470
 it is the saturation of the cabin she leaves 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.810
 eaten again I repeat that no 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.540
 these are okay, they are very 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.340
 bright they are not lubricated drawing on 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.530
 naked girls and ain't letting that like 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.899
 the butter just melts and a little bit like him and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 property how to blur something here 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.689
 very very straight when so soft 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.719
 creamy softened butter good for 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.939
 my opinion is probably a shade 47 31 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.860
 who will apply strips he will emphasize 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.600
 peeling in principle which there is no 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.030
 looks a little sloppy 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 different and this color cut out my lips then 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.360
 eat i look like i am not a pear or 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.459
 I have this impression 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.090
 deliberately note - these lipsticks 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.980
 which does not seem to be a little annoying 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.920
 they are very weak caps they generally 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.420
 almost do not hold and if they always 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.580
 in even if you go somewhere if you take 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.750
 they are in a cosmetic bag can you fly and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 coat other products
