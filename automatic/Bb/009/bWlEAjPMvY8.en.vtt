00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.629 

the<00:00:00.599> basic<00:00:00.960> idea<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.469> insulate<00:00:02.159> them<00:00:02.340> some

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
the basic idea is to insulate them some

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.150 
the basic idea is to insulate them some
and<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.480> keep<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.810> wind<00:00:04.049> off<00:00:05.390> so<00:00:07.040> here's<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
and to keep the wind off so here's a

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.240 
and to keep the wind off so here's a
little<00:00:08.580> fig<00:00:08.970> plant<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.200> lot<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.860> times<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
little fig plant and a lot of times the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
little fig plant and a lot of times the
little<00:00:11.790> ones<00:00:11.940> need<00:00:12.300> as<00:00:12.450> much<00:00:12.630> protection<00:00:12.870> is

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
little ones need as much protection is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.390 
little ones need as much protection is
the<00:00:13.799> big<00:00:14.700> ones<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.179> new<00:00:15.719> growth<00:00:16.400> GBC

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the big ones and this new growth GBC

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.060 
the big ones and this new growth GBC
still<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:17.940> kind<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> green<00:00:18.660> color<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.410> it

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
still has kind of a green color to it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.700 
still has kind of a green color to it
that's<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> most<00:00:21.660> sensitive<00:00:22.320> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
that's going to be the most sensitive to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
that's going to be the most sensitive to
freezing<00:00:23.240> two<00:00:24.240> ways<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.609> going

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
freezing two ways to do this I'm going

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
freezing two ways to do this I'm going
to<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.150> quick<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.840> dirty<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to do the quick down and dirty which is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.640 
to do the quick down and dirty which is
basically<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> take<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.000> bag<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> leaves<00:00:30.650> turn

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
basically you take a bag of leaves turn

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.819 
basically you take a bag of leaves turn
them<00:00:31.800> upside<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.530> too

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
them upside down so they don't get too

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
them upside down so they don't get too
wet<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> winter

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
wet over the winter

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.650 
wet over the winter
make<00:00:37.230> another<00:00:37.530> bag<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> leaves<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> bad<00:00:41.790> thing

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
make another bag of leaves the bad thing

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
make another bag of leaves the bad thing
about<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.079> particular<00:00:43.800> technique<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
about this particular technique is it

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.170 
about this particular technique is it
looks<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.329> you've<00:00:45.629> got<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> bunch<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> bags

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
looks like you've got a bunch of bags

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.470 
looks like you've got a bunch of bags
sitting<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.840> front<00:00:49.020> yard<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.239> why

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sitting on your front yard so that's why

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.520 
sitting on your front yard so that's why
the<00:00:51.539> black<00:00:51.899> bags<00:00:52.260> might<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.760> more

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
the black bags might be a little more

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.479 
the black bags might be a little more
durable<00:00:56.090> take<00:00:57.090> some<00:00:57.270> strapping<00:01:00.199> simple<00:01:01.199> loop

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
durable take some strapping simple loop

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.730 
durable take some strapping simple loop
set<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:04.640> little<00:01:05.640> twist<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.429 

probably<00:01:10.740> run<00:01:11.640> another<00:01:12.140> something<00:01:13.140> over<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
probably run another something over the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
probably run another something over the
top<00:01:13.729> quick<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.880> dirty<00:01:15.030> cheap<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.049> TT<00:01:17.060> due

to<00:01:18.299> duty<00:01:18.630> team<00:01:20.210> here's<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> other<00:01:21.509> technique

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to duty team here's the other technique

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
to duty team here's the other technique
it<00:01:22.409> works<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.100> here's<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> plant

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it works for this one here's this plant

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.929 
it works for this one here's this plant
it's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.950> not<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.220> big<00:01:26.369> plan<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it's a not a very big plan now is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
it's a not a very big plan now is
probably<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.360> gallon<00:01:27.810> plan<00:01:28.080> last<00:01:28.350> year<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
probably a gallon plan last year go a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
probably a gallon plan last year go a
little<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.460> year<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.270> basically

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
little bit this year you basically

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.249 
little bit this year you basically
Center<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.470> wire<00:01:31.920> cage<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.520> case<00:01:32.729> it's

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
Center a wire cage in this case it's

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.340 
Center a wire cage in this case it's
it's<00:01:34.259> welded<00:01:34.680> wire<00:01:35.540> fence<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:39.049> pour<00:01:40.049> leaves

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it's welded wire fence and pour leaves

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's welded wire fence and pour leaves
and<00:01:40.710> over<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.100> plant

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.960 

it's<00:01:48.820> kind<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.060> tucked<00:01:49.300> around<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.490> plant<00:01:51.820> is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
it's kind of tucked around this plant is

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's kind of tucked around this plant is
nicely<00:01:52.240> tucked<00:01:52.600> in<00:01:52.840> it's<00:01:53.020> gonna<00:01:53.140> take<00:01:53.350> another

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
nicely tucked in it's gonna take another

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.600 
nicely tucked in it's gonna take another
bag<00:01:53.860> here<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.880> go<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:59.050> there<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.860> is<00:01:59.950> tucked<00:02:00.340> in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
bag here we go so there it is tucked in

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.170 
bag here we go so there it is tucked in
now<00:02:01.800> what<00:02:02.800> will<00:02:02.950> happen<00:02:03.490> if<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.760> leave<00:02:03.970> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
now what will happen if you leave the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.010 
now what will happen if you leave the
top<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.690> this<00:02:04.840> open<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:07.060> rains<00:02:07.570> and

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
top of this open is that the rains and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.870 
top of this open is that the rains and
snows<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.590> stuff<00:02:08.800> will<00:02:08.950> eventually<00:02:09.490> settle

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
snows the stuff will eventually settle

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.870 
snows the stuff will eventually settle
these<00:02:10.149> leaves<00:02:10.510> down<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.560> might<00:02:11.770> have<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.160> top

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
these leaves down you might have to top

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.070 
these leaves down you might have to top
it<00:02:13.090> off<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:14.410> alternative<00:02:15.070> would<00:02:15.430> be<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:16.080> maybe

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
it off the alternative would be to maybe

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.040 
it off the alternative would be to maybe
stretch<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.800> piece<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.880> plastic<00:02:19.510> or<00:02:19.720> something

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
stretch a piece of plastic or something

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.290 
stretch a piece of plastic or something
like<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.610> secure<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.150> to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
like that and just kind of secure it to

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
like that and just kind of secure it to
the<00:02:22.420> top<00:02:22.660> maybe<00:02:23.200> even<00:02:23.500> poke<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.709> couple<00:02:24.100> of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
the top maybe even poke a couple of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.920 
the top maybe even poke a couple of
holes<00:02:24.400> in<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> water<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.570> run<00:02:25.720> down

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
holes in and so the water can run down

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.510 
holes in and so the water can run down
through<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.500> but<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:26.890> would<00:02:27.010> keep<00:02:27.280> these

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
through it but it would keep these

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
through it but it would keep these
leaves<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.970> little<00:02:28.180> bit<00:02:28.300> drier<00:02:29.730> yeah<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:31.270> easy

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
leaves a little bit drier yeah it's easy

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.280 
leaves a little bit drier yeah it's easy
it<00:02:32.050> works<00:02:32.260> when<00:02:32.470> your<00:02:32.590> plants<00:02:32.890> are<00:02:33.010> small
