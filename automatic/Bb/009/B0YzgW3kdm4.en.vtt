00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 I choose the table at the bottom of the door or 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.710
 it was in a place far from the place 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.090
 easy to come well if you feel like 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.960
 good side he is the one who sits down 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.380
 side so that he goes out to give hugs now 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.090
 I think I like a better world 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.220
 I want a world where we embrace the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 Let's touch, let's look at each other tenderly and not 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 that we look with hatred with suspicion of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 side where we do not touch where 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.219
 when I sit down I go to a place and there 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.669
 three free places and I sit in the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.669
 last room 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 It is typical of the beach if it is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.120
 pizza off the cost of the castillito 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.160
 n it would not bother me to be like that with the itt 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.160
 they take out all the sand annoying permit 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.180
 I want that we like to be alone of course 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.310
 well also explains how it starts with 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.600
 people like how is it going there grabs 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.220
 the people and embraces her beyond me 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.760
 I explain what the poster listens to as 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.280
 they embraced this man and they accept him 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.740
 good are different different ways 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.210
 there are people look at that man for example 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
 it was a demonstration of the left 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.510
 I was re angry and weiss and I give him like 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.980
 a first hug and the gentleman was still half 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.300
 angry then we give him a hug 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.300
 group and ends 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.080
 and he spends his time 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.840
 I come because I 'm a teacher and I'm 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.000
 in the ela el marcelo maestro and came the 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.000
 assholes now to hug me 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.650
 the first one followed a little angry that what 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.870
 they forced is saying that he went on 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.870
 angry and then we went among all 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.829
 at first he resists but it 's good 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.139
 with me 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.049
 the strength that gave me equal 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.849
 this is the kind of heavy because it explains 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.239
 in a moment if you resist the 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.980
 hug as it happens it grabs you from booster 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.609
 resist you grab you later it loosens you and 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.040
 you win again there are no other reasons 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.370
 where another person without reason starts to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.220
 cry 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 it did not happen to me but I do feel for example its 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.620
 I embrace the hug is a hug like the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.620
 chest contact 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.670
 He explained at a time like we are hug 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.390
 no but that's how it's like with 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.370
 heart 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.250
 it's like hugging cold icons and hugging 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.430
 people sometimes do this arrive 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:35.159
 chest to the chest they separate and already 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.110
 they release more a second nothing more like 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.299
 to give a chance to more and 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:44.900
 often happens all against the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.900
 chest they let go and they come back and they stay 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.840
 explained are released are released by the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.890
 Blog 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.340
 and all heart with heart 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.500
 it's a lot but you're good he's the typical 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.420
 guy who returned according to his words he 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.060
 He returned to take the hugs to his house 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.890
 that guy who goes to a place and takes you 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.890
 unlimited hugs 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:32.419
 with the little one that was growing was 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.290
 how they all started to take a distance 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.290
 from the embrace of that and its end 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.660
 there are real goods in the pasta that you 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.120

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.090
 in my eyes 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.350
 family the bad real hygiene someone we 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.350

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.750
 he returned with the hugs to the family 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.970
 who is heavy with an association of 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.710
 this topic of people that the groups that 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.710
 they come out they are annoying 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.940
 that I do not want to hug me for looking 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.659
