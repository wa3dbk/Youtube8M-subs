00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.750 
but I didn't order this I should have
now<00:03:05.080> I'm<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.830> seeing<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.310> hair<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
now I'm really seeing this hair in the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.940 
now I'm really seeing this hair in the
light

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.080 

and<00:03:15.190> looks<00:03:15.910> red<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:18.010> has<00:03:18.220> little<00:03:18.670> red

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
and looks red like it has little red

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.580 
and looks red like it has little red
streaks<00:03:19.780> through<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:21.360> which<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.870> guess<00:03:23.410> that

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
