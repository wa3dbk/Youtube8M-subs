 face lille yet the gones opens the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.950
 mark from the third minute of play thanks to 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.560
 the sixth realization of corentin 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.090
 high tollis but in the second period the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.329
 Lyon will completely lose the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.779
 North 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:27.980
 the beautiful combination of guèye aironi 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.110
 lopes and the Senegalese equalizes in the beginning 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.039
 second period four minutes more 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.929
 quite easily to deceive his namesake 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.089

 on paris saint-germain the lyonnais 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 will still have two trips to 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.339
 negotiate at montpellier then at marseille 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.769
 the psg for the third time from the 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.339
 season misses the opportunity to delight the 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.679
 first place in a match with the 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.530
 two French representatives in league 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.479
 champions no goal yet part 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.740
 de cavani and then pastore actions 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.649
 nothing makes it the best defense of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.049
 championship did not yield the asm is at 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.820
 foot of the podium at six points from the 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.820
 third place with a late match 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.570
 without a win in three games 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.340
 Marseille received the most 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.259
 prolific in 2015 the weed stage of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.030

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.049
 stride of 15th goal of andré-pierre gignac 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:59.880
 it is nicolas seube who reduces the mark 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.909
 to 2 goals to 1 and then when as face 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.560
 psg goes back a deficit of two goals 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.170

 of maintaining on two occasions the 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.480
 maintenance becomes more and more 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.700
 complicated for lensois who do not 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.110
 do not arrive and who are sinking in the face of 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.400
 Rennes who had not won since 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.170

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:28.580
 via bouna sarr but 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.260
 the evian thonon gaillard is used to 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.610
 these matches against his competitors after 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.130

 ground just like reims that is no longer 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.070
 very serene it becomes complicated for 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.380
 lens and metz which accuses seven points of 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.210
