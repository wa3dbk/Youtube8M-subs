welcome to another screencast from DIY
PC<00:00:02.220> repairs<00:00:02.550> and<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:02.850> time<00:00:03.000> I'm<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.149> to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
PC repairs and this time I'm going to

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.400 
PC repairs and this time I'm going to
take<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> look<00:00:03.600> at<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:03.810> can<00:00:03.990> change<00:00:04.200> the

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
take a look at how we can change the

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.340 
take a look at how we can change the
simple<00:00:04.970> four-digit<00:00:05.970> pin<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.870> more<00:00:07.080> secure

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
simple four-digit pin to a more secure

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.390 
simple four-digit pin to a more secure
passcode<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.910> iPad<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.040> see<00:00:11.219> yeah

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
passcode on the iPad so you see yeah

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.829 
passcode on the iPad so you see yeah
we've<00:00:12.030> got<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> standard<00:00:13.400> pin<00:00:14.400> login<00:00:14.839> I've

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
we've got the standard pin login I've

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.859 
we've got the standard pin login I've
got<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.260> set<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:17.090> one<00:00:18.090> more<00:00:18.210> month<00:00:18.510> don't

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
got this one set to one more month don't

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.700 
got this one set to one more month don't
use<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.529> very<00:00:19.920> insecure<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:21.529> that's<00:00:22.529> what

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
use that very insecure and that's what

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.779 
use that very insecure and that's what
we<00:00:22.800> want<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.250> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> change<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
we want to do is we want to change that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.160 
we want to do is we want to change that
to<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> passphrase<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> numbers<00:00:25.050> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
to a passphrase and numbers and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.120 
to a passphrase and numbers and
numerical<00:00:26.000> alphabetical<00:00:27.000> passphrase<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
numerical alphabetical passphrase and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.950 
numerical alphabetical passphrase and
it's<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.369> simple<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.269> all<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it's very simple to do so all we do is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.760 
it's very simple to do so all we do is
go<00:00:31.109> into<00:00:31.230> settings<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:33.380> then<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.500> got<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
go into settings and then we got to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.709 
go into settings and then we got to
passcode<00:00:35.219> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.360> already<00:00:36.570> too

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
passcode which is actually already too

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.299 
passcode which is actually already too
long<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.079> we've<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.230> seen<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.160> hit

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
long as we've just seen that so they hit

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.520 
long as we've just seen that so they hit
that<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.610> glossaries<00:00:38.940> passcode<00:00:39.390> again

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.590 

not<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> most<00:00:43.800> secure<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.640> you'll<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
not the most secure and you'll see that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.630 
not the most secure and you'll see that
simple<00:00:45.930> pass<00:00:46.140> codes<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.370> turn<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
simple pass codes is on if we turn that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
simple pass codes is on if we turn that
to<00:00:47.969> off<00:00:48.149> again<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.200> been<00:00:49.289> asked<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.620> our

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to off again it's been asked for our

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.779 
to off again it's been asked for our
card<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:52.190> now<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.489> give<00:00:53.610> us<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
card and now it's going to give us the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.959 
card and now it's going to give us the
option<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.210> put<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.870> passphrase<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:56.760> our

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
option to put in a passphrase of our

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
option to put in a passphrase of our
choice<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:58.020> whatever<00:00:58.350> length<00:00:58.590> would<00:00:58.800> like

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
choice and of whatever length would like

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.750 
choice and of whatever length would like
to<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> make<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.570> simple

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
to use I'm going to make this simple

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.620 
to use I'm going to make this simple
just<00:01:02.840> abc123<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.830> they'll<00:01:05.150> go<00:01:06.150> next<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
just abc123 and they'll go next in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450 
just abc123 and they'll go next in
Alaska<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:06.990> again<00:01:07.380> again<00:01:07.979> met<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
Alaska so again again met this is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
Alaska so again again met this is
complicated<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.900> can<00:01:10.700> done<00:01:12.170> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
complicated as you as you can done and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.010 
complicated as you as you can done and
there<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> we've<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:14.640> our<00:01:14.939> master<00:01:15.869> key

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there we go we've now got our master key

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.649 
there we go we've now got our master key
or<00:01:16.110> passphrase<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:17.030> if<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.270> lock<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
or passphrase and if we now lock the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.580 
or passphrase and if we now lock the
iPad<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.060> reawaken<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> you'll<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
iPad and then reawaken it you'll see a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
iPad and then reawaken it you'll see a
different<00:01:22.920> login<00:01:23.490> screen<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:23.939> slide<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
different login screen when we slide to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
different login screen when we slide to
unlock<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> full<00:01:25.890> QWERTY

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
unlock you now get the full QWERTY

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.649 
unlock you now get the full QWERTY
keyboard<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> we

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
keyboard up so that we can so that we

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.710 
keyboard up so that we can so that we
can<00:01:31.520> difficult<00:01:32.520> something<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> top<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
can difficult something over the top of

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.660 
can difficult something over the top of
the<00:01:33.780> camera<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.619> hit<00:01:34.860> return<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.610> we

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the camera and hit return and there we

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
the camera and hit return and there we
go<00:01:35.790> off<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.180> as<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.420> off<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> cue<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
go off there as I'm off it's a cue a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.380 
go off there as I'm off it's a cue a
passcode<00:01:38.159> okay<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> change

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
passcode okay so if we want to change

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.200 
passcode okay so if we want to change
that<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:40.159> again<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.729> pass<00:01:41.909> card

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.420 
often go back to the more traditional
far<00:02:09.790> pin<00:02:10.030> unlock<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.770> that's<00:02:11.950> how<00:02:12.070> we<00:02:12.160> make<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
far pin unlock so that's how we make the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.480 
far pin unlock so that's how we make the
iPad<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:12.730> little<00:02:13.000> bit<00:02:13.090> more<00:02:13.210> secure<00:02:13.540> by<00:02:13.960> using

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490

both the numerical and an alphabetical

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.130 
both the numerical and an alphabetical
characters<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.310> our<00:02:18.400> passcode<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.060> I'd<00:02:19.990> like

characters in our passcode and I'd like

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.680
