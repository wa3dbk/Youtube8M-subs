00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.470
 we are here with gabriel ba and fabio moon 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.289
 How much passion do you have in the comics? 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.439
 I think it was my intention 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.409
 As every child has contact with comics, we had many 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.959
 comics at home my mother always the comic book 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.329
 and we sold them too, so it was that summer thing like 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:24.579
 is the water of the interior of 100 characters and copy and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.399
 I think the very beginning was was a bit beyond 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 the body from which the idea of ​​making a story ends 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.380
 with this idea of ​​making a season magazine 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.360
 the doctor came 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.660
 after you design things we do not even need to talk about 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.429
 the visual potential of a magazine having an hour was very large 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.040
 put dark scenes where you do not know what's in the dark and it gives 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.710
 fear 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.710
 paulo play with what people 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.290
 is always gave me and how to explore this visually there is some difference of 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.160
 market in brazil's overseas market 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 each market has a difference 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.530
 but you can tell a story that can be read anywhere you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.440
 believe that there is a difference in disclosure as it is disclosed and that 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 that there was an ease or difficulty of the team would be 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.640
 The market fall is that it is a bit smaller then up 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.610
 but the difficulties they are practically the same expect from you 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.760
 find your work find a space of your work 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.820
 and find the readers know that this contact with the readers does not 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.210
 talk more to show readers that their type of comics exists because 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.390
 Sometimes you make a kind of a story that people do not think you can 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.520
 make comics 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.850
 so they think it does not exist for rainfall between management 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.550
 to show people that their type of work 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.990
 has here but it has also there only in different scales by the market one 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.750
 little more than advice you would give one of the people the artists are 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.920
 entering now 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.730
 in category 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.010
 among some municipalities and the best thing to do is to do 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.660
 and it will be bad 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.230
 and they will only find out if showing one of the people so they can 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.080
 show friends at school work college for family 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.209
 every day these people all do not understand what did not work 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.799
 three powers and learn from it 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 and to innovate to do it again and do it again 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.609
 It's them that you like a lot and keep doing. 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.429
 it will take much longer 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.439
 then at the end 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.519
 If you want to make comics, you have to show people. 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.559
 the people they stay 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:41.219
 the acri year of the fantastic stories in the head and a dreaming customers being 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.999
 discoveries still the possibilities will have 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.189
 but it will only happen if you arrive and show a certain 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.829
 We managed to bring comics to people because then we will see if they work 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.129
 because the divine the senate when the superleague happens there worked in the 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.609
 folds served 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.000
 so people have to try to show the work well even if it is 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.209
 doing fanzine and even if it's ahead of the internet guides 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:10.589
 ah why is the case of pvc returned from the readers of all the artists 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:15.359
 Kyoto you will grow and will find out how and what is your path 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.069
 the market difference in brazil the market closed
