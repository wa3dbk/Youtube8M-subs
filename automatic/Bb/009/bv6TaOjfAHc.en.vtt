what<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> place<00:00:46.200> jinx<00:00:46.559> down

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
what you do first is you place jinx down

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
what you do first is you place jinx down
make<00:00:47.219> sure<00:00:47.250> peristyle<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.059> selected<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> then

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
make sure peristyle is selected and then

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
make sure peristyle is selected and then
on<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> side<00:00:50.370> I'll<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.879> golem<00:00:51.449> using

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350

on this side I'll put golem using
bulldoze<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.910> speed<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> up

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
bulldoze and then I just speed it up

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.670 
bulldoze and then I just speed it up
because<00:00:54.600> otherwise<00:00:54.899> takes<00:00:55.289> forever

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
because otherwise takes forever

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
because otherwise takes forever
jinx<00:00:56.219> will<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.399> perish<00:00:56.670> song<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> thus

jinx will use perish song and thus

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.510 
jinx will use perish song and thus
Malick's<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.629> faint<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:59.280> on<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Malick's will faint and then on this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
Malick's will faint and then on this
side<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.420> golem<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.920> just

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that will come by see if fall swipe

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
that will come by see if fall swipe
doesn't<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.920> does<00:01:08.100> barely<00:01:08.549> anything

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
doesn't do not it does barely anything

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.000 
doesn't do not it does barely anything
against<00:01:09.180> my<00:01:09.390> golem<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.840> haunters<00:01:10.560> confuse

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
against my golem and haunters confuse

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
against my golem and haunters confuse
rate<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.909> does<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.210> damage<00:01:12.570> if<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> hits

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
rate and it does for damage if it hits

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.030 
rate and it does for damage if it hits
itself<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.720> yeah<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.990> let<00:01:16.530> go<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> go

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
itself so yeah you just let go and go

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359 
itself so yeah you just let go and go
let<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.549> destroy<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.890> level<00:01:20.159> without

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
let it destroy if you get level without

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
let it destroy if you get level without
it<00:01:20.580> coming<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:20.880> only<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> 0.1%<00:01:22.110> chance<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it coming so only as a 0.1% chance of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.300 
it coming so only as a 0.1% chance of
showing<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.000> 0.01<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.259> 5%<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.040> being

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
showing up in a 0.01 to 5% of being

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.050 
showing up in a 0.01 to 5% of being
shiny<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.950> lowest<00:01:29.159> percentage<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
shiny so it's the lowest percentage of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
shiny so it's the lowest percentage of
quick<00:01:31.049> availability<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> whole<00:01:32.460> entire

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
quick availability in the whole entire

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.179 
quick availability in the whole entire
game<00:01:33.000> along<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.479> Lapras<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.070> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
game along with Lapras so you just have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.980 
game along with Lapras so you just have
to<00:01:35.310> be<00:01:35.430> patient<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> doesn't<00:01:36.900> work

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to be patient and if that doesn't work

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.130 
to be patient and if that doesn't work
just<00:01:37.049> redo<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.720> keep<00:01:39.720> doing<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.079> over

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
just redo it and keep doing it over

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010 
just redo it and keep doing it over
again<00:01:40.350> until<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.009> axe<00:01:41.220> comes<00:01:41.520> I'll<00:01:42.509> show
