to your talent it's going to be much
better<00:00:46.350> than<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.739> camera's<00:00:47.129> microphone

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
better than your camera's microphone

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
better than your camera's microphone
because<00:00:47.820> unless<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.899> working<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because unless you're working with a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
because unless you're working with a
very<00:00:49.980> wide<00:00:50.250> angle<00:00:50.399> lens<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.300> top<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
very wide angle lens right up on top of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.650 
very wide angle lens right up on top of
your<00:00:51.719> talent<00:00:52.430> that<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.760> camera<00:00:54.210> microphone

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
your talent that in camera microphone

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
your talent that in camera microphone
just<00:00:54.899> isn't<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.649> well<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:55.980> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just isn't going to do as well as this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.630 
just isn't going to do as well as this
something<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:59.039> in

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
something like this can do I also in

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.250 
something like this can do I also in
this<00:00:59.940> particular<00:01:00.090> case<00:01:00.480> I'm<00:01:00.660> recording<00:01:01.109> in

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this particular case I'm recording in

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
this particular case I'm recording in
through<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> zoom<00:01:01.890> h1<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.180> microphone<00:01:03.629> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
through the zoom h1 so the microphone is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
through the zoom h1 so the microphone is
plugged<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> zoom<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.299> in<00:01:06.299> those<00:01:06.420> cases

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
plugged into the zoom and in those cases

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
plugged into the zoom and in those cases
you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.020> actually<00:01:07.170> almost<00:01:07.619> use<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
you can actually almost use it as a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.990 
you can actually almost use it as a
wireless<00:01:08.729> lavalier<00:01:09.060> microphone<00:01:09.780> system<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
wireless lavalier microphone system so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.280 
wireless lavalier microphone system so
obviously<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.420> sync<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.900> when

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
obviously you have to sync it when

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
obviously you have to sync it when
you're<00:01:13.470> producing<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.880> video<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you're producing your your video at the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230 
you're producing your your video at the
end<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.990> post-production<00:01:16.880> but<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.060> pretty

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
end in post-production but that's pretty

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
end in post-production but that's pretty
easy<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> big<00:01:19.229> deal<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.460> forth

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
easy to do not a big deal and then forth

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
easy to do not a big deal and then forth
it's<00:01:21.689> also<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.590> long<00:01:22.830> enough<00:01:23.009> cables<00:01:23.400> between

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's also has long enough cables between

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's also has long enough cables between
15<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.119> 20<00:01:24.479> feet<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> could<00:01:24.990> plug<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
15 and 20 feet you could plug it

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
15 and 20 feet you could plug it
directly<00:01:25.500> into<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:25.920> camera<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.549> camera

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
directly into your camera if your camera

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060 
directly into your camera if your camera
has<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.150> input<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.170> that's<00:01:28.350> another<00:01:28.560> option

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
has an input so that's another option

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
has an input so that's another option
for<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.549> lots<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.030> lots<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:31.130> definite

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
can hear here is not bad it's not

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.340 
can hear here is not bad it's not
probably<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.490> find<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.350> top-tier

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
probably what you would find on top-tier

probably what you would find on top-tier
productions<00:01:41.570> professional<00:01:42.570> productions<00:01:43.079> but

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
productions professional productions but

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.399 
productions professional productions but

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it is really pretty good and so that's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
it is really pretty good and so that's
definitely<00:01:47.060> makes<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> worthwhile

investment very inexpensive to get much

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.170 
investment very inexpensive to get much
better<00:01:51.360> sound<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.500> video<00:01:53.180> one

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
better sound for your for your video one

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.980 
better sound for your for your video one
major<00:01:54.390> gotcha

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
major gotcha

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
major gotcha
this<00:01:55.430> microphone<00:01:56.430> uses<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> little<00:01:57.509> battery

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this microphone uses a little battery

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.870 
this microphone uses a little battery
pack<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> battery<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> an<00:02:01.229> LR<00:02:01.740> 44<00:02:01.880> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
pack and this battery is an LR 44 I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.219 
pack and this battery is an LR 44 I
believe<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> watch<00:02:03.930> battery

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
believe it is it's like a watch battery

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
believe it is it's like a watch battery
it's<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> relatively<00:02:04.979> small<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.180> comes

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's a relatively small one it comes

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
it's a relatively small one it comes
with<00:02:06.630> one<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> did<00:02:07.860> my

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
with one and that's what I did my

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.729 
with one and that's what I did my
original<00:02:08.399> review<00:02:08.550> one<00:02:08.879> our<00:02:09.119> review<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.140> was

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
original review one our review with was

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
original review one our review with was
the<00:02:10.920> original<00:02:11.280> battery<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.390> found<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the original battery and I found that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.370 
the original battery and I found that
there's<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.989> bit

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
there's a bit

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890 
there's a bit
distortion<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:15.630> annoying

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
distortion and I was kind of an annoying

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
distortion and I was kind of an annoying
sound<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> honest<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.310> finally<00:02:17.700> occurred

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
sound to be honest it finally occurred

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.250 
sound to be honest it finally occurred
to<00:02:18.030> me<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.270> actually<00:02:18.420> replace<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.990> battery

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
to me to actually replace the battery

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.540 
to me to actually replace the battery
and<00:02:19.320> see<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.710> made<00:02:19.860> any<00:02:19.980> difference<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and see if that made any difference and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.340 
and see if that made any difference and
in<00:02:20.640> fact<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.090> has<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.510> reduced<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.990> lot<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.170> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
in fact it has it reduced a lot of that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.560 
in fact it has it reduced a lot of that
noise<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.890> Distortion

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
noise and that Distortion

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.330 
noise and that Distortion
and<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> sounds<00:02:25.110> quite<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.440> better<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.070> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and it sounds quite a bit better now and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.620 
and it sounds quite a bit better now and
now<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.490> understand<00:02:26.940> why<00:02:27.120> some<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.510> other

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
now I understand why some of the other

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.940 
now I understand why some of the other
reviewers<00:02:28.050> were<00:02:28.200> giving<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> pretty<00:02:28.770> high

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
reviewers were giving it pretty high

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.390 
reviewers were giving it pretty high
marks<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.260> an<00:02:31.410> all-or-nothing<00:02:31.530> kind

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
marks so it's not an all-or-nothing kind

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.680 
marks so it's not an all-or-nothing kind
of<00:02:32.490> thing<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.760> other<00:02:32.820> words<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.300> battery's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
of thing in other words if the battery's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.960 
of thing in other words if the battery's
running<00:02:34.140> down<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.430> necessarily<00:02:35.850> going

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
running down it's not necessarily going

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.400 
running down it's not necessarily going
to<00:02:36.030> cut<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> microphone<00:02:36.720> off<00:02:36.870> right<00:02:37.080> away<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
to cut the microphone off right away so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.470 
to cut the microphone off right away so
you<00:02:38.250> need<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.460> kind<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.700> keep<00:02:38.820> an<00:02:39.000> eye<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.270> that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you need to kind of keep an eye on that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.940 
you need to kind of keep an eye on that
so<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.960> is<00:02:40.080> one<00:02:40.230> gotcha<00:02:40.650> with<00:02:40.800> this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so that is one gotcha with this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.650 
so that is one gotcha with this
microphone<00:02:41.490> but<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.270> put<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> fresh

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
microphone but if you do put a fresh

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.720 
microphone but if you do put a fresh
battery<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.170> again<00:02:43.380> great<00:02:43.770> sound<00:02:44.040> one<00:02:44.580> other

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
battery and again great sound one other

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.780 
battery and again great sound one other
thing<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.090> do<00:02:45.150> find<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.750> still<00:02:45.780> need<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.790> equalize

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
thing I do find I still need to equalize

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.940 
thing I do find I still need to equalize
the<00:02:48.000> sound<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.300> little<00:02:48.330> bit<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.590> little

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the sound a little bit to get a little

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
the sound a little bit to get a little
bit<00:02:50.040> closer<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.430> actual<00:02:51.090> sound<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
bit closer to the actual sound that I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.960 
bit closer to the actual sound that I
was<00:02:51.720> hoping<00:02:51.990> for<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.820> really

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
was hoping for and I just do that really

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.030 
was hoping for and I just do that really
quickly<00:02:54.270> by<00:02:54.480> notching<00:02:54.960> down<00:02:55.170> four<00:02:55.710> to<00:02:55.800> six

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
quickly by notching down four to six

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.510 
quickly by notching down four to six
decibels<00:02:56.460> in<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.060> 1k<00:02:57.840> range<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:59.040> lot<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
decibels in the 1k range a lot of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.400 
decibels in the 1k range a lot of
different<00:02:59.730> programs<00:02:59.850> can<00:03:00.270> do<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.840> lot<00:03:01.260> of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
different programs can do that a lot of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.470 
different programs can do that a lot of
times<00:03:01.590> your<00:03:01.830> video<00:03:02.130> editor<00:03:02.490> will<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:02.970> but

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
times your video editor will do that but

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.150 
times your video editor will do that but
if<00:03:03.600> not<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.050> always<00:03:04.170> take<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:04.710> before

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
if not you can always take it in before

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.060 
if not you can always take it in before
you<00:03:05.400> sync<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.120> audio<00:03:06.570> with<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:06.930> video<00:03:07.200> into

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
you sync the audio with your video into

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.530 
you sync the audio with your video into

applications out there great one that I
use<00:03:11.460> is<00:03:11.490> Reaper<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:13.050> relatively

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
use is Reaper it is relatively

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.800 
use is Reaper it is relatively
inexpensive<00:03:14.270> there's<00:03:15.270> another<00:03:15.420> microphone

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
inexpensive there's another microphone

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.380 
inexpensive there's another microphone
in<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.470> price<00:03:16.770> range<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.430> looks<00:03:18.180> pretty

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
in this price range that looks pretty

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.910 
in this price range that looks pretty
interesting<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.260> I'll<00:03:19.440> probably<00:03:19.650> be

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
interesting that I'll probably be

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.770 
interesting that I'll probably be
reviewing<00:03:20.550> in<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.730> next<00:03:20.940> few<00:03:21.150> weeks<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.630> if

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
reviewing in the next few weeks here if

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.440 
reviewing in the next few weeks here if
I<00:03:21.900> get<00:03:22.050> my<00:03:22.140> hands<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.470> one<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.460> is<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> the
