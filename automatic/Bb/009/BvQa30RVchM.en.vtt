the<00:00:46.620> whole<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.250> would<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.370> best<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the whole thing it would be best if I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.369 
the whole thing it would be best if I
plumbed<00:00:48.440> duct<00:00:49.440> work<00:00:49.680> overhead<00:00:51.079> that<00:00:52.079> drops

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
plumbed duct work overhead that drops

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.029 
plumbed duct work overhead that drops
drops<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> each<00:00:53.610> tool<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:55.039> couldn't

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
drops down to each tool so I couldn't

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.420 
drops down to each tool so I couldn't
find<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.809> shroud<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.170> pointer<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.129> built

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
find a shroud for my pointer so I built

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.320 
find a shroud for my pointer so I built
this<00:01:03.049> which<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.290> soon<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.979> wood<00:01:05.970> comes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
this which as soon as the wood comes

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.539 
this which as soon as the wood comes
through<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.439> shavings<00:01:07.950> will<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
through the shavings will go into this

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
through the shavings will go into this
box<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.990> dust<00:01:10.229> collector<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.770> suck<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
box and the dust collector will suck it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.450 
box and the dust collector will suck it
up

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
up

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240

over here it'll run down here and it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.210

because I'm not using both of them at
the<00:02:37.140> same<00:02:37.230> time<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.860> may<00:02:38.459> go<00:02:38.610> ahead<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.760> put<00:02:38.970> two

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the same time I may go ahead and put two

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.289 
the same time I may go ahead and put two
glass<00:02:39.330> gates<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.989> don't<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:41.120> trunk<00:02:42.120> line

glass gates on I don't know trunk line

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.970 
glass gates on I don't know trunk line
will<00:02:42.510> run<00:02:42.690> down<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.319> then<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.560> will<00:02:43.680> go<00:02:43.830> off

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
will run down and then it will go off

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.720 
will run down and then it will go off
that<00:02:44.280> way<00:02:44.599> over<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> radial<00:02:46.110> arm<00:02:46.260> saw<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that way over to the radial arm saw it

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.729 
that way over to the radial arm saw it
will<00:02:47.910> drop<00:02:48.090> down<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.540> blast<00:02:48.840> gate<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.380> a

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
will drop down to a blast gate and a

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.140 
will drop down to a blast gate and a
flex<00:02:50.010> hose<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.250> then<00:02:53.459> I'll<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.730> another<00:02:53.970> one

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
flex hose and then I'll have another one

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.080 
flex hose and then I'll have another one
dropping<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.799> table<00:02:56.130> saw<00:02:56.310> although

dropping here for the table saw although

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.280 
dropping here for the table saw although
I<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:57.269> know<00:02:57.480> if<00:02:57.569> I'm<00:02:57.690> gonna<00:02:57.810> hook<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.170> up

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
I don't know if I'm gonna hook it up

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.710 
I don't know if I'm gonna hook it up
just<00:02:58.560> right<00:02:58.739> yet<00:02:59.209> because<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.420> particular

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
just right yet because this particular

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.850 
just right yet because this particular
saw<00:03:01.079> doesn't<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.130> place<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.860> dust

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860

collection hookup it's got a big hole in
the<00:03:07.019> back<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.620> I'm<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:08.700> to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the back of it I'm going to going to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
the back of it I'm going to going to
fabricate<00:03:09.180> up<00:03:09.329> some<00:03:09.540> plywood<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.110> close<00:03:10.290> that

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
fabricate up some plywood to close that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.309 
fabricate up some plywood to close that
off<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.950> concentrate<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> dust<00:03:12.260> at<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
off and concentrate the dust at the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.890 
off and concentrate the dust at the
bottom<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> can<00:03:15.060> plug<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.390> dust<00:03:15.599> collector

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
bottom so I can plug the dust collector

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.430 
bottom so I can plug the dust collector
up<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:17.160> don't<00:03:17.310> know<00:03:17.489> right<00:03:17.640> now<00:03:18.440> but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
up I just don't know right now but

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.080 
up I just don't know right now but
anyhow<00:03:20.090> I'll<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.209> hooking<00:03:21.389> up<00:03:21.600> one<00:03:21.870> two<00:03:23.090> three

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
anyhow I'll be hooking up one two three

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.660 
anyhow I'll be hooking up one two three
four<00:03:25.100> five<00:03:26.100> six<00:03:26.609> tools<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.359> right<00:03:27.510> now<00:03:28.670> so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
four five six tools as of right now so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.770 
four five six tools as of right now so
that's<00:03:29.850> what's<00:03:30.060> happening<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.450> Woody's

here's what we got done today on the

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.789 
here's what we got done today on the
dust<00:03:37.350> collector<00:03:37.680> duct<00:03:38.549> work

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
dust collector duct work

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.490 

we<00:03:41.430> worked<00:03:41.670> probably<00:03:41.940> six<00:03:42.389> seven<00:03:42.450> hours<00:03:43.049> and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
we worked probably six seven hours and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.250 
we worked probably six seven hours and
there<00:03:44.130> was<00:03:44.250> some<00:03:44.370> stuff<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:44.790> had<00:03:45.139> you<00:03:46.139> know

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
there was some stuff we had you know

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.620 
there was some stuff we had you know
work<00:03:46.500> around<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.040> stuff<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:48.450> got<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
work around and stuff so but we got a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.090 
work around and stuff so but we got a
pretty<00:03:48.840> good<00:03:48.900> bit<00:03:49.170> accomplished<00:03:49.620> today<00:03:49.859> let's

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
pretty good bit accomplished today let's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.910 
pretty good bit accomplished today let's
start<00:03:50.370> over<00:03:50.579> there<00:03:51.799> where<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.889> dust

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
start over there where the dust

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.789 
start over there where the dust
collector<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.230> let<00:03:55.380> me<00:03:55.410> show<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.650> what

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
collector is now so let me show you what

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.759 
collector is now so let me show you what
we<00:03:55.920> got<00:03:56.069> done<00:03:57.590> all<00:03:58.590> right

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
we got done all right

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.110 
we got done all right
originally<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.310> was<00:03:59.459> gonna<00:03:59.609> put<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.940> dust

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
originally I was gonna put the dust

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.720 
originally I was gonna put the dust
collector<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.739> then<00:04:02.400> run<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
collector there and then run the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.690 
collector there and then run the
plumbing<00:04:02.910> up<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:04.079> we<00:04:04.829> had<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> better<00:04:05.220> idea<00:04:05.310> I'd

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
plumbing up but we had a better idea I'd

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.559 
plumbing up but we had a better idea I'd
actually<00:04:06.060> thought<00:04:06.209> about<00:04:06.269> this<00:04:07.489> previously

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
actually thought about this previously

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.699 
actually thought about this previously
and<00:04:09.650> we've<00:04:10.650> decided<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:12.290> move<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.470> dust

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
and we've decided to move the dust

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.750 
and we've decided to move the dust
collector<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:15.979> so<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.070> dust<00:04:17.280> collector<00:04:17.579> is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
collector here so the dust collector is

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.610 
collector here so the dust collector is
going<00:04:17.910> here<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:20.789> we<00:04:20.940> started<00:04:21.299> off<00:04:21.620> with

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
going here and then we started off with

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.130 
going here and then we started off with
a<00:04:22.680> why

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:35.610 

up<00:04:27.250> over<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.660> then<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.740> will<00:04:33.950> elbow<00:04:34.310> down

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
up over and then it will elbow down

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.990 
up over and then it will elbow down
there's<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.740> elbow<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.310> can<00:04:37.490> get<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.700> put<00:04:37.880> up

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
there's the elbow I can get it put up

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.440 
there's the elbow I can get it put up
yet

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
yet

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.490 
yet
it'll<00:04:38.930> elbow<00:04:39.170> down<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.860> Mota<00:04:40.040> box<00:04:40.340> and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
it'll elbow down to the Mota box and

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.750 
it'll elbow down to the Mota box and
then<00:04:42.580> comes<00:04:43.580> over<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.120> then<00:04:45.020> it'll<00:04:45.200> drop<00:04:45.410> down

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
then comes over and then it'll drop down

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:53.320 
then comes over and then it'll drop down
to<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.880> drum<00:04:47.090> sander<00:04:48.790> then<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.970> continues<00:04:52.330> T's

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
to the drum sander then it continues T's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.930 
to the drum sander then it continues T's
right<00:04:53.660> there<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.770> will<00:04:54.980> drop<00:04:55.250> down<00:04:55.520> to

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
right there if that will drop down to

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.400 
right there if that will drop down to
the<00:04:56.360> planer<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:57.350> jointer<00:04:59.230> there'll<00:05:00.230> also

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
the planer and the jointer there'll also

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.370 
the planer and the jointer there'll also
be<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.710> splitter<00:05:01.340> there<00:05:01.610> like<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.420> one<00:05:02.630> and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
be a splitter there like that one and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.500 
be a splitter there like that one and
there'll<00:05:04.010> be<00:05:04.040> two<00:05:04.460> blast<00:05:04.760> gates<00:05:05.060> on<00:05:05.300> ever

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
there'll be two blast gates on ever

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.120 
there'll be two blast gates on ever
decided<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.870> put<00:05:06.050> two<00:05:06.200> blast<00:05:06.500> gates<00:05:06.770> on<00:05:06.980> it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
decided to put two blast gates on it

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.360 
decided to put two blast gates on it
instead<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.550> one<00:05:08.710> then<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:09.830> continues

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
instead of just one then it continues

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.990 
instead of just one then it continues
down<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:13.130> makes<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.490> turn<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.870> I've<00:05:14.960> also<00:05:15.140> got<00:05:15.470> a

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
down it makes a turn and I've also got a

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.910 
down it makes a turn and I've also got a
cap<00:05:17.000> right<00:05:17.210> there<00:05:17.270> on<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.660> end<00:05:17.870> that'll<00:05:18.680> be<00:05:18.890> a

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
cap right there on the end that'll be a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
cap right there on the end that'll be a
clean-out<00:05:19.540> cap<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:20.870> that'll<00:05:21.140> also<00:05:21.470> double<00:05:21.940> if

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
clean-out cap and that'll also double if

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.050 
clean-out cap and that'll also double if
I<00:05:23.120> if<00:05:23.360> I<00:05:23.480> get<00:05:23.630> another<00:05:23.870> two<00:05:24.110> later<00:05:25.060> that'll

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
I if I get another two later that'll

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.430 
I if I get another two later that'll
also<00:05:26.180> double<00:05:26.870> as<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.110> section<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:28.010> runoff<00:05:29.440> to

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
also double as a section to runoff to

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.570 
also double as a section to runoff to
hook<00:05:31.310> up<00:05:31.490> another<00:05:31.610> tool<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.450> future<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:34.430> it

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
hook up another tool in the future so it

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.710 
hook up another tool in the future so it
comes<00:05:34.760> down<00:05:35.060> that'll<00:05:35.720> be<00:05:35.810> my<00:05:35.960> table<00:05:36.320> salt<00:05:36.500> drop

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
comes down that'll be my table salt drop

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.560 
comes down that'll be my table salt drop
which<00:05:38.720> is<00:05:38.750> right<00:05:39.050> there<00:05:39.790> be<00:05:40.790> a<00:05:40.820> blast<00:05:41.090> gate<00:05:41.390> and

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
which is right there be a blast gate and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.970 
which is right there be a blast gate and
flex<00:05:41.870> everything<00:05:42.320> will<00:05:42.440> be<00:05:42.530> hooked<00:05:42.710> up<00:05:42.860> with

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
flex everything will be hooked up with

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.830 
flex everything will be hooked up with
flex<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:44.570> then<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.840> 90s<00:05:45.200> over<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:47.330> then<00:05:47.510> drops

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
flex and then it 90s over and then drops

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.050 
flex and then it 90s over and then drops
down<00:05:47.960> here<00:05:49.960> to<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.110> radial<00:05:51.530> arm<00:05:51.680> saw<00:05:52.060> which

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
down here to the radial arm saw which

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.230 
down here to the radial arm saw which
will<00:05:53.240> also<00:05:53.390> have<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.890> blast<00:05:54.890> gate<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.460> flex<00:05:56.060> on

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
will also have a blast gate and flex on

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.440 
will also have a blast gate and flex on
it<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:58.190> all<00:05:58.340> in<00:05:58.550> all<00:05:58.670> I'd<00:05:58.910> say<00:05:58.940> we<00:05:59.270> did<00:05:59.300> pretty

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
it it's all in all I'd say we did pretty

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.180 
it it's all in all I'd say we did pretty
good<00:05:59.690> for<00:05:59.870> today<00:06:00.170> and<00:06:02.530> got<00:06:03.530> everything<00:06:03.890> taped

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
good for today and got everything taped

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.870 
good for today and got everything taped
sealed<00:06:07.090> not<00:06:08.090> very<00:06:08.330> bad<00:06:08.690> progress<00:06:09.170> for<00:06:09.350> today

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
sealed not very bad progress for today

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.990 
sealed not very bad progress for today
I've<00:06:10.880> got<00:06:10.940> some<00:06:12.160> I've<00:06:13.160> got<00:06:13.370> some<00:06:13.610> things<00:06:13.850> I've

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
I've got some I've got some things I've

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.610 
I've got some I've got some things I've
got<00:06:14.180> to<00:06:14.300> build<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:14.900> I<00:06:14.960> got<00:06:15.170> some<00:06:15.320> things<00:06:15.560> to

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
got to build and I got some things to

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.350 
got to build and I got some things to
get<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.830> modify<00:06:16.660> but<00:06:17.660> that's<00:06:17.870> just<00:06:17.990> part<00:06:18.290> of<00:06:18.410> it

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
get a modify but that's just part of it

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.780 
get a modify but that's just part of it
so

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
so

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.440 
so
as<00:06:22.790> you<00:06:22.940> can<00:06:23.090> see<00:06:23.270> our<00:06:24.730> our<00:06:25.730> materials<00:06:26.240> have

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
as you can see our our materials have

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.590 
as you can see our our materials have
thinned<00:06:26.690> down<00:06:26.840> tremendously<00:06:28.270> I'm<00:06:29.270> gonna<00:06:29.480> have

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
thinned down tremendously I'm gonna have

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.170 
thinned down tremendously I'm gonna have
to<00:06:29.690> have<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.840> few<00:06:30.080> more<00:06:30.200> parts<00:06:30.850> and<00:06:31.850> that's<00:06:31.940> all

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
to have a few more parts and that's all

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.520 
to have a few more parts and that's all
the<00:06:32.300> pipe<00:06:32.480> I<00:06:32.630> got<00:06:32.840> left<00:06:33.110> which<00:06:33.320> would<00:06:33.410> be

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
the pipe I got left which would be

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.210 
the pipe I got left which would be
plenty<00:06:33.890> to<00:06:33.980> do<00:06:34.100> what<00:06:34.250> I<00:06:34.280> got<00:06:34.490> to<00:06:34.520> do<00:06:36.070> so<00:06:37.070> as<00:06:37.130> you

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
plenty to do what I got to do so as you

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.620 
plenty to do what I got to do so as you
can<00:06:37.460> see<00:06:37.520> we<00:06:37.760> made<00:06:37.910> some<00:06:38.090> serious<00:06:38.330> headway

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
can see we made some serious headway

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.830 
can see we made some serious headway
today<00:06:39.080> and<00:06:39.950> hopefully<00:06:40.760> this<00:06:41.180> week<00:06:41.390> I'll<00:06:41.660> get

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
today and hopefully this week I'll get

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.030 
today and hopefully this week I'll get
the<00:06:42.350> rest<00:06:42.500> of<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.830> stuff<00:06:44.110> plumb<00:06:45.110> down<00:06:45.350> and<00:06:45.770> the

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
the rest of the stuff plumb down and the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.730 
the rest of the stuff plumb down and the
blast<00:06:46.280> gates<00:06:46.550> put<00:06:46.820> in<00:06:46.970> when<00:06:47.120> they<00:06:47.240> come<00:06:47.270> in<00:06:47.740> and

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
blast gates put in when they come in and

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.520 
blast gates put in when they come in and
I'll<00:06:48.980> get<00:06:49.190> the<00:06:49.280> flex<00:06:49.520> hooked<00:06:49.760> up<00:06:50.030> and<00:06:50.750> it<00:06:51.380> might
