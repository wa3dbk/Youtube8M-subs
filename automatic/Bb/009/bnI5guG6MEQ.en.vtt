00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi, how are you? We're going to have another video. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.300
 this week and today was to show 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 You guys are an awesome epauletador pa 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 I liked those times of my year. 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.770
 stadium a photo of this coach and all 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.710
 world was delighted everyone loved it 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.630
 I decided to make a tutorial for you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 just shows how I did it then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.240
 Look there is a seeder and a well 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.039
 graphic and the mouth I'm 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.130
 using amac diva 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.140
 Okay, so I started preparing my 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 skin with the chemical base of the menini itÃ¡ 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.610
 for oily skins 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 a very fine texture on the skin and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm loving it, I do not even need the powder. 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 then to finish 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.640
 after the recreational making off of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 count one gram of salmon color on top 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.960
 the salmon concealer I used a kiss 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 always my nc 30 happy studio with you 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.510
 read from Amac and to do with the owner of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 I used brf squid as an illuminator 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 used miner on ice queen finish in the mec 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.790
 color software and anton here on top of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.570
 cheekbones 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.460
 I used the palette nei that lets say 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.009
 it's neither field right 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.150
 so I used the green color this 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:31.799
 first time here and I used boc that this 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.530
 here this hand 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.590
 so I used only those two colors and the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.150
 eyeliner to make this outlined I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.610
 I used to abuse eyeliner tac is this 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 here is the liner club in another black of 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.869
 band joah who is very thin but he is 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.259
 harder to handle so he already good 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.750
 there it has to be with a sharp and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.030
 but so my suggestion to who 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.579
 want an easier eyeliner and such is 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.430
 use eyeliner pen I think 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.140
 It's great, it's wonderful, I just 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.670
 I do not know you tutorial because it's the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.659
 my head is getting more 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 sequine 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.069
 so I could not use it but the pen 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.489
 table 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.840
 black panvel is wonderful little corner 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.180
 here gives very thin to make quiet 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.549
 won the beauty 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.590
 Ok folks, then you play in the tutorial. 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.950
 let's see how I did it here I 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.349
 I'll start by using the green color of the palette 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:36.829
 urban decay on the movable eyelid and logo 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.650
 It's enough for weeks, too. 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.810
 Little trick here, yes, it 's very light with 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.389
 this leftover clarinet 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.510
 now i'll use shadow book which is a 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.790
 clarinha brown so the same 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.579
 Palette knock remove excess 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.889
 brush shadow and I'll mark it and if 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.870
 car that is very light, it's just for one. 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.400
 civil zinha tag does not get that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.989
 light color very plated with carrot 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:12.049
 so there are very few shoulders in the brush and 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.709
 mist goods as dinho just like this 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.229
 Ukulele now use eyeliner 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.430
 I'd rather not even close my eyes and do with 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:25.359
 them and is open does not give one rollaway 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.359
 eye tight 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.890
 now i made this eyeliner a na 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:42.560
 I'm going to pull him on that movable eyelid. 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.370
 Lateral here I'll do this pulled well 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.200
 long so always taking care to avoid 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:57.890
 just like the other side is 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:59.390
 both sides have the same status now 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.909
 I'm going to make another 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.319
 accompanying this fold of the 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:13.700
 Look at this hand, look well as she 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:25.220
 I'm going to draw here right in the middle of the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:35.900
 Fight is making a wine color and now 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:39.470
 joining these two tips by filling the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.849
 And now I'm just going to put these two together. 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.849
 dots here 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.020
 only you want to give to give a finish 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.660
 also here down very slightly in 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.780
 corner of the eye and now to finish 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.250
 this eye I will wear a mask to 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:07.699
 This is her clinic eyelashes. 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.340
 incredible superdifferent mask tomorrow 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.180
 I'll send her, how's the little school? 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.919
 she's inactive yet it's not done yet 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.490
 that she has but she is incredible 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:25.370
 then I will apply it here to this school 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:30.410
 super lightweight children not volume 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.110
 wonderful leaves well raised and there 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.199
 then allow it to dry a little yes 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.750
 to the seconds can pass without 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.120
 very good product and open it always 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.980
 Leaves a large pencil for eyes 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:49.350
 kiss 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:52.540
 to make the eye well clear 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.150
 illuminated so more open 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.860
 so that's it , it's ready look and I hope 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.290
 that you liked eyeliner 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.850
 wonderful and I think it's amazing 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.740
 something geometric and when people 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.690
 open the eye forward 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.220
 it seems normal to study that 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.280
 Looked down, everybody came. 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.230
 so anyway I wanted to be a coach 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.420
 so we'll take advantage of entering the 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.340
 wave of graphics and enjoy a lot 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.630
 this in engineering is not that I think 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.600
 It's cool, we can make a 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.400
 Pretty cool production and wearing a lipstick use 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.080
 mouth 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.920
 Okay, so I hope you have 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.780
 liked 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.780
 until the next video bye
