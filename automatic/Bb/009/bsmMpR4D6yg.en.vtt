00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
graffle into a jet plane I think that's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.490 
graffle into a jet plane I think that's
penultimate<00:02:15.950> one<00:02:16.340> will<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.760> popular<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.500> 9-inch

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
penultimate one will be popular a 9-inch

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.160 
penultimate one will be popular a 9-inch
Rico<00:02:18.980> Rodriguez<00:02:19.550> figure<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.300> magnetic<00:02:20.750> feet

Rico Rodriguez figure with magnetic feet

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.230 
Rico Rodriguez figure with magnetic feet
so<00:02:21.530> he<00:02:21.650> can<00:02:21.770> grapple<00:02:22.040> onto<00:02:22.370> almost<00:02:22.730> anything

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
so he can grapple onto almost anything

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.470 
so he can grapple onto almost anything
and<00:02:23.480> stay<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:25.430> final<00:02:25.640> one<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.180> quite

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
