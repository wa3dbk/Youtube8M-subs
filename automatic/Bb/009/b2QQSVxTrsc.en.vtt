00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
May well knowing Rockstar that probably

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
May well knowing Rockstar that probably
means<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.560> it'll<00:01:22.770> be<00:01:22.890> May<00:01:23.280> thirtieth<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:24.030> May

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
means that it'll be May thirtieth or May

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
means that it'll be May thirtieth or May
31st<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.049> even<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.650> many<00:01:25.740> days<00:01:25.979> in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
31st if there even are that many days in

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
31st if there even are that many days in
May<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.330> Noah<00:01:27.540> rocks<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:27.990> they're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
May but you know Noah rocks are they're

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
May but you know Noah rocks are they're
probably<00:01:28.320> gonna<00:01:28.500> milk<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.070> long<00:01:29.280> as

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
probably gonna milk it as long as

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.800 
probably gonna milk it as long as
possible<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.000> they're<00:01:30.270> awful<00:01:30.659> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
possible because they're awful with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.109 
possible because they're awful with
releasing<00:01:31.229> things<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.460> hey<00:01:32.700> that's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
releasing things on time but hey that's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.310 
releasing things on time but hey that's
better<00:01:33.240> than<00:01:33.509> nothing<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.930> finally<00:01:34.170> some

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
better than nothing that's finally some

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.600 
better than nothing that's finally some
information<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.920> finally<00:01:35.250> something<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
information it's finally something to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
information it's finally something to
look<00:01:35.759> forward<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.869> fact<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
look forward to and the fact that this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
look forward to and the fact that this
is<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.799> come<00:01:38.040> out<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> month<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.579> May

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
is going to come out in the month of May

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
is going to come out in the month of May
kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.329> reinforces<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:39.900> theory<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
kind of reinforces my theory that we

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
kind of reinforces my theory that we
will<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.920> seeing<00:01:41.159> heists<00:01:41.610> come<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.210> June

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
will be seeing heists come out in June

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.090 
will be seeing heists come out in June
that's<00:01:43.350> kind<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.649> I've<00:01:43.770> been<00:01:43.920> thinking

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that's kind of what I've been thinking

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.679 
that's kind of what I've been thinking
lately<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> made<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> video<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
lately and I made a video about it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210
