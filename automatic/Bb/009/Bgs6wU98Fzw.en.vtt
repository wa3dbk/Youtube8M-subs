00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.809

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.809

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.979

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.880

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:21.539
 with a scratch nail file on my 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 nail file is a nail file 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:33.619

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.619
 who was originally 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.840
 a whole turning point here and you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.150

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.069
 of strips with paper 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.180
 think but it's just paper to 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.670
 sandpaper then nail file paper to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.299

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.019
 Linked to various Greek 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.680
