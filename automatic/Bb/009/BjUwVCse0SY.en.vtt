00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.999 
and just give it another coat right over
that<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:08.849> sealing<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.229> side<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that so we're sealing the other side of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.490 
that so we're sealing the other side of
our<00:02:11.819> designers

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
our designers

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.560 
our designers
paper<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.550> can<00:02:13.670> go<00:02:13.790> right<00:02:13.970> up<00:02:14.150> against

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
paper and you can go right up against

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.210 
paper and you can go right up against
the<00:02:14.720> glass<00:02:15.280> gem<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:16.610> no<00:02:17.030> problem<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.220> then

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the glass gem that's no problem and then

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.160 
the glass gem that's no problem and then
we've<00:02:19.430> got<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:19.880> ahead<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.480> set<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.960> aside

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
we've got to go ahead and set that aside

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.640 
we've got to go ahead and set that aside
to<00:02:21.860> dry<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.730> once<00:02:23.300> that's<00:02:23.540> dry<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:24.230> only<00:02:24.380> have

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
to dry and once that's dry we only have

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.160 
to dry and once that's dry we only have
one<00:02:24.680> last<00:02:25.220> step<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.330> just<00:02:26.540> need<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.870> turn

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
one last step to do we just need to turn

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.590 
one last step to do we just need to turn
our<00:02:27.560> magnet<00:02:28.040> over<00:02:28.250> we're<00:02:29.000> going<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.330> add<00:02:29.570> some

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
our magnet over we're going to add some

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.160 
our magnet over we're going to add some
crystal<00:02:30.530> effects<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> back<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.810> attach

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
crystal effects to the back to attach

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.980 
crystal effects to the back to attach
our<00:02:33.470> ceramic<00:02:33.920> disc<00:02:34.370> magnet<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.780> just

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
our ceramic disc magnet and I'm just

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.440 
our ceramic disc magnet and I'm just
using<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.410> half<00:02:36.650> inch<00:02:36.680> ceramic<00:02:37.340> dis<00:02:37.880> magnet

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
using a half inch ceramic dis magnet

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.170 
using a half inch ceramic dis magnet
then<00:02:39.020> I'm<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.440> pressing<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.700> back<00:02:40.910> if

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
then I'm just pressing on to the back if

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.150 
then I'm just pressing on to the back if
you<00:02:41.780> want<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.050> protect<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:42.590> metallic

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
you want to protect your metallic

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.390 
you want to protect your metallic
surfaces<00:02:43.820> from<00:02:44.450> getting<00:02:44.870> scratched<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:46.160> last

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
surfaces from getting scratched the last

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.880 
surfaces from getting scratched the last
thing<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.820> could<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.330> punch<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.320> half<00:02:48.650> inch

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
thing you could do is punch a half inch

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.520 
thing you could do is punch a half inch
circle<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.640> your<00:02:49.970> designer<00:02:50.390> series<00:02:50.720> paper<00:02:50.900> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
circle of your designer series paper and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.740 
circle of your designer series paper and
we<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.100> go<00:02:52.220> ahead<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.550> add<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.540> back

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
we can go ahead and add that to the back

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.870 
we can go ahead and add that to the back
of<00:02:53.959> our<00:02:54.050> magnet<00:02:54.530> with<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> little<00:02:55.310> dab<00:02:55.610> of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
of our magnet with a little dab of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.540 
of our magnet with a little dab of
crystal<00:02:56.570> effects<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.709> way<00:02:57.890> once<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.280> start

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
crystal effects that way once you start

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.920 
crystal effects that way once you start
using<00:02:58.700> your<00:02:58.910> magnet<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.540> don't<00:02:59.690> actually

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
using your magnet you don't actually

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.680 
using your magnet you don't actually
have<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.470> magnet<00:03:00.860> itself<00:03:01.300> rubbing<00:03:02.300> against

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
have the magnet itself rubbing against

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.870 
have the magnet itself rubbing against
your<00:03:02.750> metallic<00:03:03.350> surfaces<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.220> I'm<00:03:04.670> just

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
your metallic surfaces and I'm just

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.610 
your metallic surfaces and I'm just
going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.060> go<00:03:05.209> ahead<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.570> set<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.810> aside<00:03:05.989> to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
going to go ahead and set that aside to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.540 
going to go ahead and set that aside to
dry<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.630> have<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.800> simple

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
dry so there you have it a really simple

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.240 
dry so there you have it a really simple
project<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.390> make<00:03:11.570> adorable<00:03:12.350> little<00:03:12.770> magnets

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
project to make adorable little magnets

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.030 
project to make adorable little magnets
using<00:03:13.640> your<00:03:13.790> designer<00:03:14.150> series<00:03:14.480> paper<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:15.140> hope

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040
