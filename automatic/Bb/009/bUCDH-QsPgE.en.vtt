00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
pretty ah so I thought for today's video

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.080 
pretty ah so I thought for today's video
we<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.619> another<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.130> those<00:00:26.310> let's<00:00:26.789> draw

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
we do another one of those let's draw

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
we do another one of those let's draw
things<00:00:27.660> why<00:00:28.230> would<00:00:28.560> uh<00:00:28.590> I've<00:00:29.400> done<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.910> draw

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
things why would uh I've done one draw

in<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.599> far<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.109> thought<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> would

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
in here so far and I thought I would

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
in here so far and I thought I would
give<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:32.009> time<00:00:32.250> lapse<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> bet

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
give you a time lapse of it so I bet

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.549
