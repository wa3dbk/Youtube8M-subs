00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
territory but I think the last thing

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.610 
territory but I think the last thing
about<00:01:07.700> having<00:01:08.450> spent<00:01:08.840> some<00:01:09.020> time<00:01:09.080> with<00:01:09.380> such

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.469 
about having spent some time with such
an<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:09.950> worked<00:01:10.130> with<00:01:10.250> him<00:01:10.460> was<00:01:10.729> he's

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
an and worked with him was he's

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.500 
an and worked with him was he's
receptiveness<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.950> new<00:01:13.100> ideas<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.760> I

receptiveness you to new ideas and I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.330 
receptiveness you to new ideas and I
