00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:08.549 
in this video I wanted to show you how

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.580 
in this video I wanted to show you how
I've<00:00:08.670> made<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.630> sort<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.930> rows<00:00:10.200> were<00:00:10.410> full

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I've made this sort of rows were full

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.280 
I've made this sort of rows were full
effect<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.100> the<00:00:11.190> side<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> my<00:00:11.580> cake<00:00:11.790> now<00:00:12.200> at<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
effect on the side of my cake now at the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.120 
effect on the side of my cake now at the
moment<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.219> half<00:00:14.519> finished<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:16.070> so<00:00:17.070> I've

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
moment it's half finished and so I've

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
moment it's half finished and so I've
done<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.460> front<00:00:17.730> half<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.570> thought<00:00:18.779> I'd

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
done the front half and I thought I'd

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.840 
done the front half and I thought I'd
get<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> video<00:00:19.800> recorder<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.609> show<00:00:20.789> you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
get the video recorder out to show you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
get the video recorder out to show you
the<00:00:21.570> second<00:00:21.900> half<00:00:22.050> subset<00:00:22.500> I'll<00:00:22.680> put<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the second half subset I'll put a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.250 
the second half subset I'll put a
different<00:00:23.130> angle<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.520> what<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> usually<00:00:23.820> would

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
different angle to what I usually would

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.599 
different angle to what I usually would
so<00:00:25.260> hopefully<00:00:25.680> it'll<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:26.010> okay

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so hopefully it'll be okay

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.929 
so hopefully it'll be okay

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.760 
then we'll stick our next layer just
inside<00:05:03.850> puff<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.930> can<00:05:08.080> try<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.320> with<00:05:08.410> longer

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
inside puff you can try it with longer

inside puff you can try it with longer
pieces<00:05:08.980> if<00:05:09.250> you<00:05:09.370> find<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.790> easier<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:13.690> again

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
pieces if you find it easier so again

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.350 
pieces if you find it easier so again
coming<00:05:16.270> inside<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.500> if<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.920> want<00:05:18.070> to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360

concertina<00:05:19.360> it<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:19.690> little<00:05:19.870> bit<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.200> can<00:05:20.410> do<00:05:23.430> so

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
concertina it a little bit you can do so

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.460 
concertina it a little bit you can do so
I'm<00:05:24.670> just<00:05:24.880> pushing<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.360> in<00:05:25.540> so<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.050> don't<00:05:26.170> have

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
I'm just pushing it in so you don't have

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.970 
I'm just pushing it in so you don't have
to<00:05:26.710> be<00:05:27.300> particularly<00:05:28.300> neat<00:05:28.660> with<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.470> I'll<00:05:29.770> try

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
to be particularly neat with it I'll try

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.470 
to be particularly neat with it I'll try
and<00:05:30.070> pull<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.370> up<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:30.910> can<00:05:31.120> see<00:05:31.330> the

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
and pull that up so you can see the

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.800 
and pull that up so you can see the
layer<00:05:32.470> below<00:05:39.060> you<00:05:40.060> just<00:05:40.300> want<00:05:40.480> to<00:05:40.540> make<00:05:40.780> sure

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
layer below you just want to make sure

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:49.830 
layer below you just want to make sure
that<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.200> frills<00:05:43.140> are<00:05:44.140> upwards<00:05:46.140> okay<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:48.840> now

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
that the frills are upwards okay and now

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.990 
that the frills are upwards okay and now
it's<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.110> case<00:05:50.290> of<00:05:50.320> doing<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.860> all<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:51.910> way

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
it's a case of doing that all the way

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.500 
it's a case of doing that all the way
around<00:05:53.070> you'll<00:05:54.070> find<00:05:54.340> as<00:05:54.520> we<00:05:54.640> put<00:05:54.820> more<00:05:55.060> in

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
around you'll find as we put more in

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:15.960 
around you'll find as we put more in
it<00:05:55.990> holds<00:05:56.200> these<00:05:56.590> outer<00:05:57.340> ones<00:05:57.760> off<00:06:14.970> just

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
it holds these outer ones off just

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:24.820 
it holds these outer ones off just
continuing<00:06:16.660> around

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.969 

until<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:25.949> completely<00:06:26.430> failed<00:06:28.819> the<00:06:29.819> rose<00:06:30.060> up

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:53.719 

push<00:06:34.979> it<00:06:35.160> out<00:06:35.310> a<00:06:35.340> little<00:06:35.610> bit<00:06:52.430> and<00:06:53.430> then<00:06:53.580> what

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
push it out a little bit and then what

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.450 
push it out a little bit and then what
we're<00:06:53.849> going<00:06:53.970> to<00:06:54.000> do<00:06:54.180> for<00:06:54.360> the<00:06:54.419> end<00:06:54.539> of<00:06:54.750> it<00:06:55.460> is

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
we're going to do for the end of it is

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.010 
we're going to do for the end of it is
just<00:06:56.699> sub<00:06:56.880> concertina<00:06:59.449> not<00:07:00.449> for<00:07:00.659> in<00:07:00.750> for<00:07:00.900> the

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
just sub concertina not for in for the

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:08.450 
just sub concertina not for in for the
center<00:07:01.440> so<00:07:01.949> if<00:07:02.039> it<00:07:02.159> doesn't<00:07:02.400> break<00:07:07.069> to<00:07:08.069> create

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
center so if it doesn't break to create

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.960 
center so if it doesn't break to create
a<00:07:09.289> little<00:07:10.289> bit<00:07:10.409> of<00:07:10.470> a<00:07:10.590> rose<00:07:10.770> bet<00:07:11.159> and<00:07:11.400> that<00:07:11.789> will

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
a little bit of a rose bet and that will

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.520 
a little bit of a rose bet and that will
just<00:07:12.120> slot<00:07:13.460> to<00:07:14.460> the<00:07:14.580> center<00:07:15.199> obviously<00:07:16.199> can

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
just slot to the center obviously can

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.460 
just slot to the center obviously can
spend<00:07:16.800> more<00:07:16.919> time<00:07:16.979> on<00:07:17.599> us<00:07:18.599> and<00:07:18.900> I<00:07:18.990> hope<00:07:19.169> on<00:07:19.319> that

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
spend more time on us and I hope on that

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.760 
spend more time on us and I hope on that
one<00:07:19.789> and<00:07:20.789> that<00:07:21.000> just<00:07:21.270> fill<00:07:21.479> a<00:07:21.509> new<00:07:21.720> center<00:07:22.169> spot

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
one and that just fill a new center spot

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.189 
one and that just fill a new center spot
you<00:07:22.979> can<00:07:23.220> do<00:07:23.460> it<00:07:23.599> curled<00:07:24.599> rather<00:07:25.020> than

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 
you can do it curled rather than

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.459 
you can do it curled rather than
constituted<00:07:25.969> whichever<00:07:26.969> where<00:07:27.900> you<00:07:28.050> prefer

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:28.469 
constituted whichever where you prefer

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:38.350 
constituted whichever where you prefer
and<00:07:28.620> just<00:07:28.770> make<00:07:28.949> sure<00:07:29.479> that's<00:07:30.479> in<00:07:30.750> securely

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.719 

and<00:07:39.360> that's<00:07:39.630> how<00:07:39.810> you<00:07:39.870> create<00:07:40.669> ruffled<00:07:41.669> effect

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:41.729 
and that's how you create ruffled effect

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:47.020 
and that's how you create ruffled effect
so<00:07:42.150> I'll<00:07:42.240> just<00:07:42.360> turn<00:07:42.539> the<00:07:42.690> cake<00:07:42.870> around
