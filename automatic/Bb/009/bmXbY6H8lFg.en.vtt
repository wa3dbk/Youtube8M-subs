 these many actions that you see is a 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.320
 product that I put in the seedbed 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.760
 for snails because the snails 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.250
 he loves to eat these legs seedlings 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.750

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.190
 the substrate again indicate substrate 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.860
 for seedbeds river sand 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.420

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.650

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.650
 by serves each ma 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.870
 these seeds as I say the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.100
 plant 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.950
 in 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.980
 in autumn it does not stratify them here 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.840
 as it is cold in Galicia because it does not 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.959
 lack is to certify 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.010
 xxi distinguishes I do not think you can see that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:06.610
 green dot veis veis between the zone 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.010
 blue to the corner to the right of the 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.200
 image a little green dot almost 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.930

 they indicated 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:28.009
 than when to receive the seeds in autumn 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.360
 now we are in March and it is very 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.610
 late 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.469
 If your area is not cold, you have to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.569
 put them in the fridge in a tupper with 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:38.719
 Water 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.949
 water and sand I do not decide to bury them 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:44.360
 in the sand in the tap but it's 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.390
 personado in the lower area of ​​the refrigerator 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.490
 two months 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.640

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.969
 good seedbed I hope you have 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.940
 liked 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.240
 this report 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.490
 of the first 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.830
 seeds being born 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.770
 there we will see 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.280
 in a first 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.280
 finished the seedbed and 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.940
 at the end the bottom 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.460
 the 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.610
 the seeds of last year 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.669
 this came to me under cover 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.729
 because otherwise the rain would take away or 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.789
 it would be very humid and would reach 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.430
 kill the seeds to rot the seedbed 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.169
 you always have to keep it moist but 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.629
 not in a pond or sometimes we can leave 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.370
 dry the seeds a little bit 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.759
 I hope you liked this one 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.539
