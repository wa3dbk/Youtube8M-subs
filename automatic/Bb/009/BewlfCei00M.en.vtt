00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.260
 The materials are 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.260
 paper tubes 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.189
 i 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 hair clips 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.100
 Y 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.180
 tape measure or ruler 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.180
 hot silicon gun scissors 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.620
 nail polish 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 acrylic paint the color of your 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.380
 preference 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.430
 metal or wood sticks now 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.430
 let's go to the procedure 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.590
 The first thing we have to do for the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.890
 step number 1 take the the paper tube 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.220
 and we will measure it with the tape measure 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.550
 or with the rule they have at hand 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 lives that they have to realize are of are 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.830
 of 8 millimeters each are three strips 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.830
 of that same size 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.579
 although you can do it is more 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:46.450
 great if you want that depends for the 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.840
 type of flower that will be made 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.500
 now for step number 2 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.220
 we have to cut four strips of 3 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.820
 millimeters each 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.820
 i 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.520
 we cut the strips that measure 8 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.520
 millimeters we cut them in half 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.440
 now the strips that we cut in half 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 let's try to form the petals of 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.980
 the flower joining the tips that are 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.650
 cut on the bottom with pee 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.640
 with hot silicone gun or 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.640
 glue of your preference 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.970
 for the next step we have to do 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.250
 two circles to be able to paste the 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.250
 petals or join the petals of the flower 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.940
 I love 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.820
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.250
 start to stick the petals of 11 with 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.410
 hot silicone gun help 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.410
 or the glue of your preference 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.160
 and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.160
 after having pasted all the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.370
 petals in the circle 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.730
 for this step we are going to cut a strip 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.520
 5 millimeters and we're going to cut it in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.240
 one end and we're going to take a 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.970
 skewer stick or metal stick 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.730
 have at hand and we will help 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.170
 to roll it up this is going to be the center 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.170
 of the flower 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.600
 already when we have it ready rolled 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.790
 well doneradito we are going to hit with help 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.810
 of the hot siphon gun 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.719
 now with the others the other strips that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.140
 had a reservation we're going to double 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:13.530
 half and we're going to start sticking the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.199
 petals of the flower with the help of the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.560
 hot glue gun point 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.850
 silicone in the middle of each petal we 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.850
 will stick very well 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.850
 ah 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:42.580
 now let's join all the petals 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.580
 to form the exterior of the flower 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.819
 i 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.050
 now since we have to form our flower 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.540
 we're going to stick it on the back of 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.370
 the other flower that we already had with 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.479
 Previousity made 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.810
 and we're going to hit him in our 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.060
 circle that we had cut in the 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.830
 back so you can not see the 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.830
 joints of the petals 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.480
 and for the last step almost the last 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.320
 rather we are all going to paint 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.660
 all the flower with nail polish the 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.520
 color of your preference in this case I 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.070
 I'm using a color 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.440
 light blue 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.540
 but you can use the one 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.730
 you have also can use 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.280
 Metallized acrylic paint are 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.040
 I recommend not using acrylic paint 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.890
 that does not have brightness that is not 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.870
 mentalizado because it consumes enough 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:12.560
 painting and it is very 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.990
 it is colorful or it is not neat 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.760
 painting 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:22.140
 then metal paint recommendation 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.140
 acrylic and nail polish 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.960
 now and to finish painting the whole 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.009
 so as not to stain our hands 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.879
 I'm helping with a clamp 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:41.119
 and holding the flower with the little piece of 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.710
 others removing so that we never throw 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:46.279
 although if you like it enough there is no 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.279
 problem 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.569
 I gave you two layers of paint 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.370
 they can give you the ones where they need 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:00.130
 if they see it is very bad and that 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.130
 you need more you can give it another layer 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.650
 now without for the last step we take the 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.110
 hook for hair and also gave me a 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:21.639
 minced with the same color of enamel 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:25.340
 for nails and now he pasted it on the part of 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:29.330
 behind the same silicon valley 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:34.190
 and it will be ready to be used now 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:37.690
 we leave you 22 different flowers come 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.690
 of different sizes 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.420
 thanks everyone watched the day until the 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:49.000

 by if the video liked you remember that 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.440
 You can give it from above to share it with
