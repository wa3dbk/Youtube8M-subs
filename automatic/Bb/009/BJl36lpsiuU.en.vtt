00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
we are getting more stats it looks like

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.720 
we are getting more stats it looks like
they're<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.170> giving<00:00:22.350> us<00:00:22.590> more<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.220> guess

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
they're just giving us more I guess

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.529 
they're just giving us more I guess
detailed<00:00:24.269> information<00:00:25.070> or<00:00:26.070> when<00:00:26.939> clan<00:00:27.240> wars

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
detailed information or when clan wars

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
detailed information or when clan wars
is<00:00:27.779> over<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.380> looks<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> result<00:00:29.310> spring

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is over it looks like the result spring

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.350 
is over it looks like the result spring
so<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.689> thinking<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.360> if

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so what I'm thinking is like if you if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
so what I'm thinking is like if you if
you<00:00:33.570> lose<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.559> win<00:00:34.770> they're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you lose or if you win they're going to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.450 
you lose or if you win they're going to
catalog<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.980> actually<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
catalog all that actually one thing I

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
catalog all that actually one thing I
was<00:00:38.610> thinking<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.450> before<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.170> happened

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
was thinking about before this happened

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260 
was thinking about before this happened
was<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.980> wonder<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.579> they're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> give<00:00:42.239> us

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
was I wonder if they're going to give us

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.580 
was I wonder if they're going to give us
like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.820> MVP<00:00:44.820> award<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.300> something<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.780> MVP

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
