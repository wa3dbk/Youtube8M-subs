00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.660 

at<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.710> end<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.070> day<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.310> that's<00:03:44.460> really

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
at the end of the day and that's really

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.580 
at the end of the day and that's really
what<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.120> all<00:03:45.240> about<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.110> case<00:03:46.320> of

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
what this is all about so it's a case of

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.400 
what this is all about so it's a case of
the<00:03:47.010> guys<00:03:47.190> at<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.460> back<00:03:47.640> AS<00:03:48.000> Roma<00:03:48.410> Eindhoven

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
the guys at the back AS Roma Eindhoven

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.110 
the guys at the back AS Roma Eindhoven
and<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.800> trying<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.190> come<00:03:50.370> through<00:03:50.640> not

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
and so on trying to come through not

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.580 
and so on trying to come through not
necessarily<00:03:51.600> when<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> race<00:03:52.080> no<00:03:52.290> one<00:03:52.440> would

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
necessarily when the race no one would

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.210 
necessarily when the race no one would
expect<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.470> idea<00:03:55.800> is<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.010> get<00:03:56.100> as

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
expect that but the idea is to get as

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.180 
expect that but the idea is to get as
many<00:03:56.400> points<00:03:56.640> at<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.090> end<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.510> day

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
many points at the end of the day

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.150 
many points at the end of the day
exactly<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:01.110> obviously<00:04:01.440> gonna<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.680> sort<00:04:02.070> of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
exactly it's obviously gonna be sort of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.830 
exactly it's obviously gonna be sort of
difficult<00:04:02.400> to

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.220 

from<00:04:05.170> today<00:04:05.290> with<00:04:05.590> yeah

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
from today with yeah

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.649 
from today with yeah
to<00:04:07.800> score<00:04:08.040> as<00:04:08.220> many<00:04:08.250> points<00:04:08.489> as<00:04:08.790> possible<00:04:09.030> and

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
to score as many points as possible and

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.869

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
very very close and that's that could be

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.290 
very very close and that's that could be
too<00:05:17.440> late<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.280> yeah<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.520> don't<00:05:18.760> see<00:05:18.910> anything

too late so yeah you don't see anything
at<00:05:19.570> all<00:05:19.600> that's<00:05:20.020> as<00:05:20.140> simple<00:05:20.290> as<00:05:20.590> that<00:05:21.090> why<00:05:22.090> we

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
at all that's as simple as that why we

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.900 
at all that's as simple as that why we
are<00:05:22.480> looking<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.140> a<00:05:23.350> rolling<00:05:23.860> start<00:05:24.160> at<00:05:24.670> the
