00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
101 a which is the hardness of the wheel

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.390 
101 a which is the hardness of the wheel
in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> scale<00:00:18.199> they<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.380> cool<00:00:19.770> 13th

and<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> cool<00:00:25.019> swirl<00:00:25.380> design<00:00:27.109> this

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and they have a cool swirl design this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.019 
and they have a cool swirl design this
one<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.560> all-black<00:00:29.099> most<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
one is just all-black most it was just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.510 
one is just all-black most it was just
black<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.830> they<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> different

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
black but they all have a different

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.310 
black but they all have a different
design<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.329> each<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> us<00:00:33.840> not<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
design on each one of us not all the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.500 
design on each one of us not all the
same<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:35.899> cool<00:00:37.489> not<00:00:38.489> all<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> same

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.830 

alright<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.550> these<00:00:44.550> wheels<00:00:44.879> we're<00:00:45.450> pretty

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
alright so these wheels we're pretty

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709 
alright so these wheels we're pretty
good<00:00:46.110> I'd<00:00:46.710> say<00:00:46.940> they<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.270> any<00:00:48.450> like

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
good I'd say they don't have any like

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
good I'd say they don't have any like
super<00:00:49.110> tech<00:00:49.320> formula<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.550> their<00:00:50.640> urethane

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
super tech formula for their urethane

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.189 
super tech formula for their urethane
like<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.410> fire<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.160> bones<00:00:53.640> house<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.270> even<00:00:54.329> rikta

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
like a fire or bones house or even rikta

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
like a fire or bones house or even rikta
they<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> same<00:00:56.789> type<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:58.399> urethane

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
they just use the same type of urethane

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.110 
they just use the same type of urethane
and<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> wheels<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.329> guess<00:01:01.609> but<00:01:02.609> these

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and all the wheels I guess but these

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.170 
and all the wheels I guess but these
wheels<00:01:03.329> were<00:01:03.600> good<00:01:04.430> they<00:01:05.430> feel<00:01:05.760> good<00:01:05.970> they

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
wheels were good they feel good they

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
wheels were good they feel good they
slide<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> only<00:01:08.939> thing<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
slide pretty good the only thing I have

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
slide pretty good the only thing I have
to<00:01:09.330> say<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.960> wear<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.950> quick

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to say is they do wear down a bit quick

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.649 
to say is they do wear down a bit quick
in<00:01:12.210> terms<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.869> size<00:01:13.880> because<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.240> only<00:01:15.420> been

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
in terms of size because I've only been

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
in terms of size because I've only been
skiing<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:16.049> for<00:01:16.259> 4<00:01:16.439> months<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
skiing these for 4 months and I can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.300 
skiing these for 4 months and I can
already<00:01:17.220> fit<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.610> whole<00:01:17.729> hand<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.299> them<00:01:22.310> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
already fit my whole hand around them so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
already fit my whole hand around them so
that's<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.759> thing<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:26.299> retail<00:01:27.299> price<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that's the only thing and retail price I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.700 
that's the only thing and retail price I
believe<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:29.869> $32<00:01:31.100> which<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.579> pricey

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
believe was $32 which was a bit pricey

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.600 
believe was $32 which was a bit pricey
but<00:01:35.450> these<00:01:36.450> wheels<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:37.020> made<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.530> USA<00:01:38.070> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but these wheels are made in the USA so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
but these wheels are made in the USA so
it's<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.979> plus<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.610> for<00:01:42.450> being<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's kind of a plus to that for being so

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.850 
it's kind of a plus to that for being so
expensive<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.049> nothing<00:01:46.770> at

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
expensive if you don't really nothing at

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
expensive if you don't really nothing at
all<00:01:46.950> weird<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.850> type<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> stuff<00:01:48.299> but

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
all weird about that type of stuff but

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
all weird about that type of stuff but
if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> even<00:01:49.320> care<00:01:49.700> just<00:01:50.700> letting<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.090> know

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
if you even care just letting you know

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.520 
if you even care just letting you know
they<00:01:51.390> aren't<00:01:51.600> made<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.750> America<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
they aren't made in America so it's a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.620 
they aren't made in America so it's a
keeping<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:59.270> what<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> found<00:02:00.570> very

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
keeping it here what I found very

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.359 
keeping it here what I found very
impressive<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.500> wheels<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.040> how<00:02:02.250> long

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
impressive with these wheels is how long

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.990 
impressive with these wheels is how long
the<00:02:02.549> graphic<00:02:03.000> lasted<00:02:04.399> I've<00:02:05.399> never<00:02:05.759> had<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the graphic lasted I've never had a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
the graphic lasted I've never had a
wheel<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> graphic<00:02:07.860> didn't<00:02:08.160> wasn't

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
wheel that the graphic didn't wasn't

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.050 
wheel that the graphic didn't wasn't
burned<00:02:08.759> off<00:02:09.050> burned<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.170> after<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> week

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
burned off burned off after like a week

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.590 
burned off burned off after like a week
which<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.180> pretty<00:02:12.209> impressive

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
which is pretty impressive

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.990 
which is pretty impressive
look<00:02:14.320> at<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:15.360> Spitfire<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:17.410> God<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.790> one

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
look at this Spitfire it's God this one

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.090 
look at this Spitfire it's God this one
still<00:02:19.240> just<00:02:19.420> has<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.750> all<00:02:19.840> around

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.640 

yeah<00:02:24.100> these<00:02:24.340> wheels<00:02:24.610> feel<00:02:25.420> pretty<00:02:25.870> good<00:02:26.050> dark

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
yeah these wheels feel pretty good dark

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.230 
yeah these wheels feel pretty good dark
see<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> harder<00:02:27.190> wheel<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:30.000> they're<00:02:31.000> meant<00:02:31.210> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
see a harder wheel so they're meant to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.740 
see a harder wheel so they're meant to
be<00:02:32.280> ridden<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.520> an<00:02:33.730> all-terrain<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:34.420> guess

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
be ridden on an all-terrain I guess

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
be ridden on an all-terrain I guess
meant<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.710> for<00:02:35.890> more<00:02:36.070> speed<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:38.610> did<00:02:39.610> get<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
meant to that for more speed I did get a

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.200 
meant to that for more speed I did get a
flat<00:02:40.090> spot<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.420> one<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.830> don't<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.910> if<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> can

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
flat spot on one I don't know if you can

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.180 
flat spot on one I don't know if you can
really<00:02:43.420> see<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:46.740> it's<00:02:47.740> right<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:48.100> at

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
really see it but it's right there at

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.640 
really see it but it's right there at
the<00:02:48.340> top<00:02:48.810> at<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.990> top<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.350> don't<00:02:50.470> know<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.590> you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the top at the top I don't know if you

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.470 
the top at the top I don't know if you
can<00:02:50.770> really<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:54.180> did<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.270> one

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
can really see it but I did get one

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.000 
can really see it but I did get one
little<00:02:55.720> flat<00:02:55.900> spot<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.590> wasn't<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> big

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
little flat spot but it wasn't a big

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
little flat spot but it wasn't a big
deal<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:57.460> have<00:02:58.330> an<00:02:58.510> effective<00:02:59.200> anything<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
deal I have an effective anything the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.560 
deal I have an effective anything the
wheels<00:03:01.300> also<00:03:01.540> kind<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.020> chip<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> little<00:03:02.590> bit<00:03:03.570> it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
wheels also kind of chip a little bit it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:15.110 
wheels also kind of chip a little bit it
cracks<00:03:04.930> from<00:03:05.200> like<00:03:05.410> rocks<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:13.000> has<00:03:13.150> like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
cracks from like rocks this one has like

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.170 
cracks from like rocks this one has like
top<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:17.470> little<00:03:17.710> chips<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.850> doesn't<00:03:19.060> really

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
top just little chips it doesn't really

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.780 
top just little chips it doesn't really
do<00:03:19.360> anything<00:03:19.570> but<00:03:19.870> just<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
do anything but just so you know and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.250 
do anything but just so you know and
then<00:03:21.990> when<00:03:22.990> I<00:03:23.080> got<00:03:23.320> these<00:03:23.500> like<00:03:25.020> inside<00:03:26.020> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
then when I got these like inside the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.870 
then when I got these like inside the
core<00:03:26.800> of<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.130> wheel<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.460> kind<00:03:27.670> of<00:03:27.730> had<00:03:27.850> like

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
core of the wheel it kind of had like

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.120 
core of the wheel it kind of had like
the<00:03:28.450> urethane<00:03:28.780> mold<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.410> like<00:03:29.710> extra

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
the urethane mold on it like extra

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.360 
the urethane mold on it like extra
pieces<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.820> kind<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.090> had<00:03:31.240> to<00:03:31.270> rip<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.600> off

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
pieces so I kind of had to rip it off

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.710 
pieces so I kind of had to rip it off
but<00:03:34.710> overall<00:03:35.710> these<00:03:36.100> wheels<00:03:36.430> were<00:03:36.820> good<00:03:37.270> you

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
but overall these wheels were good you

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.200 
but overall these wheels were good you
know<00:03:38.250> they<00:03:39.250> weren't<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.610> best<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.090> they

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
know they weren't the best but they

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.310 
know they weren't the best but they
weren't<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.540> worst<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.930> know<00:03:41.020> they're<00:03:41.170> just

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
weren't the worst you know they're just

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.900 
weren't the worst you know they're just
good<00:03:41.560> there's<00:03:41.830> just<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.070> solid<00:03:42.610> wheel<00:03:44.520> if<00:03:45.520> you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
good there's just a solid wheel if you

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.280 
good there's just a solid wheel if you
were<00:03:46.000> thinking<00:03:46.330> about<00:03:46.390> getting<00:03:46.780> him<00:03:47.050> I<00:03:47.170> would

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
were thinking about getting him I would

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.380 
were thinking about getting him I would
say<00:03:47.440> go<00:03:47.620> ahead<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.950> try<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.190> they<00:03:48.730> are<00:03:48.850> good<00:03:49.120> I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
say go ahead and try it they are good I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.360 
say go ahead and try it they are good I
would<00:03:49.840> definitely<00:03:50.140> get<00:03:50.230> another<00:03:50.440> pair<00:03:50.800> just

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
would definitely get another pair just

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.900 
would definitely get another pair just
cuz<00:03:51.550> they<00:03:51.760> I'm<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.810> really<00:03:53.050> sick<00:03:53.290> team<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
cuz they I'm a really sick team and the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.640 
cuz they I'm a really sick team and the
wheels<00:03:55.330> always<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.780> cool<00:03:55.960> graphics<00:03:56.380> and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
wheels always have cool graphics and

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.540 
wheels always have cool graphics and
they're<00:03:56.740> just<00:03:56.860> good<00:03:57.430> wheels<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:59.620> plus<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.490> I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
they're just good wheels one plus that I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.970 
they're just good wheels one plus that I
always<00:04:00.700> like<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.780> packaging<00:04:02.590> came<00:04:02.830> with

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
always like is the packaging came with

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.040 
always like is the packaging came with
the<00:04:03.070> sticker<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:04.240> that<00:04:04.390> was<00:04:04.480> cool<00:04:04.690> but<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:07.690> yeah

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
the sticker so that was cool but a yeah

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.960 
the sticker so that was cool but a yeah
overall<00:04:08.530> these<00:04:08.740> peoples<00:04:09.010> were<00:04:09.220> solid<00:04:09.790> I

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
overall these peoples were solid I

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.330 
overall these peoples were solid I
definitely<00:04:10.720> give<00:04:10.810> them<00:04:10.870> like<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.940> 8<00:04:12.940> out<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.210> 10

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
definitely give them like a 8 out of 10

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.630 
definitely give them like a 8 out of 10
but<00:04:15.340> uh<00:04:16.500> but<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.590> think<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.859> thought<00:04:18.070> bad<00:04:18.520> about

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
but uh but I think I thought bad about

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.640 
but uh but I think I thought bad about
them<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.180> that<00:04:19.210> they<00:04:19.500> wore<00:04:20.500> out<00:04:20.910> kind<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:21.970> fast

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
them was that they wore out kind of fast

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.110 
them was that they wore out kind of fast
because<00:04:23.650> usually<00:04:23.800> ice<00:04:24.190> skate<00:04:24.520> wheels<00:04:24.790> for

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
because usually ice skate wheels for

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.210 
because usually ice skate wheels for
like<00:04:25.270> six<00:04:26.050> months<00:04:26.470> or<00:04:26.590> something

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
like six months or something

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.430 
like six months or something
and<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.240> so<00:04:28.480> far<00:04:28.690> I've<00:04:28.780> only<00:04:28.870> skinny<00:04:29.260> these

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and that so far I've only skinny these

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.270 
and that so far I've only skinny these
for<00:04:29.650> about<00:04:29.740> four<00:04:33.000> but<00:04:34.000> um<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:35.280> overall

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
for about four but um just overall

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.680 
for about four but um just overall
review<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.840> good<00:04:38.170> wheel<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.330> definitely

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
review it's a good wheel so I definitely

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.430 
review it's a good wheel so I definitely
say<00:04:41.020> go<00:04:41.050> try<00:04:41.440> if<00:04:41.650> you're<00:04:41.770> thinking<00:04:42.100> about<00:04:42.160> it
