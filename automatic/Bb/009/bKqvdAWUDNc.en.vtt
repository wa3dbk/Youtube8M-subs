00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
thing that caught my eye was basically

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.230 
thing that caught my eye was basically
how<00:03:04.230> in-depth<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.890> was<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> got

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
how in-depth it was because when I got

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.260 
how in-depth it was because when I got
into<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.960> was<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.950> overwhelming<00:03:08.520> how

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
into it it was just overwhelming how

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.820 
into it it was just overwhelming how
much<00:03:09.480> information<00:03:09.780> was<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.320> front<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.620> your

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
much information was in front of your

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.790 
much information was in front of your
face<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.270> felt<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.270> right<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.600> was<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.650> oh

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
face but it felt so right it was like oh

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.199 
face but it felt so right it was like oh
it<00:03:17.370> was<00:03:17.610> absolutely<00:03:18.450> brilliant<00:03:19.790> where<00:03:20.790> do

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
it was absolutely brilliant where do

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.670 
it was absolutely brilliant where do
with<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.989> have<00:03:22.080> compared<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
with it this would have compared to a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.380 
with it this would have compared to a
you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> man<00:03:24.200> style<00:03:25.200> or<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:26.390> basketball

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
you know a man style or a basketball

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.960 
you know a man style or a basketball
style<00:03:27.630> or<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.110> mean<00:03:28.860> big<00:03:29.310> ant<00:03:29.489> studios<00:03:29.520> is

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
style or I mean big ant studios is

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.080 
style or I mean big ant studios is
obviously<00:03:30.480> much<00:03:30.630> smaller<00:03:31.020> than<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.290> 2k<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.580> TA

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
obviously much smaller than a 2k or a TA

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.720 
obviously much smaller than a 2k or a TA
you<00:03:33.540> think<00:03:33.810> I'm<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:35.190> up<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.489> that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
you think I'm it it's up to that

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.000 
you think I'm it it's up to that
standard<00:03:35.910> or<00:03:36.390> do<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:36.750> think<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:37.110> really

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
standard or do you think it's really

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.100 
standard or do you think it's really
really<00:03:38.250> good<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:38.670> they<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:38.850> do<00:03:39.060> oh<00:03:39.270> I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
really good for what they can do oh I

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.330 
really good for what they can do oh I
definitely<00:03:40.470> think<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.190> that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
definitely think it's up to that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
definitely think it's up to that
standard<00:03:41.520> things<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.390> they<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.630> done<00:03:42.660> it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
standard things that they have done it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.670 
standard things that they have done it
just<00:03:43.739> absolutely<00:03:44.340> brilliant<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.530> yeah<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just absolutely brilliant and yeah the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680 
just absolutely brilliant and yeah the
customization<00:03:47.550> when<00:03:47.730> heading<00:03:48.300> into<00:03:48.450> that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
customization when heading into that

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.030 
customization when heading into that
mode<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.260> pretty<00:03:49.890> good<00:03:51.470> that's<00:03:52.470> that's<00:03:52.980> great

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
rugby 15 and it's much better than rugby
