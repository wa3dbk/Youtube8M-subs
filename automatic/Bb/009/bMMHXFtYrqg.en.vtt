00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello to all the boys I know nothing 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.460
 million today we are here on the co2 in the 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.309
 zombie mode on the map mob of the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.480
 dead and in this video I'll show you 

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:33.649
 how to find the pieces to build 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.360
 practically the push push gives us the 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.190
 push c.da that is considered of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.880
 upgrade the new shotgun a 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.710
 four rods the pieces to take are 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.720
 three the first piece is found here 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.040
 precisely here on the ground but not now 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.420
 you see why I'm recording in 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.280
 cinema mode has seen that to do 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.110
 the kit was not built to build 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 portray from the x men and this is the view 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.989
 the first kit I was seen by him 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.960
 saying it is here on the ground you can't see it 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.129
 because I'm in cinema mode for oil 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.750
 heat is not always the same 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.929
 in fact this cost is here or here 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.719
 here earth or near always 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:19.249
 prisons so look for little on the ground or 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:21.829
 near the cells we find 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:24.830
 see the case the x men learned now the 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.540
 flashing piece 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.920
 now make the video and I'll show you 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.720
 where is the second piece well the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.580
 second piece is found here 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.900
 in the infirmary precisely on this 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.920
 coffee table and here I got the piece 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.960
 flashing this is the visual view 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.320
 from me it's the piece I took it in 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.820
 particular the piece can be found or on 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.570
 that little table that I now make you 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.880
 review I revise 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.290
 now you can't see on this table 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.010
 because precisely on the cinema mode 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:06.810
 or you can find it near where 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.580
 I will show you the cash register now 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.730
 precisely here in this corner 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.230
 here or if not found here in 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.510
 nearby, always checked nearby 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.450
 infirmary anyway now there 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.730
 we keep in which the cut again 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.780
 video to show the third piece where 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:31.830
 we find ourselves here with the last one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.730
 third piece found 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.440
 near where there is speed with a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.990
 now I'll show you and it's there on the ground 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.990
 near the fireplace here now I take it 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.450
 and here are all three pieces now 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.590
 I'll show you the other position too 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.150
 of this piece 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.850
 then the straight ones where the firm now 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.350
 or here is earth here 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.960
 here is where this pile of 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.540
 de ski in this corner 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.180
 if you were not to be found here if not yes 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.420
 even here is always found in the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:12.420
 near the speed exit once taken 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.959
 all three pieces we have to give back 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 up at a wall bar for note 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.570
 assemble the pieces of over preference me 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.570
 I went to the workbench 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:33.260
 who is it is called where there is any 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.360
 I am in the infirmary here 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.620
 arrived here and built the pieces one 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.010
 once pieces costs however it is not yet 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.340
 finished because with this kit you can 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.810
 upgrade the rifle to the new rifle a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.170
 four rods so we'll have to get ourselves 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:58.070
 the four-barreled gun and me 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.920
 I am procured by making myself a box is 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:05.690
 absolutely cool than before 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.840
 tax was the rifle 4 exit 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.840
 years 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.920
 now I'll show you I'm going to do 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.720
 the case that is in fact was in the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.110
 speed room cola 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.870
 I'll make the cash and see how it succeeds 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:34.980
 the four-barreled wall gun 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:35.580
 now back to the workbench mi 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.840
 I was saying 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.840
 back to the workbench 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.599
 and put the weapon in the thing for 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.039
 boost it will take 22 seconds to 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:52.800
 upgrade it and here it is we take is a 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:56.129
 lieutenant and we get the shit like it 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.310
 he calls but the push is not me 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.310
 I remember 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.480
 because he wonders why he is married 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.700
 he said but beautiful does nothing and we will get 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.040
 this new and in particular this weapon 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.140
 sure in turn still modify the 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.490
 pack a punch and will be practically one 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.100
