00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
the past where I've just seen something

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490 
the past where I've just seen something
in<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.430> magazine<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.030> liked<00:03:33.299> or<00:03:33.599> I'll<00:03:34.260> see

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
in a magazine that I liked or I'll see

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.899 
in a magazine that I liked or I'll see
something<00:03:34.739> on<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:34.980> sale<00:03:35.280> rack<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.579> looks

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
something on the sale rack that looks

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.550 
something on the sale rack that looks
kind<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.209> interesting<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.930> different<00:03:37.349> and

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
kind of interesting and different and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.619 
kind of interesting and different and
I'll<00:03:37.980> buy<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.639> then<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.790> bring<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> home<00:03:39.359> and

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
I'll buy it and then I bring it home and

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.360 
I'll buy it and then I bring it home and
there's<00:03:39.780> absolutely<00:03:40.409> nothing<00:03:40.949> that<00:03:41.129> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
there's absolutely nothing that it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.789 
there's absolutely nothing that it
matches<00:03:41.579> with<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:42.870> I'm<00:03:43.109> either<00:03:43.290> forced

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
matches with and then I'm either forced

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.339 
matches with and then I'm either forced
to<00:03:43.919> go<00:03:44.040> buy<00:03:44.190> other<00:03:44.430> things<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:44.879> match<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.299> or<00:03:45.479> it

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
to go buy other things to match it or it

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.680 
to go buy other things to match it or it
goes<00:03:46.650> unworn<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.430> unused<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.120> just<00:03:48.269> stays<00:03:48.510> in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
goes unworn and unused and just stays in

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.770 
goes unworn and unused and just stays in
my<00:03:48.810> closet<00:03:49.199> with<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.440> tags<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.280> I<00:03:51.180> just

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
my closet with the tags on and I just

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.250 
my closet with the tags on and I just
find<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.319> very<00:03:52.500> wasteful<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.260> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
find that this is very wasteful and the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.830 
find that this is very wasteful and the
reason<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:55.889> find<00:03:56.220> capsule<00:03:56.760> wardrobe<00:03:57.150> fits

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
reason that I find capsule wardrobe fits

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.050 
reason that I find capsule wardrobe fits
in<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.349> well<00:03:58.379> with<00:03:58.560> minimalism<00:03:59.129> is<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.940> it

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
in so well with minimalism is that it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.110 
in so well with minimalism is that it
focuses<00:04:00.569> on<00:04:00.720> actual<00:04:01.260> uses<00:04:02.069> per<00:04:02.370> where<00:04:02.699> you're

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
focuses on actual uses per where you're

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.270 
focuses on actual uses per where you're
having<00:04:03.449> less<00:04:03.720> items<00:04:04.169> in<00:04:04.319> your<00:04:04.440> closet<00:04:04.889> but

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
having less items in your closet but

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.979 
having less items in your closet but
you're<00:04:05.459> really<00:04:05.819> getting<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.150> value<00:04:06.659> out<00:04:06.690> of

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
you're really getting the value out of

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.740 
you're really getting the value out of
them<00:04:07.169> because<00:04:07.639> you've<00:04:08.639> planned<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:09.329> know<00:04:09.359> 10

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
them because you've planned you know 10

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.110 
them because you've planned you know 10
outfits<00:04:10.169> that<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.680> same<00:04:10.979> piece<00:04:11.310> can<00:04:11.639> work<00:04:11.849> in

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
outfits that the same piece can work in

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.780 
outfits that the same piece can work in
and<00:04:12.449> you're<00:04:12.569> actually<00:04:13.280> getting<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> most<00:04:14.579> out

of the money that you spend and just the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.649 
of the money that you spend and just the
time<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.669> put<00:04:17.699> into<00:04:17.940> shopping<00:04:18.359> is

time that you put into shopping is

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.240 
time that you put into shopping is
actually<00:04:19.169> worth<00:04:19.409> it<00:04:19.620> because<00:04:19.859> you're<00:04:20.039> buying

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
and that's my next point I kind of

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.470 
and that's my next point I kind of
already<00:04:25.320> said<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:25.740> less

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
already said it but less

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.020 
already said it but less
overall<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.470> better<00:04:27.740> quality<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.520> more

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
overall and better quality and more

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.330 
overall and better quality and more
where's<00:04:29.330> per<00:04:29.600> by<00:04:29.780> per<00:04:30.320> buy<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.980> getting<00:04:31.250> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
where's per by per buy so getting the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.100 
where's per by per buy so getting the
most<00:04:31.520> out<00:04:31.730> of<00:04:31.760> your<00:04:31.880> money<00:04:32.090> yeah<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.810> think

that's a huge one a lot of us just go on

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.840 
that's a huge one a lot of us just go on
impulse<00:04:35.420> and<00:04:35.720> buy<00:04:36.590> these<00:04:36.650> things<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.460> if

but you only use it twice you've spent
$10<00:04:42.410> per<00:04:42.890> wear<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:43.430> item<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.480> some

$10 per wear of that item and in some

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.360 
$10 per wear of that item and in some
cases<00:04:44.930> we<00:04:45.230> buy<00:04:45.380> things<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:45.710> we<00:04:45.890> never<00:04:46.070> wear

at all and you just throw in twenty
dollars<00:04:48.740> down<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:48.980> drain

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
dollars down the drain

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.360 
dollars down the drain
