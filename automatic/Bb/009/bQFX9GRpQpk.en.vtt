Steve Neville alarm works this is the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.660 
Steve Neville alarm works this is the
new<00:00:05.190> one<00:00:05.370> for<00:00:05.930> 2012<00:00:06.930> which<00:00:07.170> has<00:00:07.379> got<00:00:07.670> built-in

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
new one for 2012 which has got built-in

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.330 
new one for 2012 which has got built-in
sensitivity<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.599> volume<00:00:09.960> adjustment<00:00:10.559> it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
sensitivity and volume adjustment it's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240 
sensitivity and volume adjustment it's
got<00:00:11.550> two<00:00:12.090> sensitivity<00:00:12.780> settings<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:14.040> which

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
got two sensitivity settings one which

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.580 
got two sensitivity settings one which
is<00:00:14.429> normal<00:00:14.820> exactly<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> same<00:00:16.109> as<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> normal

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
is normal exactly the same as a normal

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.970 
is normal exactly the same as a normal
Neville<00:00:17.279> alarm<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.660> other<00:00:18.810> setting<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Neville alarm and the other setting is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.779 
Neville alarm and the other setting is
low<00:00:20.400> sensitivity<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.890> if<00:00:22.890> you've<00:00:23.220> got<00:00:23.430> drift

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
low sensitivity so if you've got drift

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.740 
low sensitivity so if you've got drift
or<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> windy<00:00:25.439> day<00:00:26.449> you're<00:00:27.449> not<00:00:27.570> going

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
or if it's a windy day you're not going

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
or if it's a windy day you're not going
to<00:00:27.840> pick<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.320> load<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.650> false<00:00:29.010> alarms<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
to pick up a load of false alarms and it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
to pick up a load of false alarms and it
should<00:00:30.210> cut<00:00:30.390> them<00:00:30.539> down<00:00:30.740> almost<00:00:31.740> completely

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
should cut them down almost completely

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.990 
should cut them down almost completely
even<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> very<00:00:33.030> windy<00:00:33.540> day<00:00:34.430> you've<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.610> got

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
even on a very windy day you've also got

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.100 
even on a very windy day you've also got
three<00:00:36.180> levels<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.899> volume<00:00:37.320> high<00:00:37.680> low<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
three levels of volume high low and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
three levels of volume high low and
silent<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.739> one's<00:00:40.980> got<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> built-in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
silent and this one's got the built-in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
silent and this one's got the built-in
radio<00:00:42.239> transmitter<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
radio transmitter so it's one of the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.310 
radio transmitter so it's one of the
small<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.420> I'll<00:00:45.510> switch<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
small back off so I'll switch it on and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
small back off so I'll switch it on and
you'll<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.739> happens<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:48.000> latching<00:00:48.750> LED

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you'll see what happens the latching LED

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220 
you'll see what happens the latching LED
flashes<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> goes<00:00:50.309> solid<00:00:51.110> then<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
flashes and then it goes solid then it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
flashes and then it goes solid then it
just<00:00:52.410> switches<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.879> low<00:00:54.059> beep<00:00:54.329> means

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
just switches on and that low beep means

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.889 
just switches on and that low beep means
that<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> sensitivity<00:00:55.469> set<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.250> low<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that the sensitivity set to low so if I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
that the sensitivity set to low so if I
turn<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> wheel<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:59.180> try<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
turn the wheel just try and get the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
turn the wheel just try and get the
light<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> sings<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> better<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
light on it sings see it better if I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.200 
light on it sings see it better if I
turn<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> wheel<00:01:02.910> slowly<00:01:04.100> nothing<00:01:05.100> happens<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
turn the wheel slowly nothing happens so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
turn the wheel slowly nothing happens so
if<00:01:06.330> you've<00:01:06.450> got<00:01:06.770> bit<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> drift<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> line

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
if you've got bit of drift on the line

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.600 
if you've got bit of drift on the line
overnight<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> keep<00:01:10.610> setting

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
overnight it's not going to keep setting

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
overnight it's not going to keep setting
the<00:01:11.700> alarm<00:01:11.820> off<00:01:12.150> soon<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> normal

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the alarm off soon as you get a normal

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.700 
the alarm off soon as you get a normal
bike<00:01:13.439> picks<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.549> again<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.540> wakes<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
bike picks it up again it wakes up and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.609 
bike picks it up again it wakes up and
it<00:01:16.830> goes<00:01:16.950> solid<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it goes solid like it would and if if it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.850 
it goes solid like it would and if if it
goes<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:20.189> now<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.530> stopped<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
goes again now now that it's stopped you

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
goes again now now that it's stopped you
get<00:01:23.040> nothing<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> fast<00:01:24.420> run<00:01:24.689> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
get nothing if you get a fast run just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
get nothing if you get a fast run just
switches<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> normal<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.150> bit

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
switches on like normal but a little bit

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.620 
switches on like normal but a little bit
of<00:01:27.390> drift<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.140> nothing<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.420> that's<00:01:30.420> how

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
of drift you get nothing so that's how

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.980 
of drift you get nothing so that's how
it<00:01:30.780> sets<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.650> low<00:01:32.250> sensitivity<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> can

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it sets in low sensitivity so you can

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
it sets in low sensitivity so you can
see<00:01:34.140> that'll<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> again<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.790> goes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
see that'll do it again it goes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
see that'll do it again it goes
perfectly<00:01:36.840> normal<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> normal<00:01:37.560> run<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.850> if

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
perfectly normal on a normal run but if

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
perfectly normal on a normal run but if
it<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.840> moves<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:40.590> because

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it just just moves a little bit because

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.429 
it just just moves a little bit because
of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> wind<00:01:41.700> older<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> drift<00:01:43.229> or

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of the wind older or the drift or

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679 
of the wind older or the drift or
anything<00:01:43.740> else<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.670> you've<00:01:45.060> got<00:01:45.450> tight

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
anything else because you've got tight

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.249 
anything else because you've got tight
lines<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.700> slack<00:01:47.700> lines<00:01:48.049> there<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.140> go

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
lines and slack lines there you go

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.210 
lines and slack lines there you go
nothing<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.649> soon<00:01:52.649> as<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> run

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
nothing and they soon as you get a run

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
nothing and they soon as you get a run
does<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.079> absolutely

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
does it so that that and that absolutely

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
does it so that that and that absolutely
works<00:01:55.860> brilliantly<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:58.170> set<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.740> what

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
works brilliantly and to set that what

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
works brilliantly and to set that what
happens<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> switch<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.049> light

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
happens is you switch on the light

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.219 
happens is you switch on the light
flashes<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.969> goes<00:02:03.119> solid<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:04.110> you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
flashes and then it goes solid if you

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.020 
flashes and then it goes solid if you
want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.979> toggle<00:02:05.250> between<00:02:05.549> normal

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
want to toggle between normal

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359 
want to toggle between normal
sensitivity<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.079> low<00:02:07.290> sensitivity<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:08.220> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
sensitivity and low sensitivity then you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.309 
sensitivity and low sensitivity then you
just<00:02:08.580> switch<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> off<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.750> lights<00:02:09.959> solid

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
just switch it off when the lights solid

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.309 
just switch it off when the lights solid
so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.920> switch<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.050> light<00:02:13.050> goes<00:02:13.290> solid

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
so I do that switch on light goes solid

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.030 
so I do that switch on light goes solid
switch

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
switch

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.250 
switch
now<00:02:14.879> next<00:02:15.120> time<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.510> switch<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> will<00:02:16.200> have

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
now next time you switch on it will have

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.190 
now next time you switch on it will have
toggled<00:02:16.709> between<00:02:16.860> high<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.400> low<00:02:17.610> sensitivity

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
toggled between high and low sensitivity

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.490 
toggled between high and low sensitivity
so<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:20.030> I'll<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.209> set<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.629> normal<00:02:22.379> high

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
so now I'll be set to normal high

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.729 
so now I'll be set to normal high
sensitivity<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.849> can<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.269> I<00:02:24.590> turn<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
sensitivity and you can see I turn the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.399 
sensitivity and you can see I turn the
wheel<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.489> just<00:02:26.760> goes<00:02:26.909> on<00:02:27.090> every<00:02:27.390> on<00:02:27.930> every<00:02:28.170> air

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
wheel it just goes on every on every air

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.270 
wheel it just goes on every on every air
detection<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> could<00:02:30.989> like<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> normal<00:02:31.950> level

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
detection so I could like a normal level

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.690 
detection so I could like a normal level
alarm<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.810> always<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.230> done<00:02:34.579> so<00:02:35.579> it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
alarm as they always have done so it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.160 
alarm as they always have done so it
makes<00:02:35.909> no<00:02:36.000> difference<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> want<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.019> fish

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
makes no difference if you want to fish

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.899 
makes no difference if you want to fish
normally<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:38.069> do<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.340> next<00:02:38.579> time<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
normally just do that next time you

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.569 
normally just do that next time you
switch<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:39.360> it'll<00:02:40.019> still<00:02:40.470> remembered<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
switch it on it'll still remembered that

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.720 
switch it on it'll still remembered that
setting<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.420> it's<00:02:42.840> back<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.079> normal<00:02:43.260> again

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
setting so it's back to normal again

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.330 
setting so it's back to normal again
then<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.790> know<00:02:44.879> just<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> same<00:02:45.510> on<00:02:46.340> every

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
then you know just the same on every

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.599 
then you know just the same on every
every<00:02:48.239> time<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.750> wheel<00:02:48.900> moves<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.890> detectives

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
every time the wheel moves it detectives

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.460 
every time the wheel moves it detectives
if<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.540> want<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.810> go<00:02:51.900> back<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.319> low

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
if you want to go back to low

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.640 
if you want to go back to low
sensitivity<00:02:53.359> just<00:02:54.359> switch<00:02:54.569> off<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.049> it's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
sensitivity just switch off when it's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.099 
sensitivity just switch off when it's
solid<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.909> switch<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.510> there's<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> beep

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
solid and switch on and there's the beep

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.080 
solid and switch on and there's the beep
a<00:03:01.409> low<00:03:01.680> pitch<00:03:01.889> beep<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.400> tell<00:03:02.579> you<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.849> set<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
a low pitch beep to tell you it's set to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.860 
a low pitch beep to tell you it's set to
low<00:03:03.359> sensitivity<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.849> think<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:05.909> won't<00:03:06.690> do

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
low sensitivity I think I won't do

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.349 
low sensitivity I think I won't do
anything<00:03:07.700> until<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> get<00:03:08.909> a<00:03:08.970> decent<00:03:09.420> run<00:03:10.310> and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
anything until you get a decent run and

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.360 
anything until you get a decent run and
this<00:03:12.359> has<00:03:12.480> been<00:03:12.690> tested<00:03:13.139> for<00:03:13.470> ages<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.250> get

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
this has been tested for ages to get

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.990 
this has been tested for ages to get
just<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> right<00:03:14.819> timing<00:03:15.269> on<00:03:15.510> there<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:17.849> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
just the right timing on there and that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.030 
just the right timing on there and that
goes<00:03:18.209> perfect<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.669> works<00:03:21.299> beautifully

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
goes perfect and that works beautifully

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.009 
goes perfect and that works beautifully
the<00:03:23.040> only<00:03:23.370> other<00:03:23.459> thing<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.849> show<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the only other thing to show is the

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.110 
the only other thing to show is the
volume<00:03:25.349> adjustment<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:26.459> when<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.730> switch<00:03:26.970> on

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
volume adjustment so when you switch on

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240 
volume adjustment so when you switch on
you'll<00:03:27.389> notice<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.959> light<00:03:28.139> flashes<00:03:28.680> then<00:03:29.129> it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you'll notice the light flashes then it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.180 
you'll notice the light flashes then it
goes<00:03:29.400> solid<00:03:30.169> and<00:03:31.169> then<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> two<00:03:31.590> switches<00:03:31.859> on

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
goes solid and then it two switches on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.599 
goes solid and then it two switches on
if<00:03:32.699> you<00:03:32.910> switch<00:03:33.180> off<00:03:33.329> when<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:33.690> flashing

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
if you switch off when it's flashing

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.610 
if you switch off when it's flashing
next<00:03:35.609> time<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.910> switch<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.329> you're<00:03:37.199> in<00:03:37.319> volume

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
next time you switch on you're in volume

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.509 
next time you switch on you're in volume
adjustments<00:03:38.129> are<00:03:38.250> high<00:03:38.400> low<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.239> silent<00:03:39.720> high

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
adjustments are high low and silent high

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.400 
adjustments are high low and silent high
low<00:03:41.519> silent<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.419> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.660> leave<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.959> with<00:03:42.989> you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
low silent and you can leave it with you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.860 
low silent and you can leave it with you
doing<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.250> until<00:03:44.489> you're<00:03:44.639> ready<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:45.780> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
doing that until you're ready so if you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.629 
doing that until you're ready so if you
want<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.079> set<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> light<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.010> switch<00:03:47.489> it

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
want to set it to light just switch it

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.009 
want to set it to light just switch it
off<00:03:47.730> when<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:48.030> high<00:03:48.209> next<00:03:48.629> time<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.840> switch

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
off when it's high next time you switch

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.379 
off when it's high next time you switch
on<00:03:52.069> switched<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.519> volume<00:03:53.849> set<00:03:54.090> to

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
on switched on now the volume set to

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.830 
on switched on now the volume set to
high<00:03:55.519> if<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.579> want<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:57.000> silent<00:03:57.449> you<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.720> do

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
high if you want it silent you can do

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.110 
high if you want it silent you can do
that<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.139> this<00:03:58.199> is<00:03:58.340> yeah<00:03:59.340> works<00:03:59.699> really<00:03:59.940> well

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
that and this is yeah works really well

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.330 
that and this is yeah works really well
if<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.079> want<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.409> set<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.769> silent<00:04:01.949> just

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
if you want to set it to silent just

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.559 
if you want to set it to silent just
switch<00:04:02.549> off<00:04:02.699> when<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.090> flashing

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
switch off when it's flashing

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.939 
switch off when it's flashing
highs<00:04:04.349> low<00:04:05.449> silent<00:04:06.449> and<00:04:07.349> there<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.590> go
