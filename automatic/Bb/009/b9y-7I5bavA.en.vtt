00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
think it reduces frizz by not like

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.989 
think it reduces frizz by not like
putting<00:06:10.650> my<00:06:10.710> hair<00:06:10.860> up<00:06:11.009> and<00:06:11.339> then<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:11.729> kind<00:06:11.939> of

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:11.999 
putting my hair up and then it kind of

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.450 
putting my hair up and then it kind of
just<00:06:12.240> you<00:06:12.419> know<00:06:12.539> it<00:06:12.749> dries<00:06:13.229> funny<00:06:13.560> so<00:06:14.159> I<00:06:14.189> should

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
just you know it dries funny so I should

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.100 
just you know it dries funny so I should
just<00:06:14.490> squeeze<00:06:14.999> out<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.240> water<00:06:15.419> with<00:06:15.960> the
