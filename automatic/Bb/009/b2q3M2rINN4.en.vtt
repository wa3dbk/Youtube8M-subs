00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it to like about 150 and the scale I'd

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.880 
it to like about 150 and the scale I'd
put<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.470> let's<00:01:40.470> switch<00:01:41.040> point<00:01:42.030> five

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
put to that and let's switch point five

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
put to that and let's switch point five
so<00:01:43.890> i'll<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.490> bigger<00:01:45.259> actually<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.500> too

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
so i'll get bigger actually that's too

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.050 
so i'll get bigger actually that's too
big<00:01:47.130> i'll<00:01:47.399> put<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.850> point2<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
big i'll put it as point2 there we go so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.139 
big i'll put it as point2 there we go so
as<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.990> slides<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.159> gonna<00:01:53.369> go<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.670> but

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
as this slides over it's gonna go up but

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.510 
as this slides over it's gonna go up but
look<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.689> boring<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.860> each<00:01:56.159> letter

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
look how boring it is like each letter

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.870 
look how boring it is like each letter
goes<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.899> goes<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.409> down<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.490> let's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
goes up and just goes back down so let's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.240 
goes up and just goes back down so let's
just<00:02:00.030> control<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> i'm<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
just control see that and i'm going to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.600 
just control see that and i'm going to
move<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> about<00:02:03.299> 500

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
move this about 500

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.320 
move this about 500
just<00:02:05.600> add<00:02:05.870> 15<00:02:06.860> frames<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.899> then<00:02:09.280> next<00:02:10.280> at<00:02:10.729> 30

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
just add 15 frames and then next at 30

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.550 
just add 15 frames and then next at 30
or<00:02:11.900> let's<00:02:12.800> put<00:02:13.160> 45<00:02:13.480> I'm<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.050> move<00:02:15.260> this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
or let's put 45 I'm going to move this

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.730 
or let's put 45 I'm going to move this
all<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.130> way<00:02:16.160> over<00:02:17.710> 800<00:02:18.710> oh<00:02:19.870> wait<00:02:20.870> where<00:02:21.440> did<00:02:21.620> I

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
all the way over 800 oh wait where did I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.280 
all the way over 800 oh wait where did I
move<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.160> over<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.960> is<00:02:23.990> about

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
move it over here so this is about

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.420 
move it over here so this is about
negative<00:02:25.280> 500<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.870> I'll<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.350> put<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.040> to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
negative 500 so I'll just put this to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.970 
negative 500 so I'll just put this to
500<00:02:30.070> there<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.520> go<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:33.110> completely<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
500 there we go so it's completely the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.760 
500 there we go so it's completely the
opposite<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:34.970> play<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.740> to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
opposite and if we play it it's going to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.120 
opposite and if we play it it's going to
be<00:02:36.890> like<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.160> but<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:37.880> not<00:02:38.180> how<00:02:38.420> usually<00:02:39.200> in

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
be like that but it's not how usually in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.510 
be like that but it's not how usually in
shows<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.690> plan<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.250> got<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
shows it's not that plan so we got to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.570 
shows it's not that plan so we got to
add<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:44.060> delay<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.860> delay<00:02:46.220> we're<00:02:46.430> gonna

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
add a delay and that delay we're gonna

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.270 
add a delay and that delay we're gonna
put<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.060> spring<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.080> let's<00:02:48.440> go<00:02:48.680> back<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
put it on spring so let's go back on the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.400 
put it on spring so let's go back on the
test<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:50.150> we're<00:02:50.420> going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.690> go<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:51.140> your

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
test and we're going to go on your

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.030 
test and we're going to go on your
picture<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:52.100> mograph<00:02:53.140> protector<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.440> we'll

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
picture on mograph protector and we'll

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.590 
picture on mograph protector and we'll
go<00:02:55.520> soon<00:02:56.380> delay<00:02:57.380> there<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.860> go<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.850> what<00:02:59.480> we

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
go soon delay there you go and what we

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.010 
go soon delay there you go and what we
do<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.810> we<00:03:00.350> go<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.620> where<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.340> effector<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.570> we

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
do is we go to where the effector and we

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.670 
do is we go to where the effector and we
turn<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.830> spring<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.730> as<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:06.020> see<00:03:06.380> it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
turn that to spring and as you see it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.039 
turn that to spring and as you see it
bounces<00:03:07.489> up<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.120> down<00:03:08.239> it's<00:03:08.600> kind<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:08.989> a

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
bounces up and down it's kind of like a

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.949 
bounces up and down it's kind of like a
way<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.910> also<00:03:11.090> turn<00:03:11.570> up<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
way and you can also turn up the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.080 
way and you can also turn up the
strengthens<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:14.750> not<00:03:15.049> necessary<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.340> I'd

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
strengthens it's not necessary but I I'd

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.690 
strengthens it's not necessary but I I'd
recommend<00:03:17.450> turning<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.500> strength<00:03:19.400> to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
recommend turning up the strength to

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.810 
recommend turning up the strength to
like<00:03:19.910> 75<00:03:20.390> or<00:03:20.930> something<00:03:21.230> like<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:22.190> to

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
like 75 or something like that just to

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.890 
like 75 or something like that just to
make<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.560> better<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.950> also<00:03:25.760> once<00:03:26.420> when

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
make it look better and also once when

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.050 
make it look better and also once when
you're<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.200> plane<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.920> actually<00:03:28.820> add

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
you're on the plane you can actually add

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.449 
you're on the plane you can actually add
a<00:03:29.450> rotation<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> didn't<00:03:31.040> show<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.190> guys

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
a rotation to I didn't show you guys

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.910 
a rotation to I didn't show you guys
this<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.560> didn't<00:03:33.560> think<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.830> was

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
this because I didn't think it was

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.240 
this because I didn't think it was
really<00:03:34.190> necessary<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:35.410> let's<00:03:36.410> close<00:03:37.220> that

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
really necessary that let's close that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.140 
really necessary that let's close that
in<00:03:37.640> there<00:03:38.299> yeah<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.799> can<00:03:39.950> also<00:03:40.130> rotate<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
in there yeah but you can also rotate it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.750 
in there yeah but you can also rotate it
once<00:03:41.510> i<00:03:41.660> give<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:42.310> like<00:03:43.310> here<00:03:43.610> I'll<00:03:43.940> show<00:03:43.970> you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
once i give up like here I'll show you

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.789 
once i give up like here I'll show you
let's<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:46.940> show<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.330> all<00:03:48.140> right<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:48.709> you

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
let's just show this all right so you

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.340 
let's just show this all right so you
can<00:03:49.100> actually<00:03:49.370> add<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.700> rotation<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.810> know<00:03:51.140> why

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
can actually add a rotation I know why

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.000 
can actually add a rotation I know why
it's<00:03:51.530> not<00:03:51.709> working<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.780> usually<00:03:54.110> does

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
it's not working but it usually does

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.920 
it's not working but it usually does
work<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.480> ah<00:03:57.459> yeah<00:03:58.459> i<00:03:58.489> think<00:03:58.820> my<00:03:59.480> cinema

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
work so ah yeah i think my cinema

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.970 
work so ah yeah i think my cinema
forties<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.709> not<00:04:00.920> working<00:04:01.430> well<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:03.260> that's

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
forties is not working well so that's

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.960 
forties is not working well so that's
that<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.959> that's<00:04:05.959> how<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.290> do<00:04:06.769> it<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.250> i<00:04:07.549> hope
