00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
long we're talking about eight players

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.780 
long we're talking about eight players
in<00:00:30.359> double<00:00:31.199> digits<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.769> far<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.309> minutes<00:00:32.610> play

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
in double digits as far as minutes play

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.700 
in double digits as far as minutes play
they<00:00:33.030> go<00:00:33.149> real<00:00:33.360> deep<00:00:33.390> they're<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> veteran<00:00:34.320> club

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
they go real deep they're a veteran club

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.979 
they go real deep they're a veteran club
they<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> hit<00:00:35.430> forty<00:00:35.730> two<00:00:35.910> percent<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they can hit forty two percent of all I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.299 
they can hit forty two percent of all I
should<00:00:37.350> say<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.590> take<00:00:37.770> forty<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.190> percent

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
should say they take forty two percent

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
should say they take forty two percent
of<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.640> their<00:00:38.820> shots<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.600> area<00:00:39.899> code<00:00:39.960> three

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
of all their shots from area code three

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.720 
of all their shots from area code three
so<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.100> tough<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> defend

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so they're a little bit tough to defend

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.580 
so they're a little bit tough to defend
and<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.360> we've<00:00:42.540> seen<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> Arizona<00:00:43.410> this

with<00:01:00.719> me<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.649> don't<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> pac-12

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
with me I just don't like the pac-12
this<00:01:02.850> year<00:01:03.120> i<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> pac-12<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.769> one

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this year i think the pac-12 this is one

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200 
this year i think the pac-12 this is one
of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> weakest<00:01:05.489> years<00:01:05.729> i<00:01:05.880> don't<00:01:06.030> think

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of the weakest years i don't think

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
of the weakest years i don't think
there's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> dominant<00:01:06.930> team<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.409> that

media I always get a little scared
because<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.880> means<00:01:51.030> they're<00:01:51.270> slightly

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
because that means they're slightly

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
because that means they're slightly
overrated<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.409> far<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> point<00:01:52.979> spread<00:01:53.100> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
overrated as far as the point spread is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.039 
overrated as far as the point spread is
concerned<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.329> pac-12<00:01:54.689> has<00:01:54.930> been

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
concerned and the pac-12 has been

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.569 
concerned and the pac-12 has been
getting<00:01:55.259> ripped<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:55.680> three<00:01:55.890> months<00:01:56.219> which

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
getting ripped for three months which

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
getting ripped for three months which
means<00:01:56.820> Arizona<00:01:57.390> might<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> slightly

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
means Arizona might be slightly

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.570 
means Arizona might be slightly
undervalued<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.340> agree<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
undervalued in this game I agree and

undervalued in this game I agree and
I<00:02:00.610> think<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.450> pac-12<00:02:01.810> maybe<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.320> little<00:02:02.620> bit

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
I think the pac-12 maybe a little bit

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.620 
I think the pac-12 maybe a little bit
better<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.160> mean<00:02:03.400> I'm<00:02:03.520> maybe<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.210> little<00:02:04.360> partial

land<00:03:33.550> I<00:03:33.820> think<00:03:34.000> that's<00:03:34.150> going<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.330> be<00:03:34.480> a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
land I think that's going to be a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.990 
land I think that's going to be a
matchup<00:03:34.870> nightmare<00:03:35.140> for<00:03:35.800> Arizona<00:03:36.280> I'm<00:03:36.610> going

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
matchup nightmare for Arizona I'm going

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.880 
matchup nightmare for Arizona I'm going
to<00:03:37.060> go<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.209> Belmont<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.019> we've<00:03:38.500> seen<00:03:38.739> it

before from Arizona they've had some

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.750
