strumming the way I like to teach people
to<00:00:25.460> strum<00:00:25.759> from<00:00:25.789> day<00:00:26.360> one<00:00:26.660> using<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.590> fingers

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
to strum from day one using the fingers

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.409 
to strum from day one using the fingers
of<00:00:28.160> their<00:00:28.310> right<00:00:28.489> hand<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.119> we're<00:00:29.210> gonna<00:00:29.300> look

patterns<00:00:31.550> not<00:00:32.000> really<00:00:32.239> patterns<00:00:32.599> but<00:00:32.780> just

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
patterns not really patterns but just

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.350 
patterns not really patterns but just
the<00:00:33.440> technique<00:00:33.800> involved<00:00:34.309> on<00:00:34.460> using<00:00:35.270> your

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
the technique involved on using your

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.710 
the technique involved on using your
right<00:00:35.510> hand<00:00:35.750> fingers<00:00:36.200> for<00:00:36.590> strumming

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.420 

strumming<00:00:44.530> techniques<00:00:44.860> with<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.040> fingers

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
strumming techniques with the fingers

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.190 
strumming techniques with the fingers
first<00:00:46.150> threat<00:00:46.420> this<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.750> first<00:00:46.960> thing<00:00:47.079> I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
first threat this is the first thing I

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.360 
first threat this is the first thing I
like<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.470> have<00:00:47.590> people<00:00:47.860> learn<00:00:47.980> as<00:00:48.130> far<00:00:48.310> as

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
like to have people learn as far as

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.160 
like to have people learn as far as
strumming<00:00:48.700> goes<00:00:48.850> it's<00:00:49.360> learning<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.780> go<00:00:49.900> down

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
strumming goes it's learning to go down

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.620 
strumming goes it's learning to go down
I'm<00:00:50.470> playing<00:00:50.650> a<00:00:50.710> G<00:00:50.950> chord<00:00:50.980> but<00:00:51.700> learning<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.510> go

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
I'm playing a G chord but learning to go

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.810 
I'm playing a G chord but learning to go
down<00:00:52.900> across<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.350> strings<00:00:53.830> with<00:00:54.460> your<00:00:54.610> middle

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
down across the strings with your middle

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.580 
down across the strings with your middle
fingers<00:00:55.330> so<00:00:55.660> I<00:00:55.690> put<00:00:55.900> these<00:00:56.020> two<00:00:56.260> fingers

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
fingers so I put these two fingers

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.250 
fingers so I put these two fingers
together<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.660> brush<00:00:58.660> down<00:00:58.900> across<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
together and brush down across the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.040 
together and brush down across the
swings<00:00:59.620> with<00:00:59.739> them<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:01.090> motion<00:01:01.449> is

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
swings with them and that that motion is

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.799 
swings with them and that that motion is
a<00:01:02.650> combination<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.550> couple<00:01:03.670> things<00:01:04.000> you're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
a combination of a couple things you're

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.170 
a combination of a couple things you're
strumming<00:01:05.110> down<00:01:05.500> you're<00:01:06.070> moving<00:01:06.490> your<00:01:06.640> arm<00:01:07.000> a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
strumming down you're moving your arm a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.120 
strumming down you're moving your arm a
little<00:01:07.300> bit<00:01:07.450> your<00:01:08.050> wrist<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.470> little<00:01:08.619> bit<00:01:08.740> and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
little bit your wrist a little bit and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.920 
little bit your wrist a little bit and
you're<00:01:09.700> opening<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.210> fingers<00:01:10.540> as<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.780> go

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
you're opening your fingers as you go

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.850 
you're opening your fingers as you go
it's<00:01:11.170> not<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:12.300> I'm<00:01:13.300> only<00:01:13.479> moving<00:01:13.690> my<00:01:13.930> arm<00:01:14.140> no

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
it's not this I'm only moving my arm no

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.050 
it's not this I'm only moving my arm no
wrist<00:01:15.660> it's<00:01:16.660> not<00:01:16.899> this<00:01:17.170> only<00:01:17.470> wrist

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.160 

it's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
it's not this

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.000 
it's not this
only<00:01:23.500> fingers<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.760> combination<00:01:25.090> arm

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
only fingers it's a combination arm

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.609 
only fingers it's a combination arm
wrists<00:01:27.010> and<00:01:27.540> fingers<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:31.260> when<00:01:32.260> those<00:01:32.380> go

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
wrists and fingers so when those go

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.370 
wrists and fingers so when those go
fingers<00:01:33.040> strum<00:01:33.280> down<00:01:33.430> across<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.820> strings

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fingers strum down across the strings

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.990 
fingers strum down across the strings
it's<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.650> whole<00:01:35.830> series<00:01:36.250> released<00:01:36.580> kind<00:01:36.909> of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
it's this whole series released kind of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's this whole series released kind of
from<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.210> elbow<00:01:38.910> and<00:01:39.910> I'm<00:01:40.000> sort<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.450> unrolling

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
from the elbow and I'm sort of unrolling

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.990 
from the elbow and I'm sort of unrolling
my<00:01:41.200> hand<00:01:41.470> as<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.800> go

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
my hand as I go

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.540 
my hand as I go
so<00:01:43.570> that's<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.990> technique<00:01:44.410> for<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.800> downstroke

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
so that's the technique for a downstroke

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.300 
so that's the technique for a downstroke
in<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.090> finger<00:01:46.390> strum<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.710> technique<00:01:48.070> for<00:01:48.220> an

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
in the finger strum the technique for an

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.910 
in the finger strum the technique for an
up<00:01:48.400> is<00:01:48.610> use<00:01:49.540> your<00:01:49.690> index<00:01:49.960> finger<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.500> you

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
up is use your index finger and you

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.790 
up is use your index finger and you
brush<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.550> up<00:01:51.760> across<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.420> strings<00:01:52.800> it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
brush it up across the strings it's

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.980 
brush it up across the strings it's
almost<00:01:54.160> straight<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:55.150> relaxed<00:01:55.840> you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
almost straight it's it's relaxed you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.290 
almost straight it's it's relaxed you
don't<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.740> don't<00:01:56.830> drag<00:01:57.550> it<00:01:57.580> straight<00:01:57.880> hard

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
don't you don't drag it straight hard

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.710 
don't you don't drag it straight hard
like<00:01:58.510> that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
like that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.350 
like that
well<00:01:58.930> anyway<00:01:59.200> hard<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.590> explain<00:01:59.770> but<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
well anyway hard to explain but it's a

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.770 
well anyway hard to explain but it's a
light<00:02:01.600> brush<00:02:02.310> coming<00:02:03.310> up<00:02:03.550> across<00:02:03.880> usually

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
light brush coming up across usually

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.510 
light brush coming up across usually
just<00:02:05.050> aim<00:02:05.260> for<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.590> top<00:02:05.800> two<00:02:06.130> or<00:02:06.280> three

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
just aim for the top two or three

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.730 
just aim for the top two or three
strings<00:02:06.790> on<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.510> Down<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.110> try<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.350> hit<00:02:08.530> all<00:02:08.649> the

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
strings on a Down you try to hit all the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.230 
strings on a Down you try to hit all the
strings<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:09.100> cameras<00:02:09.460> show<00:02:09.670> me<00:02:09.790> all<00:02:09.940> six

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
strings you cameras show me all six

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.080 
strings you cameras show me all six
strings<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.750> g<00:02:10.990> chord<00:02:11.230> I'm<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.430> though<00:02:12.730> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
strings on this g chord I'm up though I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.540 
strings on this g chord I'm up though I
want<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:13.960> just<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> higher<00:02:14.440> ones<00:02:14.740> first

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
want to get just the higher ones first

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.750 
want to get just the higher ones first
second<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.030> third<00:02:16.300> strings<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.920> pattern

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
second and third strings so the pattern

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.570 
second and third strings so the pattern
the<00:02:18.940> technique<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.840> down<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.560> middles<00:02:20.860> up

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
the technique is down in the middles up

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.200 
the technique is down in the middles up
with<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.850> first

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.470 

so<00:02:28.210> just<00:02:28.480> practice<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:31.210> add

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so just practice that and then add

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.570 
so just practice that and then add
changing<00:02:32.080> chords<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.740> it<00:02:32.860> I'll<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> see

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.320 

today

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.100 

then<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.960> strumming<00:02:43.410> pattern<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.980> created<00:02:44.160> by

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
then a strumming pattern is created by

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.810 
then a strumming pattern is created by
leaving<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.260> some<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.740> those<00:02:46.830> strokes<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.610> one

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
leaving out some of those strokes so one

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.680 
leaving out some of those strokes so one
of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> most<00:02:48.090> important<00:02:48.480> things<00:02:48.630> about

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
of the most important things about

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.420 
of the most important things about
strumming<00:02:49.080> again<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.710> hand<00:02:49.920> moves

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
strumming again is that your hand moves

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.850 
strumming again is that your hand moves
down<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.970> up<00:02:51.150> constantly<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.320> dress<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.740> in

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
down and up constantly we dress this in

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.930 
down and up constantly we dress this in
a<00:02:52.890> lot<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.010> other<00:02:53.750> tips<00:02:54.750> too<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.700> down

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
a lot of other tips too but so this down

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.410 
a lot of other tips too but so this down
of<00:02:57.240> motion<00:02:57.780> never<00:02:58.320> stops<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.610> now<00:03:00.180> we're<00:03:00.330> going

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
of motion never stops so now we're going

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540 
of motion never stops so now we're going
to<00:03:00.480> create<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> pattern<00:03:01.140> in<00:03:01.500> 4/4<00:03:02.070> time<00:03:02.100> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
to create a pattern in 4/4 time that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.770 
to create a pattern in 4/4 time that
would<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.820> down<00:03:03.470> down<00:03:04.470> up<00:03:04.830> down<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.790> down<00:03:06.210> up

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
would go down down up down up down up

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840 
would go down down up down up down up
that<00:03:07.740> would<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> first<00:03:08.250> pattern<00:03:08.580> I'd<00:03:08.700> like

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
that would be the first pattern I'd like

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.130 
that would be the first pattern I'd like
people<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> learn<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:09.510> 4/4<00:03:09.960> time<00:03:09.990> 1<00:03:10.980> 2<00:03:11.880> &amp;<00:03:12.270> 3<00:03:12.300> &amp;<00:03:13.050> 4

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
people to learn in 4/4 time 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.950 
people to learn in 4/4 time 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4
&amp;<00:03:14.010> 1<00:03:14.400> 2<00:03:14.970> &amp;<00:03:15.750> 3<00:03:15.840> &amp;<00:03:16.620> 4<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.580> if<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:18.540> playing<00:03:18.750> that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
&amp; 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 and if we're playing that

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.130 
&amp; 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 and if we're playing that
in<00:03:19.050> 3/4<00:03:19.560> time<00:03:19.590> I'll<00:03:20.070> go<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.220> an<00:03:20.460> E<00:03:20.610> minor<00:03:20.760> chord

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
in 3/4 time I'll go to an E minor chord

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.180 
in 3/4 time I'll go to an E minor chord
3/4<00:03:22.140> time<00:03:22.380> would<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.770> down<00:03:23.400> down<00:03:24.270> up<00:03:24.570> down<00:03:24.990> up<00:03:25.500> 1

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
3/4 time would be down down up down up 1

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
3/4 time would be down down up down up 1
2<00:03:27.090> &amp;<00:03:27.420> 3<00:03:27.450> &amp;<00:03:28.260> 1<00:03:28.710> 2<00:03:29.280> &amp;<00:03:30.030> 3<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:32.960> so<00:03:33.960> learn<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.350> strum

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 2 &amp; 3 and so learn to strum

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.870 
2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 2 &amp; 3 and so learn to strum
with<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:34.800> fingers<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.310> work<00:03:35.490> on<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.700> in

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
with your fingers and work on it in

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.460 
with your fingers and work on it in
those<00:03:36.000> simple<00:03:36.330> patterns<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.870> 4<00:03:37.080> 4<00:03:37.290> pattern

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
those simple patterns the 4 4 pattern

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.460 
those simple patterns the 4 4 pattern
and<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.860> 3<00:03:38.040> 4<00:03:38.220> pattern

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:59.410 

Oh
