every<00:00:14.040> member<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.089> Weasley<00:00:15.450> family<00:00:16.010> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
every member of the Weasley family and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.040 
every member of the Weasley family and
then<00:00:17.369> use<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.320> Weasley<00:00:19.320> box<00:00:19.740> as<00:00:20.010> each<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> them

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
then use a Weasley box as each of them

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.349 
then use a Weasley box as each of them
so<00:00:22.050> when<00:00:22.859> you're<00:00:23.010> running<00:00:23.160> around<00:00:23.369> Hogwarts

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so when you're running around Hogwarts

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.910 
so when you're running around Hogwarts
and<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.630> could<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.930> any<00:00:25.199> time<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and this could be any time I'm just

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.259 
and this could be any time I'm just
doing<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.400> free<00:00:26.580> play<00:00:26.760> after<00:00:27.150> I've

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
doing this in free play after I've

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
doing this in free play after I've
beaten<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> game<00:00:28.010> you<00:00:29.010> always<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> Ron

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
beaten the game you always have a Ron

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.669 
beaten the game you always have a Ron
variant<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.050> switch<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.500> Ron

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
variant so you can just switch to Ron

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.220 
variant so you can just switch to Ron
use<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> Weasley<00:00:32.460> box<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.510> again<00:00:34.050> you've

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
use the Weasley box but again you've

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.770 
use the Weasley box but again you've
probably<00:00:34.410> already<00:00:34.739> used<00:00:35.219> pretty<00:00:36.180> much<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
probably already used pretty much all of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.470 
probably already used pretty much all of
them<00:00:36.960> during<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> story<00:00:38.270> especially<00:00:39.270> like

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
them during the story especially like

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.540 
them during the story especially like
Arthur<00:00:39.899> Molly<00:00:40.200> Fred<00:00:40.680> George<00:00:41.100> Ginny<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.550> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
Arthur Molly Fred George Ginny so you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.290 
Arthur Molly Fred George Ginny so you
might<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.789> need<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.329> use<00:00:45.480> Percy<00:00:46.079> bill<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
might just need to use Percy bill and

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.360 
might just need to use Percy bill and
Charlie<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:50.059> think<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:52.260> use<00:00:52.590> Fred<00:00:52.980> George

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
Charlie I think I don't use Fred George

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
Charlie I think I don't use Fred George

you just have to use one of them and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.919 
you just have to use one of them and
doesn't<00:02:09.670> even<00:02:09.790> have<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.090> be<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.360> standard<00:02:10.780> one

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
doesn't even have to be the standard one

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
doesn't even have to be the standard one
so<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.500> me<00:02:11.860> screwing<00:02:12.280> up<00:02:12.370> trying<00:02:12.640> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so here you see me screwing up trying to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.340 
so here you see me screwing up trying to
use<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.970> potion<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.630> was<00:02:13.750> driving<00:02:13.930> me<00:02:14.110> crazy

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
use the potion it was driving me crazy

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.960 
use the potion it was driving me crazy
so<00:02:17.350> there<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.680> multiple<00:02:17.920> variants<00:02:18.580> for<00:02:18.790> many

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
so there are multiple variants for many

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
so there are multiple variants for many
of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> Weasleys<00:02:19.570> but<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:20.080> have<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.320> use

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
of the Weasleys but you just have to use

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.440 
of the Weasleys but you just have to use
any<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.160> them<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:22.060> each<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:25.239> now<00:02:25.360> I'm

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
any of them for each so now I'm

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.210
