really like how clear the ice block is
kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.120> similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> default<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
kind of very similar to default but a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.790 
kind of very similar to default but a
lot<00:00:46.680> clearer<00:00:47.629> mycelium<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.989> your<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.440> blocks

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
lot clearer mycelium and your or blocks

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
lot clearer mycelium and your or blocks
again<00:00:50.190> there's<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:50.910> exciting

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
again there's not really exciting

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
again there's not really exciting
happening<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.780> blocks<00:00:52.079> iron<00:00:53.070> bars<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
happening the or blocks iron bars can

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
happening the or blocks iron bars can
have<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.910> kinda<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.660> cross<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.110> between

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
have that kinda little cross in between

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.110 
have that kinda little cross in between
them<00:00:55.559> maybe<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.070> India<00:00:56.370> room<00:00:56.579> board<00:00:56.940> I've

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
them maybe that's India room board I've

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900 
them maybe that's India room board I've
never<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.960> sponge<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> teaspoons<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
never know it's sponge and teaspoons the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.479 
never know it's sponge and teaspoons the
exact<00:01:00.149> same<00:01:00.329> TT<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.800> different<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
exact same TT is a very different it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.870 
exact same TT is a very different it's
like<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.850> box<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.040> row<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.250> blocks<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
in a block this anyway I could explain

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
in a block this anyway I could explain
them<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.760> there's<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.360> five
