this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.650> trick<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> I've<00:01:35.070> been

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this is a little trick that I've been

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
this is a little trick that I've been
doing<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> while<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.750> involves

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
doing for a while and it just involves

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.140 
doing for a while and it just involves
contouring<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> highlighting<00:01:38.220> around<00:01:39.030> your

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
contouring and highlighting around your

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
lips to make certain areas sunken and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
lips to make certain areas sunken and
certain<00:01:42.030> areas<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:42.689> highlight<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.350> come

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
certain areas more highlight and come

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.899 
certain areas more highlight and come
forward<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.100> we're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> start<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.759> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
forward so we're going to start out with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.819

to<00:03:08.200> talk<00:03:08.410> when<00:03:08.680> you're<00:03:08.769> trying<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.100> draw<00:03:09.310> on

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
to talk when you're trying to draw on

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.030 
to talk when you're trying to draw on
your<00:03:09.430> lips<00:03:09.700> what<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.150> want<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.690> line

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
your lips what you want to do is line

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.580 
your lips what you want to do is line
just<00:03:12.510> outside<00:03:13.510> where<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:13.959> natural<00:03:14.140> lip<00:03:14.560> line

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
just outside where your natural lip line

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.150 
just outside where your natural lip line
is<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.549> that's<00:03:15.730> fine<00:03:15.940> there<00:03:16.890> I'm<00:03:17.890> going<00:03:18.100> to

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
is so that's fine there I'm going to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.119 
is so that's fine there I'm going to
line<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:18.670> here

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.740 

and<00:03:27.129> I<00:03:27.189> like<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.489> keep<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.819> quite<00:03:28.000> dark<00:03:28.269> under

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
and I like to keep it quite dark under

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.839 
and I like to keep it quite dark under
the<00:03:28.870> bottom<00:03:29.079> bit<00:03:29.379> of<00:03:29.500> my<00:03:29.650> lip<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.069> then<00:03:30.579> to

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
the bottom bit of my lip and then to

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.670 
the bottom bit of my lip and then to
even<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.299> air<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.689> the<00:03:31.810> top<00:03:31.840> lip<00:03:32.260> I'm<00:03:32.409> going<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
even the air on the top lip I'm going to

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.039 
even the air on the top lip I'm going to
go<00:03:32.769> ahead<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.459> start<00:03:34.120> lining<00:03:34.329> just<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> bit

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
go ahead and start lining just a bit

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.699 
go ahead and start lining just a bit
above<00:03:35.349> my<00:03:35.409> natural<00:03:35.650> lip<00:03:36.099> line<00:03:40.140> my<00:03:41.140> bit<00:03:41.379> I<00:03:41.530> mean

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
above my natural lip line my bit I mean

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:49.370 
above my natural lip line my bit I mean
a<00:03:41.739> lot

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 

so<00:03:50.010> already<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.520> see<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.910> difference

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
so already you can see the difference

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.570 
so already you can see the difference
that<00:03:52.110> there<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.500> no<00:03:52.680> natural<00:03:52.950> lip<00:03:53.340> line<00:03:53.370> and

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
that there is no natural lip line and

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.060 
that there is no natural lip line and
then<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.240> is<00:03:54.420> where<00:03:54.630> I've<00:03:54.780> aligned<00:03:55.170> so<00:03:56.010> I'm

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
then that is where I've aligned so I'm

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.710 
then that is where I've aligned so I'm
kind<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.340> going<00:03:56.490> over<00:03:56.700> my<00:03:57.030> natural<00:03:57.390> lip<00:03:57.480> line

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
kind of going over my natural lip line

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.520 
kind of going over my natural lip line
and<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:58.140> bit<00:03:58.410> above<00:03:59.840> I'm<00:04:00.840> going<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.020> do<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> same

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
and a bit above I'm going to do the same

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.520 
and a bit above I'm going to do the same
on<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.800> other<00:04:01.830> side<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.870> when<00:04:07.020> doing<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.380> I

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
on the other side and when doing this I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.840 
on the other side and when doing this I
don't<00:04:07.710> like<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.010> use<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.250> tip<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.640> pencil

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
don't like to use the tip of the pencil

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.000 
don't like to use the tip of the pencil
I<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.450> lay<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.840> its<00:04:09.870> side<00:04:10.080> and<00:04:10.260> drag<00:04:10.830> it

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
I like to lay it on its side and drag it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.479 
I like to lay it on its side and drag it
down<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.790> makes<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.060> thicker<00:04:12.300> line<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> for

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
down so it makes a thicker line so for

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.790 
down so it makes a thicker line so for
this<00:04:17.610> area<00:04:17.850> here<00:04:18.300> I<00:04:18.480> typically<00:04:19.080> don't<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
this area here I typically don't like to

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.760 
this area here I typically don't like to
have<00:04:20.209> pointy<00:04:21.209> kind<00:04:21.480> of<00:04:21.600> keepers<00:04:21.989> by<00:04:22.230> area<00:04:22.590> I

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
have pointy kind of keepers by area I

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.040 
have pointy kind of keepers by area I
like<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.100> have<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.430> more<00:04:24.420> straight<00:04:24.720> across

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
like to have it more straight across

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.780 
like to have it more straight across
will<00:04:25.440> essentially<00:04:25.740> give<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.280> bigger

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
will essentially give you a bigger

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.120 
will essentially give you a bigger
looking<00:04:27.780> lip<00:04:32.930> but<00:04:33.930> it's<00:04:34.050> all<00:04:34.260> depending<00:04:34.980> on

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
looking lip but it's all depending on

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.590 
looking lip but it's all depending on
how<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.430> like<00:04:35.730> your<00:04:35.760> lips<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.240> look<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:39.450> now

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
how you like your lips to look so now

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.420 
how you like your lips to look so now
for<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.930> details<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.800> lip<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.310> is

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
for the details of the lip and this is

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580 
for the details of the lip and this is
just<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.760> little<00:04:41.940> trickier<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.450> do<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.440> make

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
just a little trickier to do to make

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.590 
just a little trickier to do to make
them<00:04:43.710> look<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.920> bit<00:04:44.040> more<00:04:44.190> natural<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.910> plump

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
them look a bit more natural and plump

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.930 
them look a bit more natural and plump
all<00:04:46.170> I'm<00:04:46.290> going<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.500> do<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.950> draw<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
all I'm going to do is draw in the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.720 
all I'm going to do is draw in the
natural<00:04:48.510> creases<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.260> whale<00:04:49.620> lip<00:04:49.950> wood<00:04:50.370> crease

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
natural creases of whale lip wood crease

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.220 
natural creases of whale lip wood crease
if<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.090> was<00:04:51.300> quite<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.660> large<00:04:52.050> lips<00:04:52.410> here<00:04:54.230> here

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
if it was quite a large lips here here

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.860 
if it was quite a large lips here here
here<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.070> here

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
here and here

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.510 
here and here
so<00:04:57.870> now<00:04:58.050> we've<00:04:58.230> got<00:04:58.440> ridiculous-looking<00:04:59.010> lips

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
so now we've got ridiculous-looking lips

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.770 
so now we've got ridiculous-looking lips
I'm<00:04:59.700> going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.910> go<00:05:00.060> ahead<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.450> add<00:05:00.630> these

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
I'm going to go ahead and add these

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.230 
I'm going to go ahead and add these
lipstick<00:05:01.260> so<00:05:01.860> if<00:05:02.010> it's<00:05:02.130> real<00:05:02.430> awkward<00:05:02.640> zooming

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
lipstick so if it's real awkward zooming

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.940 
lipstick so if it's real awkward zooming
it's<00:05:03.600> going<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.840> start<00:05:04.080> by<00:05:04.200> dabbing<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.680> on

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
it's going to start by dabbing that on

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:13.510 
it's going to start by dabbing that on
so<00:05:05.190> we<00:05:05.280> don't<00:05:05.310> erase<00:05:05.850> any<00:05:06.090> of<00:05:06.210> these<00:05:06.390> lines

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.400 

so<00:05:14.120> now<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.330> can<00:05:14.509> see<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.900> looks<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.229> we've

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
so now you can see it looks like we've

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:22.960 
so now you can see it looks like we've
got<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:16.030> bit<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.210> plump<00:05:17.509> lip<00:05:17.720> going<00:05:17.960> on<00:05:21.819> so<00:05:22.819> now

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
little bit of practice but once you get

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.380 
little bit of practice but once you get
there<00:06:27.080> you<00:06:27.710> will<00:06:27.740> just<00:06:28.370> love<00:06:28.820> it<00:06:28.970> because<00:06:29.090> I

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
there you will just love it because I

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.760 
there you will just love it because I
wear<00:06:29.600> this<00:06:29.750> like<00:06:29.900> every<00:06:30.170> single<00:06:30.350> day<00:06:30.620> now

wear this like every single day now

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.860

obviously<00:06:31.490> you<00:06:31.610> can<00:06:31.820> make<00:06:31.850> them<00:06:32.240> a<00:06:32.270> lot<00:06:32.630> bigger

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.630

than<00:06:32.960> what<00:06:33.170> I<00:06:33.230> did<00:06:33.410> but<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.800> think<00:06:33.920> this<00:06:34.250> is<00:06:34.400> a

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
than what I did but I think this is a

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.910 
than what I did but I think this is a
more<00:06:35.270> natural<00:06:35.300> way<00:06:35.750> because<00:06:36.140> I<00:06:36.260> do<00:06:36.320> have<00:06:36.500> quite

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
more natural way because I do have quite

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.430 
more natural way because I do have quite
small<00:06:37.340> lips<00:06:37.580> if<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:37.970> made<00:06:38.150> them<00:06:38.450> bigger<00:06:39.260> than

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
small lips if I made them bigger than

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.420 
small lips if I made them bigger than
what<00:06:39.530> they<00:06:39.650> are<00:06:39.680> now<00:06:39.920> it'd<00:06:40.040> feel<00:06:40.130> like<00:06:40.190> it

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
what they are now it'd feel like it

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.070 
what they are now it'd feel like it
would<00:06:40.520> look<00:06:40.640> quite<00:06:40.940> unnatural<00:06:41.360> now<00:06:41.840> if<00:06:41.990> you

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
would look quite unnatural now if you

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.570 
would look quite unnatural now if you
