00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
they had a good football team that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.820 
they had a good football team that
needed<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.870> know<00:02:11.900> obviously<00:02:12.080> continue<00:02:12.590> to

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
needed to you know obviously continue to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.220 
needed to you know obviously continue to
grow<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.250> they're<00:02:13.910> two<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> big<00:02:14.870> anchors

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
grow and they're two of the big anchors

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.780 
grow and they're two of the big anchors
on<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.560> football<00:02:15.740> team<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> offensive

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
on this football team on the offensive

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.520 
on this football team on the offensive
side<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.090> defensive<00:02:17.540> side<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.870> i<00:02:18.050> think<00:02:18.440> they

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
side the defensive side so i think they

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.260 
side the defensive side so i think they
carry<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.890> lot<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.280> confidence<00:02:19.850> with<00:02:20.090> them

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
carry a lot of that confidence with them

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.630 
carry a lot of that confidence with them
because<00:02:21.170> they<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.130> what<00:02:22.310> they're<00:02:22.459> capable

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
because they know what they're capable

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.820 
because they know what they're capable
of<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.330> they<00:02:23.480> know<00:02:23.630> what<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:24.380> football<00:02:24.800> team

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
of and they know what this football team

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.479 
of and they know what this football team
can<00:02:25.580> do<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.660> continues<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.650> grow<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.220> i

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
can do if it continues to grow so i

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.850 
can do if it continues to grow so i
think<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.360> permeates<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.410> rest<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
think that permeates the rest of the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.270 
think that permeates the rest of the
group<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.680> that's<00:02:33.830> why<00:02:34.040> those<00:02:34.250> guys

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
group and you know that's why those guys

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.850 
group and you know that's why those guys
relieve<00:02:34.760> most<00:02:35.330> most<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.080> first<00:02:36.290> moments

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
relieve most most of the first moments

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.430 
relieve most most of the first moments
is<00:02:37.400> there<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> rotation<00:02:38.390> air<00:02:38.600> does<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.020> matter

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
is there a rotation air does it matter

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.310 
is there a rotation air does it matter
if<00:02:39.650> there<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.100> rotation<00:02:40.670> there<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.320> yeah

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
if there is a rotation there and yeah

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.110 
if there is a rotation there and yeah
there's<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.620> there's<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.070> clear<00:02:43.340> rotation<00:02:43.940> it's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
there's a there's a clear rotation it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
there's a there's a clear rotation it's
it's<00:02:44.930> 5050<00:02:47.350> every<00:02:48.350> was<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.769> first<00:02:49.040> group

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it's 5050 every was in the first group

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's 5050 every was in the first group
today<00:02:50.739> Malik<00:02:51.739> started<00:02:52.160> yesterday<00:02:53.799> it's<00:02:54.799> been

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
today Malik started yesterday it's been

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.729 
today Malik started yesterday it's been
balanced<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.450> they're<00:02:56.690> they're<00:02:57.260> splitting

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
balanced so they're they're splitting

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.830 
balanced so they're they're splitting
the<00:02:58.640> reps<00:02:59.269> with<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.260> first<00:03:00.500> group<00:03:00.650> and

the reps with the first group and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.970 
the reps with the first group and
they'll<00:03:02.840> continue<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.290> do<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.620> through<00:03:03.860> this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
they'll continue to do that through this

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.250 
they'll continue to do that through this
