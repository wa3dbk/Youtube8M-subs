00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.850 
the first thing we have is a variable at
the<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.470> top

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the very top

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.590 
the very top
it's<00:01:49.979> called<00:01:50.220> weapons<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> pipe<00:01:51.299> game

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it's called weapons it's a pipe game

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
it's called weapons it's a pipe game
object<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.670> brackets

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
object then we have two little brackets

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690 
object then we have two little brackets
right<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.200> means<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:55.649> array<00:01:55.950> now

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
right here and this means an array now

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
right here and this means an array now
this<00:01:57.000> array<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.509> hold<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> our<00:01:58.140> weapons

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this array will hold all of our weapons

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.399 
this array will hold all of our weapons
so<00:01:59.210> right<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:00.329> it's<00:02:00.479> empty<00:02:00.780> which<00:02:01.020> means<00:02:01.229> we

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
so right now it's empty which means we

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.920 
so right now it's empty which means we
can<00:02:01.590> expand<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.520> decrease<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> size<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
can expand or decrease the size of the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.740 
can expand or decrease the size of the
array<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.829> wish<00:02:05.119> now<00:02:06.119> when<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.450> first

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
array as we wish now when we first

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.779 
array as we wish now when we first
started<00:02:07.020> off<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.799> function<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:08.580> we

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
started off in the function start we

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.990 
started off in the function start we
want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.119> ahead<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.390> select<00:02:09.509> weapon<00:02:10.319> zero

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
want to go ahead and select weapon zero

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.070 
want to go ahead and select weapon zero
now<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.780> you're<00:02:13.020> familiar<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.500> arrays

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
now if you're familiar with arrays

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.650 
now if you're familiar with arrays
you<00:02:14.350> know<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.010> starts<00:02:15.310> off<00:02:15.460> at<00:02:15.730> zero<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
you know that it starts off at zero so

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.120 
you know that it starts off at zero so
if<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.840> want<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.050> select<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.380> first<00:02:17.650> object

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
if you want to select the first object

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.740 
if you want to select the first object
in<00:02:18.280> an<00:02:18.520> array<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.240> want<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.420> make<00:02:19.510> sure<00:02:19.540> it's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
in an array you want to make sure it's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.810 
in an array you want to make sure it's
set<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:19.930> zero<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.160> right<00:02:21.280> now<00:02:21.430> we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
set to zero so right now we're going to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.430 
set to zero so right now we're going to
start<00:02:22.000> off<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.210> our<00:02:22.540> pistol<00:02:22.990> which<00:02:23.260> is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
start off with our pistol which is

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.060 
start off with our pistol which is
actually<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.250> first<00:02:24.580> weapon<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.270> our<00:02:25.450> array

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
actually the first weapon in our array

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.840 
actually the first weapon in our array
so<00:02:27.070> then<00:02:27.220> we're<00:02:27.310> gonna<00:02:27.400> jump<00:02:27.580> down<00:02:27.670> through

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
so then we're gonna jump down through

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.520 
so then we're gonna jump down through
function<00:02:28.150> update<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.050> two<00:02:29.260> if

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
function update and we have two if

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.410 
function update and we have two if
statements<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.250> they're<00:02:30.760> both<00:02:30.880> exactly<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
statements and they're both exactly the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
statements and they're both exactly the
same<00:02:31.570> set<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.020> they<00:02:32.710> change<00:02:33.100> different

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
same set the they change different

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.950 
same set the they change different
weapons<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.360> first<00:02:34.540> one's<00:02:34.690> gonna<00:02:34.810> say

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
weapons so the first one's gonna say

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.500 
weapons so the first one's gonna say
input<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.530> gate<00:02:35.740> key<00:02:35.890> down<00:02:36.100> 1<00:02:36.850> which<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
input that gate key down 1 which is the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.110 
input that gate key down 1 which is the
number<00:02:37.540> 1<00:02:38.020> on<00:02:38.290> our<00:02:38.440> keyboard<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:40.000> we

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
number 1 on our keyboard and then we

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.690 
number 1 on our keyboard and then we
have<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.360> Select<00:02:40.630> weapon<00:02:41.050> at<00:02:41.260> 0<00:02:41.530> now<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.580> is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
have the Select weapon at 0 now this is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.220 
have the Select weapon at 0 now this is
going<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.880> select<00:02:43.060> our<00:02:43.240> first<00:02:43.540> weapon<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:44.050> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
going to select our first weapon in the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.770 
going to select our first weapon in the
array<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:46.060> one's<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.450> select<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
array and this one's going to select the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.830 
array and this one's going to select the
second<00:02:47.320> weapon<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.920> our<00:02:48.040> way<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:49.360> if<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.690> have

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
second weapon in our way now if you have

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.320 
second weapon in our way now if you have
three<00:02:50.380> or<00:02:50.470> more<00:02:50.530> weapons<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.250> your<00:02:51.790> red<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
three or more weapons in your red and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.699 
three or more weapons in your red and
obviously<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:52.660> want<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> go<00:02:52.959> ahead<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.200> make

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
obviously you want to go ahead and make

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.930 
obviously you want to go ahead and make
sure<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.130> copy<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.550> paste<00:02:54.760> this<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
sure that you copy and paste this and

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.710 
sure that you copy and paste this and
include<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.720> third<00:02:56.320> one<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:56.709> well<00:02:57.660> alright<00:02:58.660> then

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
include a third one as well alright then

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.020 
include a third one as well alright then
finally<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.470> Select<00:02:59.830> weapon<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.820> is

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
finally the Select weapon right here is

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.170 
finally the Select weapon right here is
actually<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.660> function<00:03:01.930> down<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.880> this

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
actually the function down here so this

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.000 
actually the function down here so this
function<00:03:04.630> says<00:03:04.840> select<00:03:05.050> weapon<00:03:05.470> index

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
function says select weapon index

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.150 
function says select weapon index
integer<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:07.570> we<00:03:07.630> have<00:03:07.750> these<00:03:07.870> two<00:03:08.080> lines

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
integer and then we have these two lines

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.770 
integer and then we have these two lines
at<00:03:09.160> least<00:03:09.250> two<00:03:09.490> lines<00:03:09.670> basically<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.330> toggle

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
at least two lines basically just toggle

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.350 
at least two lines basically just toggle
between<00:03:10.870> whatever<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:12.010> our<00:03:12.160> array<00:03:12.430> from

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
between whatever is in our array from

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.020 
between whatever is in our array from
true<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.780> false<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.500> vice<00:03:14.650> versa<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:16.000> it's

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
true to false and vice versa so it's

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.970 
true to false and vice versa so it's
gonna<00:03:16.240> go<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.480> select<00:03:16.630> everything<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.620> it's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
gonna go and select everything and it's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.240 
gonna go and select everything and it's
going<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.190> set<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.310> false<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.820> then<00:03:19.060> whatever

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
going to set to false and then whatever

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.290 
going to set to false and then whatever
object<00:03:21.250> we<00:03:21.370> select<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.850> our<00:03:21.970> array<00:03:22.150> it's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
object we select out of our array it's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.210 
object we select out of our array it's
going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> set<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.810> true<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.100> all

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
going to set it to true so that's all

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.470 
going to set it to true so that's all
its<00:03:24.340> really<00:03:24.400> doing<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:24.970> toggling<00:03:25.420> between

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
its really doing just toggling between

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.900 
its really doing just toggling between
the<00:03:26.200> different<00:03:26.560> objects<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.100> our<00:03:27.250> array<00:03:27.580> here
