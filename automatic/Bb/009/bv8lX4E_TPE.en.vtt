to begin with no two of them are exactly

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.250 
to begin with no two of them are exactly
alike<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.679> call<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:32.060> God<00:00:32.090> gave<00:00:32.810> to<00:00:33.400> Moses<00:00:34.400> is

alike the call that God gave to Moses is

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.750 
alike the call that God gave to Moses is
quite<00:00:36.260> different<00:00:36.590> than<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.010> call<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:37.730> God

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
quite different than the call that God

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.800 
quite different than the call that God
gave<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.360> Elijah<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.060> quite<00:00:41.060> different<00:00:41.630> from

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
gave to Elijah and quite different from

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.460 
gave to Elijah and quite different from
the<00:00:42.020> call<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.620> he<00:00:42.770> gave<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:43.040> David<00:00:43.700> and<00:00:44.470> quite

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
the call that he gave to David and quite

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.350 
the call that he gave to David and quite
different<00:00:46.040> from<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.340> call<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:46.970> he<00:00:47.060> gave<00:00:47.330> to

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
different from the call that he gave to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.740 
different from the call that he gave to
Gideon<00:00:47.990> you<00:00:48.920> will<00:00:49.130> find<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.730> God<00:00:50.000> used<00:00:50.390> a

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
Gideon you will find that God used a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.000 
Gideon you will find that God used a
different<00:00:51.020> method<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:52.160> all<00:00:52.880> of<00:00:53.420> those<00:00:54.110> cases

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
different method in all of those cases

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.350 
different method in all of those cases
and<00:00:55.450> God<00:00:56.450> still<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.470> think<00:00:58.040> uses<00:00:58.850> different

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
and God still I think uses different

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.740 
and God still I think uses different
methods<00:00:59.930> in<00:01:00.280> calling<00:01:01.280> now<00:01:01.790> I<00:01:02.150> think<00:01:02.240> there<00:01:02.720> are

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
methods in calling now I think there are

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.590 
methods in calling now I think there are
one<00:01:03.590> or<00:01:03.740> two<00:01:03.770> great<00:01:04.250> principles<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.390> you

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
one or two great principles that you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.340 
one or two great principles that you
find<00:01:05.930> in<00:01:06.200> all<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:07.100> these<00:01:07.310> calls<00:01:07.900> first<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.200> all

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
find in all of these calls first of all

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.100 
find in all of these calls first of all
when<00:01:10.040> practically<00:01:10.880> all<00:01:11.120> of<00:01:11.180> them<00:01:11.690> there<00:01:11.930> was<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
when practically all of them there was a

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.970 
when practically all of them there was a
reluctance<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.460> part<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.980> individual

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
reluctance on the part of the individual

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.810 
reluctance on the part of the individual
to<00:01:16.340> hear<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.120> heed<00:01:17.930> God's<00:01:18.380> call<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
to hear and heed God's call that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.010 
to hear and heed God's call that
certainly<00:01:20.420> was<00:01:20.780> true<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.560> Moses<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.750> was

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
certainly was true of Moses and that was

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.650 
certainly was true of Moses and that was
not<00:01:24.350> true<00:01:24.710> apparently<00:01:25.370> of<00:01:25.460> Abraham<00:01:26.120> but<00:01:26.480> it

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
not true apparently of Abraham but it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.910

was<00:01:27.260> true<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:27.890> Moses<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:30.020> find<00:01:30.409> then

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
was true of Moses and you find then

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
a reluctance in accepting such a high

know that and he was looking down over

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.490 
know that and he was looking down over
the<00:03:09.530> city<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:09.950> Jerusalem<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.810> he<00:03:11.930> never<00:03:12.170> said

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
the city of Jerusalem and he never said

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.610 
the city of Jerusalem and he never said
a<00:03:12.530> word<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:13.250> he<00:03:13.280> pointed<00:03:14.150> me<00:03:14.210> down<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.410> that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620

city<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.550> pointed<00:03:17.210> and<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:18.410> always<00:03:19.040> had<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
city just pointed and I always had a

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.830 
city just pointed and I always had a
suspicion<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.320> was<00:03:21.800> maybe<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.850> call<00:03:23.390> to

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
suspicion that that was maybe a call to

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.920 
suspicion that that was maybe a call to
the<00:03:23.959> ministry<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.920> he<00:03:25.280> was<00:03:25.490> calling<00:03:26.030> me<00:03:26.060> well

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the ministry that he was calling me well

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.880 
the ministry that he was calling me well
after<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.650> got<00:03:28.100> saved<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.990> minute<00:03:30.709> I

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
after that I got saved and the minute I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.720 
after that I got saved and the minute I
got<00:03:31.130> saved<00:03:31.490> I<00:03:31.820> honestly<00:03:32.810> felt<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:34.190> at<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
got saved I honestly felt that at the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.180

boy and couldn't go to school because I

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.370

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
myself so very frankly I did not feel I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.720 
myself so very frankly I did not feel I
could<00:03:53.120> pursue<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:54.080> call<00:03:54.770> to<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> ministry<00:03:55.670> and

could pursue a call to the ministry and

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.180 
could pursue a call to the ministry and
I<00:03:55.820> didn't<00:03:56.150> think<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.480> could<00:03:56.510> enter<00:03:57.200> at<00:03:57.410> all<00:03:57.800> and

shred<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.380> doubt<00:05:21.620> even<00:05:22.370> in<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.820> darkest<00:05:23.330> time

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630
