00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.250
 France's rail network decided to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 delete level crossing 19 located 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 in mennecy in ile-de-france considered 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.199
 as a concern 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.449
 this crossing will be replaced 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.420
 by a rail bridge sat will be that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.609
 rff entrusted the project management Thursday 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 evening 22 o'clock the rail traffic is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.029
 interrupted in the dark night the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.510
 first construction machines are activated 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.830
 we have a frame that was made next 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.200
 to have keren and who is being 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.969
 set up during a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 72-hour traffic interception 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 during which we are going to have filed the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 voice we push the bridge and we will rest 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.890
 the voice and its equipment so as to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 what next monday at 5 am the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.300
 morning trains can circulate 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.590
 morning of the second day the railways 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.590
 and catenaries or missing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 we had the tracks from 5 hours 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 we started a first phase of big 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.809
 earthworks we had about 1500 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.379
 cubic meters to 2000 cubic meters of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 Earth 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 now we just come down a little 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720
 more finely and have done well all to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 small 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.850
 so we left for ten hours 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.800
 sinking this step is to move 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.230
 gradually the book up to its 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.390
 final location for this site 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.520
 advanced technology is use 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.650
 hydraulic cylinders placed at 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.050
 the back two books are advanced this 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.200
 2000 ton bridge of three meters per 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.730
 about hour 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.970
 knowing that we are 32 meters 50 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.590
 for these two the big constraint 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.180
 this year ie to make the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.190
 lanes in time for 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.640
 the moment it goes well we say 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.640
 in time 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.619
 the timing is tight to limit 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.650
 the extent of the earthwork 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.909
 the sinking must be very precise 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 when I could see 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.310
 openings of the wheat of the fathers 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 match pile hair at the opening of 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.810
 the carved which avoids having 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.970
 embankments in the end that could be 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.319
 destabilize over time when the 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.700
 crushed will be recirculated 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.340
 if everything goes well with him 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.769
 book should be in place 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.170
 which will remain the replacement phase and 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:37.030
 emissions may 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:37.540
 show them far too close he 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.550
 is midnight 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.800
 we just put in place 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.490
 finish setting up a book 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.350
 it is set to millimeter a beautiful 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.410
 performance 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.890
 we will close the site and we will all 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.890
 go to bed 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.100
 the yard is not finished for 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.870
 both the msf and sncf teams take the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 relay to put back the tracks and the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.940
 catenaries so that the first trains 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.120
 can actually circulated as early as Monday 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.120
 morning
