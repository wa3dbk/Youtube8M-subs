00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
contracts week to a week and from what

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.370 
contracts week to a week and from what
I've<00:00:22.769> heard<00:00:23.029> sometimes<00:00:24.029> these<00:00:24.359> players<00:00:24.779> well

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I've heard sometimes these players well

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.009 
I've heard sometimes these players well
just<00:00:25.619> flat<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:26.160> reject<00:00:26.939> your<00:00:27.119> contracts<00:00:27.840> so

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
just flat out reject your contracts so

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.140 
just flat out reject your contracts so
my<00:00:28.170> strategy<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.949> past<00:00:29.279> years<00:00:29.490> where<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.910> just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
my strategy from past years where I just

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
my strategy from past years where I just
low-ball<00:00:30.480> people<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> keep<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.590> inching<00:00:32.009> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
low-ball people and keep on inching it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
low-ball people and keep on inching it
up<00:00:32.219> until<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:32.669> accept<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:34.079> won't<00:00:34.290> be

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
up until they accept probably won't be

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.260 
up until they accept probably won't be
effective<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> year<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.000> will

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
effective this year because they will

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
effective this year because they will
flat<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.719> reject<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> free<00:00:38.340> agency

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
flat out reject it and go to free agency

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.060 
flat out reject it and go to free agency
so<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.420> backfire<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.950> I'm<00:00:41.040> showing

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so it could backfire so what I'm showing

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.580 
so it could backfire so what I'm showing
you<00:00:41.309> guys<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.760> basically<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you guys here basically what I do is I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.310 
you guys here basically what I do is I
like<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.070> look<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> rosters<00:00:45.660> for

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
like to look at all the rosters for

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.580 
like to look at all the rosters for
every<00:00:46.649> single<00:00:46.920> team<00:00:47.329> well<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> years<00:00:49.260> past

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
every single team well in the years past

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
every single team well in the years past
I<00:00:49.860> would<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.850> teams<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> filter

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
I would just go to all teams and filter

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
I would just go to all teams and filter
by<00:00:51.960> left<00:00:52.260> guard<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.949> can't<00:00:53.190> filter<00:00:53.489> by

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
by left guard but you can't filter by

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.920 
by left guard but you can't filter by
all<00:00:53.850> teams<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.570> through<00:00:54.780> each

all teams so we have to go through each
team<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.739> i'm<00:00:55.860> basically<00:00:56.039> looking<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.850> left
