00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.260
 occasionally i get as a very big one 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.120
 In the gaming area youtuber inquire from 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.340
 developers and publishers if I do not 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.650
 imagine this or that game 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.990
 can be quite logical 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.000
 the most important thing for a game is that 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.740
 people know that it exists 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.779
 but then there are those too 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.920
 Developers which apparently so much 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.679
 hope that you play her 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.420
 Imagine that indirectly without demand 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.670
 all sorts of people stickies 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.350
 send out as a rule awaken this 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.720
 but do not play the interest 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.399
 me for a full review no 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.800
 I do not know if he's something like first impressions 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.719
 I just want to watch videos 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.280
 I had a desire for shorter reviews 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.309
 to try you have a game called 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.980
 spectra or spectral us the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.500
 standard july launcher announced 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.199
 after all, that has been fixed meanwhile 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.449
 a kind of endgame or end indeed with 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.699
 randomly generated levels and big ones 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.070
 focus on the music that explains well 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.930
 also the missing volume control he 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.700
 she is proud of his music 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:18.580
 according to bridge any key to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:31.420
 continue to rumble back 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:33.520
 ok back try the gameplay again 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.390
 quickly explained instead of a small one 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.430
 spaceship to the left and right collects 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.830
 meanwhile, one tries to do this 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.670
 avoid obstacles and not from 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.650
 the track to fall extra points there 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.690
 it brewster through when you get up close 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.580
 has crossed the obstacles by or 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.530
 if you leave shortly before the track without 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.880
 to overthrow 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.240
 Risky maneuvers are rewarded 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.040
 but not all that builds 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.050
 a combo on which only in one 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.380
 Collect break credited to the score 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.570
 becomes 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.330
 touches to an obstacle has become the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.340
 with the combo the control is at the beginning 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.869
 A little spongy than expected 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.850
 but within seconds 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 can get used to it and in no time 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.020
 always go well over the hand 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.990
 no wonder because there are two more 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.209
 actions and so you drive now the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.519
 stretch until either the music ends 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.790
 or you crash a bunch 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.800
 popups and then a rating 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.440
 a star turns a new stage 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.060
 free of these there are ten pieces and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.890
 they only differ 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.530
 in the degree of difficulty and in the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.300
 music choice every stage consists of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.130
 which stretch sections 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.890
 but they are arranged randomly 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.760
 repeat regularly 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.100
 visually changes between the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.040
 stage is nothing and playfully shares 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 at the later only more junk around the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.220
 Levels are no longer on the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 songs do not even adjust that 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.269
 occasional throb of the track 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.700
 takes place in time for the music and it was 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.580
 probably too hard at least that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.510
 color scheme vary 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.730
 theoretically I would only have one here 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.430
 can show only one level and you 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.840
 would not have noticed 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.420
 this is the soundtrack itself 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.709
 pretty good and fits the game first 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.830
 from the same person who already the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.209
 music has turned into super hexagon 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.519
 there is nothing I am outside of 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.560
 really would listen to it though 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.290
 fits and is quite varied 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.569
 unlike the game 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.540
 after ten minutes you have seen everything 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.069
 After ten levels everything experienced then gives 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.109
 it is a heavier and thereby 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.069
 slightly more interesting hardcore mode 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:41.200
 archive - and of course hot box who so 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.900
 his own highscore in levels 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.180
 always wants to beat it can do this 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.459
 who on international rankings 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500
 want to look good is this 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.470
 Do not do that, because there is something here 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.120
 Not 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.340
 spectra is a small and delicate game 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.159
 becomes a simple but functional 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.959
 play principle whether one likes that or it 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.730
 one too much to smartphone game 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.450
 reminds one everyone has for himself 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 knowledge 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.680
 it simply just does not offer enough 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.319
 I still really feel like it after 20 minutes 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.139
 entertain and for that the music one 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.479
 should be so important game element or 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.539
 that made me so much too little namely 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.470
 nothing especially since the album already has two 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.470
 years old 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.669
 i would like to play the game 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.800
 Still, it would not be recommendable 7 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.639
 euro 50 or with soundtrack 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.909
 12 eur 50 cost on the windows phone 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.570
 it costs only four euros 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.570
 a fair deal or 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.639
 Bonn
