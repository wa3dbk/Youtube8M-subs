00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:18.199
 and then people who spoke serenely that the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:20.400
 video where is man music the music 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.199
 music is very important to me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.779
 I guarantee that for many people too 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.279
 in fact not only for those who draw more 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 at least for me when I'm 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.340
 drawing I feel obliged to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.560
 listen to music 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.750
 I swear to you, I can not anymore. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 to draw without listening to music and everything 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 It depends on my mood if I'm sleepy. 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.079
 I do not like the picture and there it goes. 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.600
 and when I'm motivated I usually 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 listen to two songs that type 1 and animate 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.730
 enough is to continue drawing what is me 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.160
 I am the living tide of the ash tree and reborn 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 Glory these two songs have one thing 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.570
 that makes me very motivated maybe because 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.360
 cause of the letter is perhaps not because of the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 letter is I am the living tide is more or 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.609
 less so with trying to overturn what is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.489
 to see me grow up and sometimes kill me 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.119
 which predicts rebirth as a supernova 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.119
 that cross I am the living tide 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.210
 center will drown and be reborn from the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 glory is believing to dream to live 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 victory only depends on you believing 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 that may be your story is written by 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.530
 you and me listening to these two songs 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.530
 drawing there looks more or less like this 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.100
 from there 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 sat down to believe and even dream 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 declaration of all of you 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.870
 the ita said 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.870
 it's switzerland 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.660
 they are two songs that move a lot 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.520
 with myself and you're sure to be 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.800
 watching this video if you draw 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.320
 You must surely have a song that you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.490
 always listen, never stop listening 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.740
 because it makes you moody if it leaves you 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.840
 motivated makes you happy, there goes good 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.090
 my favorite style of music is this is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 a rock but I also like a pop 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 Do you know a called youtube channel? 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
 boy silvino so it's a youtube channel 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.280
 where they do covers they have the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.100
 own music too 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.440
 But I usually take it just like I do. 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.260
 saying and putting in their playlist 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.870
 lets run it even though it has a 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.530
 thing that I only listen to boys 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.720
 revealed when I'm tired or sleepy 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.860
 I do not know how to explain why but it's almost 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.810
 always like this 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.600
 beauty but what I mean is 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.240
 that sure depends on what you 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.580
 they listened to influence their design 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.410
 maybe if you're listening to a funk 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 or someone was counting a 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.000
 funk you do not wanting you can be 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 there not enjoying the music or you can 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.170
 to be enjoying the music more and giving 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 attention to music rather than to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.750
 Drawing and Finishing Your Drawing 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.959
 It starts to get bad and you're not there, it's 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.150
 100% with his head on it and it ends 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.510
 your drawing is getting crappy 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.580
 but ultimately influence something 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.220
 drawing and listening to music may not have 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.260
 nothing scientifically proven this is 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.510
 only one thing is mine, the less for me 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.040
 listening to music drawing influence 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.900
 the end result of a 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.660
 I draw my price and I feel more 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.480
 free I feel more comfortable drawing 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.310
 feeling more motivated by drawing and 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.980
 even if you had a drawing that did not have 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.070
 enjoying a lot and ending up with the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.040
 music I understand myself the most until I get to 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.420
 a result what kind i speak stayed 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.610
 better than before 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.500
 well this is for me but it would be in style 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.390
 music should listen maybe to you. 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.790
 listening to a rock can get in the way 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.590
 listen to a sertanejo you might like 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.109
 because it's a style you like 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.319
 me listening to pop rock is very important 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.549
 and it leaves me motivated to leave me 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.760
 It makes me want to draw more 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.620
 but if you listen to a sertanejo a funk that 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.209
 Are not styles that I like can 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.169
 Yes, even if you are 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.930
 I do not know 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.410
 luan santana and sock next type so 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.900
 Do you listen to the phone or without a phone? 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.970
 I usually listen to music without a phone is more 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.800
 depending on the time, I listen to the phone, right? 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.479
 Why can not you listen to loud music? 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.320
 always but for me i prefer a lot 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:42.599
 much more without a headset because I do not know 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.520
 explain but there's what you like about 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.380
 listen when you're doing something 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.860
 thing you like the saw throw away 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.419
 photos is to draw what in my case is 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.259
 Are you studying or reading a book? 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.449
 a lot of people listening to read book 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.070
 A song, I can not but to 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.789
 to draw I do so I do not know 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.800
 explain 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.870
 so I leave here in the comments to your 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.880
 music that you listen to if you 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.470
 disrupts listen to music also leaves 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.680

 the next day to day of a designer and 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.560
 said 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:52.259
