00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone today I come to solve one of 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.529
 the most frequent questions in ro blogs 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.900
 by people who speak Spanish like 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.809
 I get robox maybe you can only 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.080
 buy or you can also win it 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 unfortunately you can not beat it 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.430
 but you do not necessarily have to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.010
 buy there is something called trade currency 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 that saved everyone's ass first 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.550
 they go to catalog and then to train they run 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 yes 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 this is simple to use just leave it on 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.790
 tickets and you put the amount of tickets 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.129
 what do you want to give for the amount of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.320
 robots is like the exchange of the dollar 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.600
 and the weight sometimes the robot goes to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.640
 go up so much that 20 piques 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 they are robots when the normal thing is 10 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 tickets for 1 roux the minimum amount 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.140
 that can give in the train currency is 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.450
 20 tickets 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.489
 when you want to change robots for you 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.649
 you only change the tickets button by 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.690
 robots rocks are worth more than 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.579
 tickets but like the exchange 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 of dollar will give you less tickets of the 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.930
 you gave to the robots if I know that 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 listen horrible but you can also 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 profit but I'm afraid that in this 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 I will not teach you how to make a profit 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.930
 just to change tickets for robots 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.500
 look at this example and do exactly 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 what I do 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.730
 one of them 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.730
 yes 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.470
 so the currency train is used but 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.230
 surely they have to have many 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.230
 questions like what are the other buttons 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.239
