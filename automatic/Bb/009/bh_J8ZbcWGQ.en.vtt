of<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.720> second<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> dark

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
of a second it is dark

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.250 
of a second it is dark
there's<00:00:23.730> nothing<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.480> look<00:00:25.019> there's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there's nothing here look there's

nothing<00:00:25.380> here<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.369> dark<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.029> check

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
nothing here it's dark so let's check

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
nothing here it's dark so let's check
your<00:00:27.300> dynamic<00:00:27.689> range<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.410> was<00:00:28.619> taken<00:00:28.920> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
your dynamic range this was taken in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.080 
your dynamic range this was taken in
flat<00:00:29.279> profile<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> sticking<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.610> flat<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
flat profile so sticking in flat so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420 
flat profile so sticking in flat so
let's<00:00:33.270> turn<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> exposure<00:00:34.190> see<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.340> we

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
let's turn up the exposure see what we

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.049 
let's turn up the exposure see what we
could<00:00:35.579> pull<00:00:35.760> pull<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.829> image<00:00:38.070> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
could pull pull out of the image so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
could pull pull out of the image so
exposures<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.780> let's<00:00:40.770> pull<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
exposures up let's pull up on the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.450 
exposures up let's pull up on the
shadows<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> already<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.040> start<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> see

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
shadows and already we can start to see

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
shadows and already we can start to see
a<00:00:44.489> drastic<00:00:44.879> drastic<00:00:45.600> drastic<00:00:46.320> differences

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
a drastic drastic drastic differences

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
a drastic drastic drastic differences
pop<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> clarity<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:49.050> bit<00:00:49.170> this

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
pop on the clarity a little bit this

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
pop on the clarity a little bit this
hole<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.680> section<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> wall<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
hole here section here is a wall so you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
hole here section here is a wall so you
we're<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:51.930> gonna<00:00:52.140> get<00:00:52.620> anything<00:00:52.829> back<00:00:53.129> from

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
we're not gonna get anything back from

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
we're not gonna get anything back from
there<00:00:54.360> let's<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.170> poked<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
there let's see if we poked in the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
there let's see if we poked in the
contrast<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.460> pull<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
contrast a little bit pull down the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.250 
contrast a little bit pull down the
temperature<00:00:58.289> and<00:01:00.199> let's<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
temperature and let's go with to do a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
temperature and let's go with to do a
sharpen<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:06.080> lo<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> behold

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
sharpen it up a bit and lo and behold

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
sharpen it up a bit and lo and behold
with<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.970> calling<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.990> will<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with just those calling it will do the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.580 
with just those calling it will do the
profile<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.220> fine<00:01:11.840> lo<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.990> behold<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
profile that's fine lo and behold a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.999 
profile that's fine lo and behold a
couple<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.310> slider<00:01:14.760> strokes<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.650> dark

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
couple a slider strokes from that dark

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060 
couple a slider strokes from that dark
image<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> before<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
image so this is the before and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
image so this is the before and
obviously<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.450> extreme<00:01:21.869> extreme

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
obviously this is an extreme extreme

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.950 
obviously this is an extreme extreme
example<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> dynamic<00:01:24.299> range<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
example so this is the dynamic range of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.219 
example so this is the dynamic range of
the<00:01:25.020> nikon<00:01:25.439> d750<00:01:26.009> sensor<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.840> after

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the nikon d750 sensor this is the after

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.850 
the nikon d750 sensor this is the after
I<00:01:28.409> mean<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> look<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
I mean take a look at this this is a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.749 
I mean take a look at this this is a
drastic<00:01:31.860> drastic<00:01:33.049> drastic<00:01:34.159> situation<00:01:35.159> where

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
drastic drastic drastic situation where

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.039 
drastic drastic drastic situation where
I'm<00:01:36.150> gonna<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.540> noise<00:01:36.780> reduction

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I'm gonna do a little noise reduction

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.450 
I'm gonna do a little noise reduction
right<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.100> see<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
right here so I probably see that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
right here so I probably see that
adjusting<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> maybe<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> second<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
adjusting and maybe a second there you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.780 
adjusting and maybe a second there you
go<00:01:40.259> okay<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.100> noise<00:01:41.340> adjustments

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
go okay so that's noise adjustments

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.480 
go okay so that's noise adjustments
we'll<00:01:42.180> bring<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> back<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.560> mean<00:01:44.250> look<00:01:44.430> at

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we'll bring it back into I mean look at

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.289 
we'll bring it back into I mean look at
this<00:01:44.610> image<00:01:45.829> from<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.130> had<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.820> had<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this image from what we had we had this

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.149 
this image from what we had we had this
to<00:01:48.930> start<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.820> look<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.939> where<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.149> now<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
to start and look at where we are now so

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.590 
to start and look at where we are now so
obviously<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.280> an<00:01:53.460> extreme<00:01:53.790> example<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.420> prove

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
obviously is an extreme example to prove

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.130 
obviously is an extreme example to prove
a<00:01:54.720> point

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
a point

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.160 
a point
dynamic<00:01:55.979> range<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.369> phenomenal<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.719> nikon

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
dynamic range is phenomenal on the nikon

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
dynamic range is phenomenal on the nikon
d750<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.610> has<00:01:59.729> been<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> quick<00:02:00.149> hit<00:02:00.329> video

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
d750 so this has been a quick hit video

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.920
