help us brake pad you have if you look

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.410 
help us brake pad you have if you look
inside<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.830> rotor<00:01:06.830> is<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.460> first<00:01:07.760> little

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
inside the rotor is the first little

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.600 
inside the rotor is the first little
column<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.140> second<00:01:09.770> one<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:09.980> your<00:01:10.100> brake<00:01:10.370> pad

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
column the second one is your brake pad

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:21.210 
column the second one is your brake pad
which<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.940> right<00:01:11.120> here

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.000 

looks<00:01:22.220> about<00:01:22.490> five<00:01:22.790> millimeters<00:01:23.360> wide<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
looks about five millimeters wide so you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.500 
looks about five millimeters wide so you
won't<00:01:25.250> have<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.490> replace<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.180> but<00:01:26.300> we<00:01:26.390> will

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
won't have to replace it but we will

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.280 
won't have to replace it but we will
still<00:01:26.780> show<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.020> how<00:01:28.780> if<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.930> look<00:01:30.110> at<00:01:30.200> the

still show you how if you look at the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.850 
still show you how if you look at the
caliper<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:31.070> if<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.400> look<00:01:31.550> just<00:01:31.850> inside

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
caliper and if you look just inside

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.030 
caliper and if you look just inside
between<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.070> caliper<00:01:34.520> holder<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:36.530> rotor

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
between the caliper holder and the rotor

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.920 
between the caliper holder and the rotor
and<00:01:37.370> there<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.000> can<00:01:38.150> see<00:01:38.360> how<00:01:38.480> much<00:01:38.630> brake

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
and there you can see how much brake

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.880 
and there you can see how much brake
pads<00:01:39.200> left<00:01:39.470> if<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.340> see<00:01:40.580> this<00:01:41.180> is<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.890> caliper

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
pads left if you see this is the caliper

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.610 
pads left if you see this is the caliper
holder<00:01:43.370> this<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.940> rotor<00:01:44.150> right<00:01:45.020> here<00:01:45.470> are

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
holder this is the rotor right here are

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.280 
holder this is the rotor right here are
the<00:01:45.800> tip<00:01:46.010> my<00:01:46.190> screwdriver<00:01:46.550> is<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:48.110> thing

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
the tip my screwdriver is the thing

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.320 
the tip my screwdriver is the thing
that's<00:01:48.380> touching<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.830> rotor<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.060> your

that's touching the rotor this is your

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.330 
that's touching the rotor this is your
brake<00:01:50.510> pad

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.459 

you<00:01:55.939> see<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.240> still<00:01:56.390> have<00:01:56.450> four<00:01:57.229> or<00:01:57.320> five

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
you see we still have four or five

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.499 
you see we still have four or five
millimeters<00:01:58.159> left<00:01:58.369> if<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.939> have<00:01:59.149> less<00:01:59.479> than

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
millimeters left if you have less than

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.080 
millimeters left if you have less than
two<00:01:59.869> millimeters<00:02:00.109> of<00:02:00.560> breaking<00:02:01.070> brake<00:02:01.880> pad

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
two millimeters of breaking brake pad

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.050 
two millimeters of breaking brake pad
you<00:02:02.299> should<00:02:02.450> probably<00:02:03.429> replace<00:02:04.429> your<00:02:04.700> padding

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
you should probably replace your padding

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.230 
you should probably replace your padding
we<00:02:05.539> do<00:02:05.600> not<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.289> luckily<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:07.069> will<00:02:07.189> not<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.380 

you<00:02:12.240> want<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.510> take<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.960> 12<00:02:13.410> millimeter<00:02:13.830> wrench

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
you want to take a 12 millimeter wrench

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.620 
you want to take a 12 millimeter wrench
loosen<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.690> bolt<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.940> take<00:02:17.940> out<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> bank

loosen this bolt and take out the bank

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.050 
loosen this bolt and take out the bank
down<00:02:18.780> here

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.830 

this<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:28.030> slide<00:02:29.030> up<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.420> little<00:02:29.569> bit<00:02:29.720> of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
this will slide up with a little bit of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.620 
this will slide up with a little bit of
force<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:36.500> sure<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.890> aren't<00:02:37.390> pulling<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.510> this

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
force be sure you aren't pulling on this

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
course or this tube back here this will

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.300 
course or this tube back here this will
keep<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.880> tension<00:02:50.120> off<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:51.280> brake<00:02:52.280> fluid

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
keep the tension off the brake fluid

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:07.580 
keep the tension off the brake fluid
line

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.590 

I'm<00:03:08.590> pushing<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.280> Pistons<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.210> we<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.510> the
