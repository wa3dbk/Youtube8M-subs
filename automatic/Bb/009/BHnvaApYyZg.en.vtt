perform a vertical hit and when he
swings<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.469> a<00:01:16.770> diagonal

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
swings around it's actually a diagonal

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.690

shield<00:01:17.880> bash<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.810> hit<00:01:19.590> diagonally<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
shield bash so hit diagonally for that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.929 
shield bash so hit diagonally for that
at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.029> last<00:01:21.209> moment<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.189> when<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:23.310> steps<00:01:23.670> to

the<00:01:23.969> side<00:01:24.329> again<00:01:24.990> its<00:01:25.229> diagonal<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.249> that

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
the side again its diagonal with that

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.760 
the side again its diagonal with that
shield<00:01:26.819> bash<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:28.109> he<00:01:28.200> swings<00:01:28.529> the<00:01:28.679> other

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149 
shield bash and when he swings the other
way<00:01:29.099> it<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.969> another<00:01:30.539> diagonal<00:01:30.959> hit<00:01:31.709> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
way it is another diagonal hit the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.789 
way it is another diagonal hit the
opposite<00:01:32.669> direction<00:01:32.849> and<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:34.289> this<00:01:34.469> step

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
opposite direction and with this step

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.609 
opposite direction and with this step
back<00:01:35.069> it's<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.060> shield<00:01:36.329> bash<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:37.020> again<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
back it's a shield bash that again is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.029 
back it's a shield bash that again is
diagonal<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.999> the<00:01:39.090> first<00:01:39.389> hit<00:01:39.719> and<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.889> will

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
diagonal for the first hit and that will

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.819 
diagonal for the first hit and that will
give<00:01:41.069> you<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> break<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.029> when<00:01:42.929> he<00:01:43.109> lunges<00:01:43.349> at

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
give you a break and when he lunges at

you with the shield wait until he
actually<00:01:45.779> is<00:01:46.200> lunging<00:01:46.529> before<00:01:47.249> you<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
actually is lunging before you do the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
actually is lunging before you do the
vertical<00:01:47.939> hit<00:01:48.599> and<00:01:48.989> he<00:01:49.709> has<00:01:49.919> to<00:01:50.189> faint<00:01:50.579> moves

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
vertical hit and he has to faint moves

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.589 
vertical hit and he has to faint moves
where<00:01:51.270> he<00:01:51.419> moves<00:01:51.749> from<00:01:52.020> diagonal<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
where he moves from diagonal to

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.049 
where he moves from diagonal to
horizontal<00:01:54.599> from<00:01:55.109> both<00:01:55.349> down<00:01:55.709> and<00:01:56.039> up<00:01:56.549> so

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:57.059 
horizontal from both down and up so

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:59.059

them<00:02:06.130> one<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.609> have<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.820> wait<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> little

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
them one you have to wait a little

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.160 
them one you have to wait a little
longer<00:02:07.719> than<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.830> other<00:02:09.099> one<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.989> his

longer than the other one and with his
other<00:02:11.349> step<00:02:11.769> back<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.790> slight<00:02:13.360> diagonal

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
other step back it's a slight diagonal

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.940 
other step back it's a slight diagonal
hit<00:02:14.379> for<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.099> first<00:02:15.129> shield<00:02:16.030> bash<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.950> again

there's<00:02:21.250> four<00:02:21.310> days<00:02:21.819> on<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.209> tournament<00:02:22.870> so

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
there's four days on this tournament so

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.050 
there's four days on this tournament so
there's<00:02:23.260> plenty<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.739> time<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> few

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
there's plenty of time to have a few

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.619 
there's plenty of time to have a few
tries<00:02:25.420> at<00:02:25.810> this<00:02:25.870> stage<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:27.730> certainly<00:02:28.180> had

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
tries at this stage and I certainly had

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.430 
tries at this stage and I certainly had
a<00:02:28.900> few<00:02:29.290> goes<00:02:29.500> not<00:02:29.860> many<00:02:30.099> about<00:02:30.580> three<00:02:31.000> but<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.200> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
a few goes not many about three but if I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.220 
a few goes not many about three but if I
need<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.680> improve<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.400> score<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.330> will<00:02:34.629> by

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
need to improve the score then I will by

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190 
need to improve the score then I will by
practicing<00:02:35.650> some<00:02:36.310> more<00:02:36.549> but<00:02:37.330> at<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.629> point<00:02:37.930> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
practicing some more but at this point I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.650 
practicing some more but at this point I
have<00:02:38.459> 62<00:02:39.459> Perry's<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:41.709> put<00:02:42.040> me<00:02:42.220> at

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
have 62 Perry's and that's put me at

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.630 
have 62 Perry's and that's put me at
ninety-one<00:02:43.660> percent<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.650> I'm<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.459> leave

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
