the benefit of krill or over fish oil

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.010 
the benefit of krill or over fish oil
that's<00:00:47.000> what<00:00:47.149> I<00:00:47.210> really<00:00:47.480> want<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.690> go<00:00:47.780> over

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
that's what I really want to go over

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.319 
that's what I really want to go over
with<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:48.410> today<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.670> one<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:49.879> them<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.149> that

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
with you today so one of them is that

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.959 
with you today so one of them is that
the<00:00:50.480> EPA<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.050> DHA<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.219> much<00:00:52.670> better

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
the EPA and DHA is so much better

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.540 
the EPA and DHA is so much better
absorbed<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.620> know<00:00:54.710> figures<00:00:55.010> show<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.190> up

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
absorbed you know figures show that up

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.119 
absorbed you know figures show that up
to<00:00:55.850> 40<00:00:56.480> times<00:00:56.899> better<00:00:57.350> absorbed<00:00:57.800> than<00:00:57.800> fish

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
to 40 times better absorbed than fish

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.369 
to 40 times better absorbed than fish
oil<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.730> know<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.090> even<00:01:00.050> though<00:01:00.140> it's<00:01:00.230> more

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
oil you know so even though it's more

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.139 
oil you know so even though it's more
expensive<00:01:00.500> than<00:01:00.890> fish<00:01:01.100> oil<00:01:01.340> actually<00:01:01.940> in

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
expensive than fish oil actually in

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.929 
expensive than fish oil actually in
terms<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.449> utilization<00:01:03.410> it's<00:01:03.649> so<00:01:04.399> much<00:01:04.610> more

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
terms of utilization it's so much more

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.580 
terms of utilization it's so much more
cost<00:01:05.269> effective<00:01:05.810> because<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.290> giving

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
cost effective because it's just giving

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.350 
cost effective because it's just giving
it<00:01:06.619> in<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.979> form<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.340> your<00:01:07.520> body<00:01:07.670> can<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.270> much

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
it in a form that your body can so much

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.929 
it in a form that your body can so much
more<00:01:08.570> easily<00:01:08.780> use<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:10.220> this<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.400> because<00:01:10.850> it

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
more easily use now this is because it

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.840 
more easily use now this is because it
comes<00:01:11.450> with<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:12.380> substance<00:01:12.740> called<00:01:12.979> phospho

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
comes with a substance called phospho

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.170 
comes with a substance called phospho
lipids<00:01:14.049> phospholipids<00:01:15.049> are<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.310> also

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
lipids phospholipids are and also

acquired by the cells as our amiga fries
in<00:01:19.580> order<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.880> work<00:01:20.060> properly<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.659> a

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
in order to work properly it's a

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.260 
in order to work properly it's a
different<00:01:20.960> kind<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.229> fat<00:01:21.470> an<00:01:22.250> emulsifying<00:01:22.970> fat

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
different kind of fat an emulsifying fat

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.899 
different kind of fat an emulsifying fat
and<00:01:23.540> these<00:01:24.500> are<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:25.220> type<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.640> fat<00:01:25.759> which

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
and these are also a type of fat which

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.210 
and these are also a type of fat which
is<00:01:25.939> often<00:01:26.270> lacking<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.290> vegetarian<00:01:27.830> or

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
is often lacking in a vegetarian or

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.100 
is often lacking in a vegetarian or
vegan<00:01:28.250> diet<00:01:29.000> unless<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.540> re<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.659> lot<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.930> eggs

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
vegan diet unless you re a lot of eggs

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.560 
vegan diet unless you re a lot of eggs
so<00:01:30.710> that's<00:01:31.369> another<00:01:31.729> amazing<00:01:32.030> reason<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.450> have

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
so that's another amazing reason to have

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.940 
so that's another amazing reason to have
krill<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:32.960> especially<00:01:33.470> we<00:01:33.560> wanna<00:01:33.710> go<00:01:33.770> for<00:01:33.890> a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
krill is especially we wanna go for a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.530 
krill is especially we wanna go for a
vegan<00:01:34.340> diet<00:01:34.700> but<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.119> know<00:01:35.240> you're<00:01:35.360> not<00:01:35.479> a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
vegan diet but you know you're not a

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.030 
vegan diet but you know you're not a
hundred<00:01:35.720> percent<00:01:35.840> strict<00:01:36.320> about<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.560> then

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
hundred percent strict about it then

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.740 
hundred percent strict about it then
having<00:01:37.610> krill<00:01:37.850> oil<00:01:37.909> means<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.390> get<00:01:38.540> all

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
having krill oil means that you get all

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.510 
having krill oil means that you get all
those<00:01:39.079> especially<00:01:39.590> choline<00:01:40.189> which<00:01:40.220> is<00:01:40.460> a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
those especially choline which is a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.859 
those especially choline which is a
phospholipid<00:01:40.909> which<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.420> essential<00:01:41.840> for

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
phospholipid which is essential for

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.139 
phospholipid which is essential for
memory<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.399> brain<00:01:43.700> functioning

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
memory and the brain functioning

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.429 
memory and the brain functioning
properly<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:44.540> that's<00:01:44.689> another<00:01:44.990> reason<00:01:45.170> i<00:01:45.320> love

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
properly so that's another reason i love

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.620 
properly so that's another reason i love
krill<00:01:45.740> another<00:01:46.670> reason<00:01:47.000> i<00:01:47.060> really<00:01:47.479> love

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.600 
krill another reason i really love
krills<00:01:47.930> because<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.380> comes<00:01:48.649> with<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.920> natural

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
krills because it comes with a natural

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.050 
krills because it comes with a natural
antioxidant<00:01:50.509> called<00:01:50.810> astaxanthin

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
antioxidant called astaxanthin

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.490 
antioxidant called astaxanthin
astaxanthin<00:01:53.060> has<00:01:53.509> been<00:01:53.659> doing<00:01:53.869> again<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
astaxanthin has been doing again the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.260 
astaxanthin has been doing again the
rounds<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.860> lots<00:01:55.159> inhale<00:01:55.700> fold<00:01:55.939> recently

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
rounds and lots inhale fold recently

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.420 
rounds and lots inhale fold recently
because<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.840> amazing<00:01:57.680> benefits<00:01:58.040> which

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
because of the amazing benefits which

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.609 
because of the amazing benefits which
have<00:01:58.549> been<00:01:58.610> attributed<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.420> as<00:02:00.110> an<00:02:00.259> example

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
have been attributed to it as an example

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.440 
have been attributed to it as an example
one<00:02:00.890> of<00:02:00.920> them<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.219> that<00:02:01.369> if<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.640> go<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.000> self<00:02:02.329> up

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
one of them is that if you go to self up

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.389 
one of them is that if you go to self up
and<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.719> properly<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.860> pretty<00:02:04.310> much

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
and it properly it's pretty much

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.190 
and it properly it's pretty much
impossible<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:05.000> get<00:02:05.149> sunburn<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.659> know

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
impossible to get sunburn you know

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.719 
impossible to get sunburn you know
because<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.469> provides<00:02:06.829> just<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:07.310> layer<00:02:07.610> of

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
because it provides just this layer of

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.609 
because it provides just this layer of
protection<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:08.329> damaged<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.750> Sun<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.470> a

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
protection it's damaged the Sun it's a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.970 
protection it's damaged the Sun it's a
very<00:02:10.160> potent<00:02:10.970> antioxidant<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:12.739> do<00:02:12.920> we

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
very potent antioxidant so what do we

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.330 
very potent antioxidant so what do we
mean<00:02:13.190> by<00:02:13.220> antioxidant<00:02:13.940> well

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
mean by antioxidant well

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.449 
mean by antioxidant well
it<00:02:14.550> destroys<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.840> gets<00:02:16.200> rid<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> free

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
it destroys it gets rid of the free

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.699 
it destroys it gets rid of the free
radicals<00:02:18.120> which<00:02:18.390> otherwise<00:02:18.629> cause<00:02:18.989> havoc<00:02:19.530> in

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
radicals which otherwise cause havoc in

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.170 
radicals which otherwise cause havoc in
the<00:02:19.739> body<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.640> lead<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:20.879> premature

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the body and which can lead to premature

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.020 
the body and which can lead to premature
aging<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.140> obviously<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.099> really<00:02:23.459> important

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
aging so obviously a really important

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.790 
aging so obviously a really important
thing<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.690> diet<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.650> other

thing to have in your diet the other
thing<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.010> an<00:02:26.160> antioxidant<00:02:26.550> prevents<00:02:27.510> things

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
thing is an antioxidant prevents things

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.559 
thing is an antioxidant prevents things
from<00:02:28.019> oxidizing<00:02:29.010> now<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.060> one<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.480> the

from oxidizing now the one of the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.270 
from oxidizing now the one of the
problems<00:02:31.019> with<00:02:31.230> amiga<00:02:31.650> free<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.190> they

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
problems with amiga free is that they

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.690 
problems with amiga free is that they
oxidize<00:02:32.549> or<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:34.110> rancid<00:02:34.650> very<00:02:35.040> quickly<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
oxidize or go rancid very quickly and

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.940 
oxidize or go rancid very quickly and
you<00:02:36.480> know<00:02:36.599> without<00:02:36.750> labelling<00:02:37.349> anyone<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:37.860> of

you know without labelling anyone one of

the issues I have with fish oil or in

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
the issues I have with fish oil or in
fact<00:02:39.810> even<00:02:40.200> eating<00:02:40.530> fresh<00:02:40.739> fish<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
fact even eating fresh fish is that the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.759 
fact even eating fresh fish is that the
immediate<00:02:42.510> free<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.080> goes<00:02:43.290> off<00:02:43.500> really

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
immediate free in there goes off really

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.309 
immediate free in there goes off really
quickly<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:45.150> lot<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.480> time<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> amiga<00:02:46.110> free
