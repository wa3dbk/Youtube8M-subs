00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 you think the barbecue is just 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 for the meal we will show you that the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.540
 barbecue it can start soon 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.519
 the aperitif and that's the challenge that goes 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.359
 to meet in France we will make the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.300
 fat down we start with a marina of 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 the oil we get to that must be everything 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 simple it must be oil and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.279
 So you're in front of a barbecue 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:34.140
 so marinades that's just 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.980
 a notch of thyme we also have the laurels 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.079
 we will do the same 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.399
 just the case it's like that and after we 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 will put lemon we will crush 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.440
 just a little bit to give a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 little more wood our marinade 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.789
 there is almost just a pod 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.640
 garlic a knife have crushed and we 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.210
 do like the rest we crumbs in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.550
 the marinade 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.619
 we will now take care of our tongs 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.200
 crab or cake is summer 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.930
 it's the peak season of tongs it's 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.250
 also the high season for a drink what 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.530
 what we will do to them we just want them 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.070
 case it is for the sauce to return to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.680
 interior 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170
 the first the back of all high and you 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.460
 beat on 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.500
 here it is necessary just the cases it is false 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.409
 no more than that you will take 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.939
 the other piece 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.080
 and if you do not find claws 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.579
 crab you can use the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.829
 langoustines like that in 20 years that you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.880
 will avoid this little game of breaking the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.200
 pliers or drop them in the marina and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 you 're going to mix a little bit of it all just 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.780
 for that flavors and goes up to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.250
 inside expenses 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.200
 while our marine crab claws 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.600
 we're going to make a little gourmet butter 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.630
 to add at the same time that we have 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.060
 simple butter again from 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 Lemon is a little sauce pleasure 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.350
 so do not get too attached to 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.950
 quantities does what makes you want 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:16.480
 with this title of ingredients a little bit 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.480
 of them is a little bit of garlic 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:34.430
 we do generous on piercing then 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.970
 we crush a little bit of salt a little 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.980
 little spice 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.599
 we'll take care of the crab claws he 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.620
 just have to warm the flesh of 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.799
 crab is on the run 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.099
 we must not insist too much and we are 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.349
 party for about 3 to 5 minutes is the 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.370
 just leave like this 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.900
 the crab claws are hot 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.420
 we apply to remove them from the barbecue 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.190
 in the breaks nicely on the plate and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.480
 we will give them even more taste 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.099
 with our little butter all perfumed good 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.170
 giving to add on by 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.849
 to go generously it's now 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.920
 proved we can barbecue with my 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.239
 life in France from the aperitif and now 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.130
 you just have to burn your 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.329
 fingers and called friends to eat 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.329
 this well- scented crab
