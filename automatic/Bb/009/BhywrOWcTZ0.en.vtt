of them and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.020 
of them and
it<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.490> I've<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.910> them

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the same price they've gone up enough

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.720
