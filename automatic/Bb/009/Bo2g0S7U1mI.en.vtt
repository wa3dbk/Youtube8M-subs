acronym for something else right so like
an<00:00:13.710> SCV<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.849> probably<00:00:15.030> sonic

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
an SCV be so it's probably sonic

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
an SCV be so it's probably sonic
electronix<00:00:15.750> something<00:00:16.529> else<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.490> is

pumped<00:01:51.170> about<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.590> lot<00:01:51.950> lately<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.430> brothers

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
pumped about a lot lately is brothers

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:02.500 
pumped about a lot lately is brothers
marks<00:02:01.000> so<00:02:02.000> we're<00:02:02.180> going<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.360> make<00:02:02.450> some

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
marks so we're going to make some

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.450 
marks so we're going to make some
announcements<00:02:02.930> at<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> community<00:02:03.800> day<00:02:04.190> but<00:02:04.430> I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
announcements at a community day but I

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.490 
announcements at a community day but I
wanted<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.820> make<00:02:05.060> one<00:02:05.450> announcement<00:02:05.870> here<00:02:06.260> and
