00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 What is Adaptil? 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.760
 What is Adaptil? 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.740
 Adaptil is a copy of a natural pheromone that excludes a bitch 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 a few days after giving birth to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650
 the puppies calmed down, felt comfortable 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.560
 and made them feel safe. 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.570
 What is a pheromone? 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900
 Pheromones are messages that a dog leaves to itself or other dogs. 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.510
 You can't see or feel the pheromone 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.690
 and only animals of the same species can recognize it. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.340
 Ceva was the first company to develop pheromones 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.600
 as a way of improving animal behavior. 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.340
 For example, Adaptil can be used not only to provide comfort for puppies, 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.140
 just as a natural pheromone would act, 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.360
 but can also be used to ensure the comfort of adult dogs in new or stressful situations, 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.440
 as during a car trip when the dog is exposed to loud and spooky sounds or when traveling to a vet. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 Adaptil has been shown to reduce or eliminate completely 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.970
 adverse behavior in dogs in these situations. 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.710
 Based on research with Adaptil Ceva has developed several effective ways 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830
 application for adult dogs and puppies. 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.830
 They are Adaptil spray, 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040
 Adaptil diffuser, Adaptil collar (and in some countries also Adaptil napkins). 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.740
 Each application form has its benefits 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.780
 which meet the specific requirements of dogs. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.120
 For example, the Adaptil collar is great for dogs that are rarely home 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.760
 and who are rather out without their owner. 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.730
 Because the collar works for 4 weeks 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.630
 Does Your Dog Adaptil Pheromones Continuously 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.490
 throughout the day within a given period. 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.390
 Adaptil diffuser is perfect for use in the house 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.100
 and is especially useful for your dog if he needs to feel more secure at home 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800
 or if you have more than one dog. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.490
 Use is simple 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.830
 just plug it in and let it work 24 hours a day 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.230
 seven days a week. 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.730
 The pheromone filling lasts one month 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.149
 and then just replace it. 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.749
 It is advisable to replace the entire Adaptil diffuser after six months of use 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.360
 or when you used five cartridges. 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.060
 Adaptil spray is very useful if you need to 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.340
 support Adaptil for a short time. 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.370
 You can use the spray in your car when you go on a trip 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.080
 or spray your dog's blanket or bed. 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.549
 Because Adaptil is an alcohol-based spray, it's a good idea not to let go 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.390
 that you have treated with spray 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.539
 dog for 15 minutes. 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.920
 Dogs do not like the smell of alcohol. 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.370
 It is therefore very important that you never spray the spray directly on your dog. 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.069
 Adaptil is also available as a napkin in some countries. 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.370
 Simply wipe the area you want to treat. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.080
 All these products can be used simultaneously for additional support 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.000
 if you wish. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.600
 The dog cannot overdose pheromones.
