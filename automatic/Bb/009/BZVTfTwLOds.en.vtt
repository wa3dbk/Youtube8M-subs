now<00:02:58.090> whether<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:58.810> build<00:02:59.080> your<00:02:59.230> own<00:02:59.320> like

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
now whether you can build your own like

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.470 
now whether you can build your own like
an<00:02:59.770> arma<00:03:00.070> 3<00:03:00.310> epoch<00:03:00.760> where<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.270> simply

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
an arma 3 epoch where you can simply

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.690 
an arma 3 epoch where you can simply
take<00:03:01.870> over<00:03:02.200> an<00:03:02.290> apartment<00:03:02.770> building<00:03:03.070> either

would<00:03:04.030> be<00:03:04.090> fine<00:03:04.240> with<00:03:04.510> me<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:05.050> would<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.320> pretty

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
would be fine with me it would be pretty

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.960 
punch and actually access your stuff and
the<00:03:23.680> one<00:03:23.830> reason<00:03:23.980> i<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.490> system<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
the one reason i like this system is

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.400 
the one reason i like this system is
because<00:03:25.270> all<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.450> your<00:03:25.690> stuff<00:03:25.930> would<00:03:26.260> be

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
because all of your stuff would be

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.620 
because all of your stuff would be
protected<00:03:26.620> inside<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:28.150> given<00:03:28.450> somebody

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
protected inside now given somebody

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.510 
protected inside now given somebody
guesses<00:03:29.170> your<00:03:29.350> password<00:03:29.830> correctly<00:03:30.010> you're

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
guesses your password correctly you're

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.190 
guesses your password correctly you're
shit<00:03:30.760> out<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.880> luck<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.810> don't<00:03:31.900> make<00:03:32.050> your

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
shit out of luck just don't make your

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720 
shit out of luck just don't make your
password<00:03:32.770> your<00:03:32.890> birth<00:03:33.130> year<00:03:33.459> or<00:03:33.580> something

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
password your birth year or something

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.300 
password your birth year or something
stupid<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.510> you'll<00:03:34.989> be<00:03:35.170> fine<00:03:35.530> so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
stupid like that you'll be fine so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.860 
stupid like that you'll be fine so
basically<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.970> building<00:03:37.390> would<00:03:37.570> be<00:03:37.630> your

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
basically this building would be your

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.870 
basically this building would be your
safe<00:03:38.170> haven<00:03:38.530> from<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.830> outside<00:03:39.250> world<00:03:39.520> where

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
safe haven from the outside world where

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.490 
safe haven from the outside world where
you<00:03:39.940> could<00:03:40.060> store<00:03:40.239> weapons<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.989> trade<00:03:41.260> in<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
you could store weapons to trade in the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.140 
you could store weapons to trade in the
trading<00:03:41.770> post<00:03:41.890> which<00:03:42.459> trading<00:03:42.850> posts<00:03:43.090> are

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
trading post which trading posts are

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.820 
trading post which trading posts are
actually<00:03:43.450> confirmed<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.470> game<00:03:44.680> by

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
actually confirmed to be in the game by

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.620 
actually confirmed to be in the game by
the<00:03:44.860> way<00:03:44.980> which<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.670> pretty<00:03:45.910> awesome<00:03:46.030> and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
the way which is pretty awesome and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.090 
the way which is pretty awesome and
another<00:03:46.840> reason<00:03:47.050> i<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.620> safe<00:03:47.890> haven

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
another reason i like the safe haven

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.890 
another reason i like the safe haven
system<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:49.030> because<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.510> can<00:03:49.660> give<00:03:49.780> your

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
system is because you can give your

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.080 
system is because you can give your
four-digit<00:03:50.560> pin<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:51.100> your<00:03:51.280> group<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.640> friends

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
four-digit pin to your group of friends

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.120 
four-digit pin to your group of friends
so<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.390> person<00:03:52.900> who<00:03:52.989> made<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.320> haven<00:03:53.620> doesn't

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
so the person who made the haven doesn't

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.740 
so the person who made the haven doesn't
always<00:03:54.520> have<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:54.790> online<00:03:55.060> if<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.510> want<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
always have to be online if you want to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.750 
always have to be online if you want to
go<00:03:55.810> inside<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.350> it<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:56.650> all<00:03:56.890> around<00:03:57.190> i<00:03:57.370> think<00:03:57.670> it

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
go inside of it so all around i think it

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.400 
go inside of it so all around i think it
is<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.910> pretty<00:03:58.300> neat<00:03:58.510> idea<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.080> incorporate

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
is a pretty neat idea to incorporate

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.380 
is a pretty neat idea to incorporate
something<00:04:00.010> along<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.489> lines<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:01.000> into

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
something along the lines of this into

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.020 
something along the lines of this into
the<00:04:01.510> game<00:04:01.690> as<00:04:02.050> for<00:04:02.950> scavenging<00:04:03.610> we<00:04:03.790> already

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the game as for scavenging we already

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.370 
the game as for scavenging we already
know<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.510> find<00:04:04.780> some<00:04:04.959> really<00:04:05.260> good

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
know that you can find some really good

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.620 
know that you can find some really good
weapons<00:04:05.770> after<00:04:06.010> defeating<00:04:06.520> AI<00:04:06.850> enemies<00:04:07.180> in

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
weapons after defeating AI enemies in

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.570 
weapons after defeating AI enemies in
certain<00:04:08.050> areas<00:04:08.260> or<00:04:08.680> at<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.830> end<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.130> missions

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
certain areas or at the end of missions

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.740 
certain areas or at the end of missions
and<00:04:09.910> while<00:04:10.030> there<00:04:10.150> isn't<00:04:10.450> actually<00:04:10.540> a

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
and while there isn't actually a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.479 
and while there isn't actually a
currency<00:04:11.350> system<00:04:11.709> put<00:04:11.950> into<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.340> game

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
currency system put into the game

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.180 
currency system put into the game
considering<00:04:13.300> money<00:04:13.570> is<00:04:13.750> useless<00:04:14.230> i<00:04:14.470> think

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
considering money is useless i think

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.070 
considering money is useless i think
trading<00:04:15.489> posts<00:04:15.910> are<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.570> huge

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
trading posts are going to be a huge

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.750 
trading posts are going to be a huge
part<00:04:17.380> of<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.770> game<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.220> would<00:04:18.340> be<00:04:18.489> kind<00:04:18.700> of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
part of the game it would be kind of

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.400 
part of the game it would be kind of
cool<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.299> could<00:04:19.480> overrun<00:04:20.020> them<00:04:20.230> by

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
cool if you could overrun them by

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.380 
cool if you could overrun them by
defeating<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.070> AI<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.790> will<00:04:21.910> most<00:04:22.150> likely

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
defeating the AI that will most likely

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.930 
defeating the AI that will most likely
be<00:04:22.600> placed<00:04:23.050> there<00:04:23.320> now<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.370> other<00:04:24.520> hand<00:04:24.730> I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
be placed there now on the other hand I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.220 
be placed there now on the other hand I
think<00:04:25.180> these<00:04:25.270> are<00:04:25.330> going<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.720> be<00:04:25.810> friendly

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
think these are going to be friendly

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.870 
think these are going to be friendly
zones<00:04:26.560> scattered<00:04:27.100> around<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.460> map<00:04:27.640> that

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
zones scattered around the map that

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.460 
zones scattered around the map that
won't<00:04:28.060> allow<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.540> shoot<00:04:28.720> your<00:04:28.780> weapon<00:04:29.080> I

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
won't allow you to shoot your weapon I

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.600 
won't allow you to shoot your weapon I
guess<00:04:29.710> we'll<00:04:29.890> just<00:04:29.919> have<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.310> wait<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.460> see

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
guess we'll just have to wait and see

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.760 
guess we'll just have to wait and see
about<00:04:30.850> these<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:31.870> am<00:04:32.050> hoping<00:04:32.440> you<00:04:32.470> can

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
about these but I am hoping you can

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.010 
about these but I am hoping you can
overrun<00:04:33.340> them<00:04:33.550> by<00:04:33.729> killing<00:04:34.180> all<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.450> AI<00:04:34.600> and

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
overrun them by killing all the AI and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.510 
overrun them by killing all the AI and
then<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.200> can<00:04:35.350> go<00:04:35.440> steal<00:04:35.740> some<00:04:35.950> good<00:04:36.130> weapons

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
then you can go steal some good weapons

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.580 
then you can go steal some good weapons
then<00:04:37.210> after<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> certain<00:04:37.840> amount<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.169> time<00:04:38.380> they

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
then after a certain amount of time they

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.879 
then after a certain amount of time they
will

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
will

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.129 
will

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139

reopened now this does kind of bring up
some<00:04:41.349> concerns<00:04:41.830> though<00:04:42.159> if<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.490> could<00:04:42.699> just

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
some concerns though if you could just

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.029 
some concerns though if you could just
kill<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> AI<00:04:43.389> for<00:04:43.840> easy<00:04:44.020> weapons<00:04:44.560> why<00:04:44.830> would

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
kill the AI for easy weapons why would

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.529 
kill the AI for easy weapons why would
you<00:04:45.129> even<00:04:45.249> go<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:45.610> trade<00:04:46.030> here<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.419> that's

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
you even go to trade here and that's

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.330 
you even go to trade here and that's
where<00:04:46.749> I<00:04:46.780> think<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.169> idea<00:04:47.349> could<00:04:47.860> go<00:04:48.069> wrong

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
where I think this idea could go wrong

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.939 
where I think this idea could go wrong
it's<00:04:49.029> a<00:04:49.180> cool<00:04:49.419> concept<00:04:49.749> in<00:04:50.139> my<00:04:50.259> opinion<00:04:50.529> but<00:04:50.710> I

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
it's a cool concept in my opinion but I

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.980 
it's a cool concept in my opinion but I
just<00:04:51.249> don't<00:04:51.430> know<00:04:51.639> how<00:04:51.879> it<00:04:52.060> would<00:04:52.240> be<00:04:52.270> balanced

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
just don't know how it would be balanced

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.629 
just don't know how it would be balanced
so<00:04:53.259> you're<00:04:53.409> not<00:04:53.529> just<00:04:53.590> raiding<00:04:54.159> the<00:04:54.279> trading

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
so you're not just raiding the trading

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.610 
so you're not just raiding the trading

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
still no confirmed a list of weapons but

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.420 
still no confirmed a list of weapons but
considering<00:04:59.319> this<00:04:59.439> game<00:04:59.650> is<00:04:59.830> based<00:05:00.069> in<00:05:00.279> an

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
considering this game is based in an

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.339 
considering this game is based in an
urban<00:05:00.610> environment<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.449> don't<00:05:01.870> think<00:05:01.990> we're

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
urban environment I don't think we're

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.529 
urban environment I don't think we're
going<00:05:02.469> to<00:05:02.620> see<00:05:02.650> 50<00:05:03.219> Cal<00:05:03.430> snipers<00:05:03.969> or<00:05:04.120> anything

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
going to see 50 Cal snipers or anything

going to see 50 Cal snipers or anything

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
to that extreme it just wouldn't make

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.189 
to that extreme it just wouldn't make
any<00:05:06.789> sense<00:05:07.060> in<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.389> setting<00:05:07.689> of<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.870> game

any sense in the setting of the game

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.439 
any sense in the setting of the game
definitely<00:05:08.830> expect<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.279> see<00:05:09.430> DMR's<00:05:10.029> assault

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449
