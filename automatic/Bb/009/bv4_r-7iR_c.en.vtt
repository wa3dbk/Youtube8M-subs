00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.030
 not I want to be in the system 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.679
 that's what the foundation says 3 9 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
 3 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
 3 that's a can say you know 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.529
 it presses 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.679
 perhaps the nicest thing is that our last word told this 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.079
 most important things to do 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.969
 a word sun people there was a word it is absolutely not allowed to say anything 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.490
 is 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 your mom 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 you have to be for nothing 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540
 let me just think there is not enough 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.970
 the fall 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.580
 say that last year 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.630
 life 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.800
 young orange but now I pretty he walked to it at about ten o'clock in it 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.250
 Dutch record that is according to insiders around the world 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.040
 this as far as software 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 I'm enjoying 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 6 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.590
 8 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.460
 only four hits 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.630
 the squad but once again a good look that we come a good because also the PVV 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 so 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.400
 for instance 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.189
 it's about being included in the economy the protest at all 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.240
 just 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.409
 with the cap around 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.409
 yes sorry the court i have work 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.010
 in its own words 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.670
 I think this is of course up to date 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 but 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.809
 it does too 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.630
 I didn't want to see me 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.860
 after five themes in the newspaper it says that the prices are all about walter 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 where she among other things the albert heijn is stolen the one who finds this tape is it 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.449
 odd actually that I put on many lessons 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.449
 I don't understand why we have to find these cities 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.849
 8 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.259
 I would rather have won 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.519
 ps3 during a public tender 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.519
 I fled on foot 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.569
 the terrorists 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 it is not obvious 6 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.459
 not the dog 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.909
 I think that is 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.639
 73 the disease has stabbed a million people 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.749
 the Spaniards for world history 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:02.740
 because 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.209
 cyrus 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 That
