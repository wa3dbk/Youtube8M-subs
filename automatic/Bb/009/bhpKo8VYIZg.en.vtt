00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.270 
community here on YouTube I think that
all<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.900> chokers<00:02:13.380> are<00:02:13.800> like<00:02:13.950> very

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
all the chokers are like very

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.920 
all the chokers are like very
experiences<00:02:15.150> tough<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.569> they<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:15.780> what

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
experiences tough and they know what

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.080 
experiences tough and they know what
they're<00:02:16.110> doing<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.940> good

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
they're doing and I think it's good

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.850 
they're doing and I think it's good
because<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.360> lot<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> people<00:02:18.690> like<00:02:19.110> videos<00:02:19.560> like
