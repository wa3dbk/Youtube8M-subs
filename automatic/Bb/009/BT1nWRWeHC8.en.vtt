00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.170
 now the situation is the following i want 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 bring into this drawing in which 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.099
 Sighted another drawing is very simple 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 command to do this the command of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.580
 insert uncertainty 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.230
 I can dictate the keyboard and normally 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.500
 choose the file then choose the one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.779
 four - burner stove when I chose only 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.320
 have one cancel until the next in that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.430
 realistic oxy list I have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.690
 my drawing 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.940
 the cooker block is not available 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.370
 because it was not created here has never been 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 used here 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 the first time I'm going to insert block 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.690
 I can come here and find his file. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 the drawing I can not put it there 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 from that moment the block becomes 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.190
 be present on this list 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.280
 and then I can use it, I'm not going 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.229
 select and then it turns a normal block 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 I can not specify the point of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.820
 all the same 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.430
 the doc block friend point to be his alone 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.619
 Is there a written block I can do this? 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.759
 with any other design can by 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.670
 example grab a level copy there 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.080
 I bring my drawing from any position I 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.860
 I can then use any of these 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.290
 blocks 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 The idea is that when you have a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.630
 block you notice for example the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.710
 blocks will always be used in all 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.299
 the projects 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 It is interesting to have to use in any 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.579
 design a way for you to save 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.399
 this block is you cut a piece 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.710
 save his file only using the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.430
 command as I showed in the video 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.530
 previous 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.149
 and then when you want to use you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.780
 follow this command that I am 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.719
 showing here only one observation 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.869
 when you bring a drawing in 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.060
 of your project 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.140
 that drawing will bring all the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.050
 lakers that were used to create 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.630
 so if for example this stove if it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.820
 was designed on the so-called stove 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.830
 when you insert the holler block comes 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.540
 end is stove 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 this symbol here if it was 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.750
 originally designed in the 10th loggia and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 You trimmed threw it out 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.820
 he went along the definition law went along 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.010
 So when you bring this to 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.090
 inside 11 drawing that read that was 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.330
 used 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.910
 It comes with one so I recommend that you 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.820
 organize the blocks that you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.010
 create in a way that you do not 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.210
 creating laws with different names or 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 kind of thing 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.620
 another strategy is you place 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.550
 any blocks you create 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.380
 all of them always in law 016 neutral all 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.560
 the drawing has and so when you 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.360
 insert it will adapt when reading in that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.820
 you insert that sometimes you want 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.670
 working read symbology insert this 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.740
 here it will come falling law symbology 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.220
 stay in the color you have to read and everything 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.760
 more 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.950
 if he is read he was not 60 he 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.380
 will bring himself to read from him to his 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.270
 drawing is very simple you use a 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.020
 draw a drawing into 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.350
 other 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.630
 including this command the right command 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.270
 It works for other drawings if you want. 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.990
 bring any design you do not 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.730
 generated by the command w you 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.130
 can bring about bringing a project 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.910
 all here inside and start 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.710
 to work 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.530
 What difference is the difference? 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.440
 project that you bring you do not define a 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.910
 right master base point defined by that 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.070
 example in the case of the stove 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.080
 when the first time deputy ok then 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.600
 this point- to-point base on the stove is 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.600
 dragged by that base point in the case 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.490
 here at the cup and level, and this is 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.709
 the low level quota 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.959
 in the case of the project that has not been 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.420
 treated before you recorded block 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.070
 reverse this problem it will not have 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.140
 a base point then the drawing may be 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.300
 here as the basis of the fully attack 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.600
 from the drawing generates some 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.600
 confusions
