called<00:02:13.090> calibre<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.470> see<00:02:14.650> any<00:02:14.770> accents

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
called calibre I don't see any accents

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
called calibre I don't see any accents
here<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> assume<00:02:16.360> that's<00:02:16.570> how

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
here so I assume that's how

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.420 
here so I assume that's how
say<00:02:17.170> caliber<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:18.790> free<00:02:19.530> since<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.680> version

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
say caliber and is free since on version

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
say caliber and is free since on version
zero<00:02:21.819> point<00:02:22.060> six<00:02:22.450> point<00:02:22.870> five<00:02:23.769> point<00:02:24.099> one<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
zero point six point five point one and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.800 
zero point six point five point one and
what<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.349> when<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.220> opens<00:02:27.640> looks<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.569> this

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
what it when it opens looks like this

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.520 
what it when it opens looks like this
and<00:02:29.049> it's<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> library<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.930> iBooks

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and it's kind of the library for iBooks

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
and it's kind of the library for iBooks
but<00:02:33.159> not<00:02:33.390> not<00:02:34.390> only<00:02:34.569> does<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.079> let<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> read

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
but not not only does it let you read

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.699 
but not not only does it let you read
iBooks<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.299> even<00:02:37.450> send<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> devices<00:02:38.470> it

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
iBooks you can even send it devices it

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.789 
iBooks you can even send it devices it
actually<00:02:39.069> has<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.430> lot<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.879> options<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.230> what

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
actually has a lot of options but what

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.920 
actually has a lot of options but what
I'm<00:02:41.920> interested<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.489> here<00:02:42.549> is<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.269> reading

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
I'm interested in here is just reading

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.440 
I'm interested in here is just reading
an<00:02:44.019> iBook<00:02:44.409> so<00:02:44.680> say<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.099> have<00:02:45.670> an<00:02:45.819> ePub<00:02:46.209> format

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
an iBook so say I have an ePub format

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.990 
an iBook so say I have an ePub format
and<00:02:46.959> Frankenstein<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.400> want<00:02:48.609> to<00:02:48.670> view<00:02:48.849> it

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
and Frankenstein and I want to view it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.410 
and Frankenstein and I want to view it
so<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.629> you<00:02:49.720> do<00:02:49.840> first<00:02:50.590> few<00:02:51.060> after<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.150> drag

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
so all you do first few after you drag

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.920 
so all you do first few after you drag
it<00:02:52.659> into<00:02:52.840> here<00:02:53.670> it'll<00:02:54.670> be<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.329> library

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
it into here it'll be in the library

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.149 
it into here it'll be in the library
so<00:02:57.150> here's<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> size<00:02:58.750> author<00:02:59.200> title<00:02:59.769> date

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
so here's as a size author title date

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.780 
so here's as a size author title date
and<00:03:00.900> here<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.019> go<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.889> it's<00:03:03.159> opening<00:03:03.519> up<00:03:03.639> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
and here we go so it's opening up the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.589 
and here we go so it's opening up the
viewer<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.659> lots<00:03:05.109> of<00:03:05.230> options<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:07.000> here<00:03:07.480> it

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
viewer and lots of options so here it

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.089 
viewer and lots of options so here it
starts<00:03:07.989> up<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.939> can<00:03:09.939> even<00:03:10.090> large<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:11.099> think

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
starts up and can even large it think

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.250 
starts up and can even large it think
yeah<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.639> can<00:03:12.819> even<00:03:12.939> go<00:03:13.120> fullscreen<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:14.109> is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
yeah you can even go fullscreen this is

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.890 
yeah you can even go fullscreen this is
full<00:03:14.500> screen<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:16.000> change<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.599> font

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
full screen and you can change the font

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.830 
full screen and you can change the font
size<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.799> think<00:03:18.069> oh<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.609> too<00:03:18.879> small<00:03:19.599> I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
size so you think oh this is too small I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.270 
size so you think oh this is too small I
want<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.260> make<00:03:20.409> it<00:03:20.530> bigger<00:03:21.569> go<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:27.129> can

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
want to make it bigger go and you can

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.220 
want to make it bigger go and you can
start<00:03:27.579> reading<00:03:27.760> Frankenstein<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.900> even

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
start reading Frankenstein and it even

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.979 
start reading Frankenstein and it even
bookmarks<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.099> so<00:03:30.699> next<00:03:31.299> time<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.629> open<00:03:31.660> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
bookmarks it so next time you open the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.110 
bookmarks it so next time you open the
book<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.530> will<00:03:32.980> go<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.639> part<00:03:33.879> where<00:03:34.030> you

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
book it will go to the part where you

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.490 
book it will go to the part where you
left<00:03:34.359> off<00:03:34.569> so<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:35.109> example<00:03:35.620> say<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.400> was<00:03:37.030> at

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
left off so for example say I was at

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.990 
left off so for example say I was at
letter<00:03:38.500> 4<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.129> then<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.549> take<00:03:39.760> sit<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.120> out<00:03:40.709> see

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
letter 4 and then I take sit it out see

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.490 
letter 4 and then I take sit it out see
it<00:03:43.000> again<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.340> exit<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:48.780> somehow<00:03:49.780> exit<00:03:50.379> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
it again and exit and somehow exit the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.520 
it again and exit and somehow exit the
whole<00:03:50.680> application<00:03:54.930> yes<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.169> can

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
whole application yes you can

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.020 
whole application yes you can
I<00:03:56.560> didn't<00:03:57.010> show<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:57.159> this<00:03:57.340> before<00:03:57.489> but<00:03:57.879> it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
I didn't show you this before but it

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.149 
I didn't show you this before but it
does<00:03:58.239> take<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.540> while<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:59.109> start<00:03:59.169> up<00:03:59.620> because<00:04:00.010> I

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
does take a while to start up because I

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.969 
does take a while to start up because I
think<00:04:00.220> it's<00:04:00.699> more<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.780> universal<00:04:02.409> app<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.919> it

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
think it's more of a universal app so it

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.449 
think it's more of a universal app so it
might<00:04:03.099> work<00:04:03.280> on<00:04:03.459> PCs<00:04:04.030> as<00:04:04.239> well<00:04:04.419> so<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
might work on PCs as well so the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.939 
might work on PCs as well so the
interface<00:04:06.459> isn't<00:04:06.760> exactly<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.569> best<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.709> go

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
interface isn't exactly the best so I go

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.740 
interface isn't exactly the best so I go
here<00:04:09.220> view<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:11.729> yet<00:04:12.729> the<00:04:12.940> view<00:04:13.090> also<00:04:13.389> takes<00:04:13.599> a

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
here view and yet the view also takes a

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.800 
here view and yet the view also takes a
pitch<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.109> to<00:04:14.979> start<00:04:15.280> up<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:16.169> it's<00:04:17.169> loading

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
pitch is to start up and it's loading

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.910 
pitch is to start up and it's loading
and<00:04:19.810> here<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:20.199> go<00:04:20.349> later<00:04:20.799> for

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.550 

yeah<00:04:26.920> letter<00:04:27.190> for<00:04:27.520> here<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.790> are<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:29.230> this<00:04:29.410> is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
yeah letter for here we are so this is

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.250 
yeah letter for here we are so this is
one<00:04:29.710> example<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.900> alternatives<00:04:31.900> that<00:04:32.050> I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
one example but alternatives that I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.740 
one example but alternatives that I
personally<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.190> better<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.480> beta

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
personally like better but it's in beta

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.650 
personally like better but it's in beta
right<00:04:34.900> now<00:04:35.110> show<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:35.890> before<00:04:36.130> it's<00:04:36.430> called

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
right now show you before it's called

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.600 
right now show you before it's called
stanza<00:04:37.660> now<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.320> think<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:38.890> is<00:04:39.100> on<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.430> iPhone

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
stanza now I think this is on the iPhone

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.930 
stanza now I think this is on the iPhone
iPhone<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:41.020> iPod<00:04:41.350> Touch<00:04:41.650> before<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:42.670> think

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
