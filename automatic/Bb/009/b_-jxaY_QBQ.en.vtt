00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 yes hello dear 1000 best woman to see 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 the 1000 base editorial here today 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.350
 fully represented 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.989
 around the current journey through the year 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.600
 2013 really spurs on 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.720
 now we have the aprilia 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.460
 kapoor 200 made motorcycle the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.100
 virtually with the predecessor only the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 Names in common has completely new device 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 also presented as the other 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.390
 now already stuffed with high 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 tech on all corners and ends 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.850
 traction control abs also above the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.039
 fork handles you can see the servomotors 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.289
 that drive the landing gear 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.039
 the motorcycle has the engine of the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.840
 madonna is similar and of the 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.860
 you have got engine power 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.509
 originally from the glasses more 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 Expects too since you thought there is coming 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.619
 some Italian superbike 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.750
 the optics of the motorcycle 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.470
 actually promises aggressive power 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.720
 pure 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.580
 All in all, April will be 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.250
 a balanced motorcycle and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 by no means an aggressive racing 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:53.520
 beasts or guys like you the thing with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:56.009
 aprilia villa is italy drove fine 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.439
 design dollar engine and with distance of 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.909
 best sound 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.290
 Nevertheless, the aprilia has something cold for me 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.119
 I'm just the first time 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 drove it and everything works 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.490
 very good we had 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.400
 pleasant performance she has good brakes 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.170
 great chassis altogether missing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 the pep of Italian motorcycles 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.760
 need the known and you have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.330
 yes, the concept is better 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.520
 implemented 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.959
 say Aprilia sport many 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.110
 Motorcycles is actually mine too 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.290
 italian favorite brand but you 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.680
 Build other motorcycle flowers better than 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680
 provide tools 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.439
 I have become the torture I am the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.230
 kapo nord already at the presentation 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.450
 drove and already noticed that 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.930
 a really good travel motorcycle 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.640
 for a long distance is because the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.060
 sitting position is pleasant the windbreak 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.599
 is good 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.000
 The engine fits quite well with a big one 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.250
 travel enduro because he pushes on good 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.870
 because it turns up and because it's incredible 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.819
 sounds good that is also my opinion 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.209
 to our six-comparative 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.400
 what has me the best core now synonymous 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.150
 again something has fallen less 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.230
 that they are very reluctant to 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.480
 to move curves 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.470
 you have to work hard that that 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.359
 the kapo nord moves the brakes are there 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.989
 Of course, there is nothing to it 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 find fault 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.099
 and the electronically adjustable 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.560
 chassis there are playing really 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.500
 at the top of the league with because ktm and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.319
 bmw have that too and and just that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.569
 this idea of ​​aprilia works 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.489
 actually very good if more 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.709
 on one on a comfortable level 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.209
 that's it actually for my social 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.970
 first impression of the campaign has 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:51.180
 how I sat on it was 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.180
 actually almost like ms on a clinic 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 Curling is comfortable sitting position 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:04:03.099
 very very soft and nice chairman 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.639
 seat cushion the engine is good 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.280
 average 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.030
 it has 125 ps compared 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:17.949
 actually the lowest power earth 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:19.959
 gs thanks live is 125ps at wide one 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.010
 higher torque and goes from below 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.389
 out a lot better off and has 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.050
 certainly not a sporty one for me 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:33.389
 motorcycle but for day trips 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.930
 around the 500 kilometer plus or more 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.930
 sure the right choice 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 his lads again briefly in the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.000
 jungle note looked up 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.770
 if someone complains that the kapo 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.900
 North has less power than the rest 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.729
 Of course that's not the truth 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.409
 truth is that it is the least 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.969
 torque change has 116 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.699
 newtonmeter and that's natural that 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.520
 You can feel it when you get out of the game 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.189
 the colleague has already noticed 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.930
 The aprilia will be the carports fans 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.490
 so far cabanas are driven of course 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.340
 brightly thrilled as a motor is 20 times 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.520
 as good as the predecessor in this 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.009
 Giant a huge selection portfolio 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.210
 arrival engines this will be april 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.340
 that I might do something difficult 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.590
 if she has no sheep to position 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.870
 you know the best all-rounder is the gs 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.050
 the fastest sportiest internet has 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.150
 he will stretch democracy far and wide 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.990
 If you want to drive take the castor for what 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.060
 one the aprilia 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.529
 she will not be in the lead anywhere but 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.159
 also somewhere in the back 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:58.199
 visually all Italian and who she is with 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.090
 the design of his heart closes ok then 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.520
 he does not have a bad one 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.110
 motorcycle will be very happy with her 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.680
 Thousands of kilometers of position below 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.680
 can play
