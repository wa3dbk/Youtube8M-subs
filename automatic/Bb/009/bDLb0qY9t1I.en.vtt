delicate little raindrops as soon as you
finish<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.090> meditation<00:00:12.750> that's<00:00:13.170> when<00:00:13.410> the

huge<00:00:13.740> triangular<00:00:14.340> craft<00:00:14.759> flew<00:00:15.150> over<00:00:15.480> us<00:00:15.509> for

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
huge triangular craft flew over us for

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.620 
huge triangular craft flew over us for
the<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.619> time<00:00:16.980> since<00:00:17.310> 2000<00:00:18.150> when<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.390> saw<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the first time since 2000 when we saw it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.320 
the first time since 2000 when we saw it
in<00:00:18.810> Pine<00:00:19.020> Bush<00:00:19.230> New<00:00:19.470> York<00:00:19.740> which<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.910> right

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
in Pine Bush New York which was right

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.689 
in Pine Bush New York which was right
after<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.320> first<00:00:22.769> time<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> appeared<00:00:23.519> in

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
after the first time it appeared in

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.540 
after the first time it appeared in
Mount<00:00:23.880> Shasta<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.779> September<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.380> 99<00:00:25.890> that's

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
Mount Shasta in September of 99 that's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.450 
Mount Shasta in September of 99 that's
correct<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.840> massive

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
correct and it was it was this massive

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.640 
correct and it was it was this massive
triangle<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.810> time<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.230> like

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
triangle so it was first time in like

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
triangle so it was first time in like
eight<00:00:31.890> years<00:00:31.920> or<00:00:32.489> seven<00:00:32.910> years<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.210> we'd

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
eight years or seven years that we'd

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
eight years or seven years that we'd
seen<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.809> right<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:34.950> eight<00:00:35.130> years<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.670> we'd

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
seen it right or eight years that we'd

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
seen it right or eight years that we'd
seen<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.140> amazing<00:00:37.530> yeah

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
seen it and it was it was amazing yeah

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
seen it and it was it was amazing yeah
it<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.899> at<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
it was and it was just at this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
it was and it was just at this
particular<00:00:40.320> place<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> meditation<00:00:41.640> again

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
particular place in the meditation again

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.979 
particular place in the meditation again
what<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.350> find<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> meditation

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
what we find is that we do a meditation

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
what we find is that we do a meditation
where<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> train<00:00:47.100> people<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.460> Remote<00:00:47.910> View

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
where we do train people to Remote View

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
where we do train people to Remote View
in<00:00:48.300> consciousness<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> contact

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
in consciousness we do the contact

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.340 
in consciousness we do the contact
protocols<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.390> where<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.840> but

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
protocols to show them where we are but

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
protocols to show them where we are but
then<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> sort<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.160> meditation<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
then we do this sort of meditation and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.930 
then we do this sort of meditation and
prayer<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:55.140> world<00:00:55.890> peace<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
prayer for world peace and for the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
prayer for world peace and for the
healing<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> earth<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.960> often<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
healing of the earth and often in the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.729 
healing of the earth and often in the
middle<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.850> process<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.530> show

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
middle of that process is when they show

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
middle of that process is when they show
up<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.129> everyone<00:01:02.579> gets<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> pure<00:01:03.480> heart

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
up when everyone gets into a pure heart

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.380 
up when everyone gets into a pure heart
its<00:01:04.019> place<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> clear<00:01:05.580> place<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.270> their

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
its place and in a clear place in their

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
its place and in a clear place in their
heart<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> mind<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.189> et

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
heart and mind that's when these et

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
heart and mind that's when these et
craft<00:01:09.000> show<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.900> amazing<00:01:10.439> things<00:01:10.650> happen

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
craft show up and amazing things happen

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
craft show up and amazing things happen
I<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:13.250> almost<00:01:14.250> invariably<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I know that almost invariably it's it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
I know that almost invariably it's it's
around<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.130> time<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.270> these<00:01:18.420> sort

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
around that time that we have these sort

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
around that time that we have these sort
of<00:01:18.659> experiences<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.189> that's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of experiences and I think that's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.649 
of experiences and I think that's
another<00:01:21.830> part<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> message<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.759> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
another part of the message is that you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.060 
another part of the message is that you
know<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:24.930> dealing<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:25.229> civilizations

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
know we're dealing with civilizations

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
know we're dealing with civilizations
that<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.880> once<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> reach<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.450> ability

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that you know once you reach the ability

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
that you know once you reach the ability
to<00:01:28.110> travel<00:01:28.380> faster<00:01:28.829> than<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> speed<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.250> light

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to travel faster than the speed of light

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.910 
to travel faster than the speed of light
there's<00:01:29.729> nothing<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.840> material<00:01:31.409> cosmos

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
there's nothing in the material cosmos

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.140 
there's nothing in the material cosmos
you<00:01:32.070> need<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.850> manifest

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you need because you can manifest

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.170 
you need because you can manifest
whatever<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.869> need<00:01:34.729> we're<00:01:35.729> even<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
whatever you need we're even at the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.569 
whatever you need we're even at the
point<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.320> know<00:01:37.650> physicists<00:01:38.460> who've

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
point now where I know physicists who've

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
point now where I know physicists who've
worked<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.240> Harvard<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.689> other<00:01:39.840> places<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
worked at Harvard in other places that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
worked at Harvard in other places that
have<00:01:40.560> done<00:01:40.740> work<00:01:41.610> where<00:01:41.850> there's<00:01:42.030> been

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
have done work where there's been

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.929 
have done work where there's been
literally<00:01:43.220> transmutation<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> elements

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
literally transmutation of the elements

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.870 
literally transmutation of the elements
where<00:01:45.710> things<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> been<00:01:47.250> created<00:01:47.670> using

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
where things can have been created using

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.190 
where things can have been created using
high<00:01:48.869> powerful<00:01:49.409> magnetic<00:01:49.860> fields<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.200> so

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
high powerful magnetic fields and and so
