going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> talk<00:00:14.429> us<00:00:14.580> through<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
going to talk us through it you know a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.330 
going to talk us through it you know a
little<00:00:15.330> bit<00:00:15.419> about<00:00:15.599> technology<00:00:15.929> why<00:00:16.830> built<00:00:17.160> it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
little bit about technology why built it

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
little bit about technology why built it
and<00:00:17.460> those<00:00:17.550> sort<00:00:17.759> of<00:00:17.790> things<00:00:17.849> but<00:00:18.210> basically

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and those sort of things but basically

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.950 
and those sort of things but basically
the<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.369> concept<00:00:20.759> of<00:00:20.880> coaxial<00:00:21.329> rotor<00:00:21.540> system

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the the concept of coaxial rotor system

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.389 
the the concept of coaxial rotor system
has<00:00:22.050> been<00:00:22.200> around<00:00:22.380> since<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.710> da<00:00:22.890> Vinci<00:00:23.309> I

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
has been around since the da Vinci I

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:27.109 
has been around since the da Vinci I
mean<00:00:23.579> 1400<00:00:24.300> 1500<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:26.070> we<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.790> finally

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
mean 1400 1500 and we just we finally

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.760 
mean 1400 1500 and we just we finally
have<00:00:27.239> the<00:00:27.329> materials<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.989> the<00:00:28.079> technology<00:00:28.649> we

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
have the materials and the technology we

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.109 
have the materials and the technology we
can<00:00:28.919> make<00:00:29.009> it<00:00:29.130> lightweight<00:00:29.460> enough<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.700> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
can make it lightweight enough that the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.630 
can make it lightweight enough that the
the<00:00:30.719> concept<00:00:31.230> actually<00:00:31.380> works<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the concept actually works and what the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.040 
the concept actually works and what the
coaxial<00:00:33.030> rotor<00:00:33.210> system<00:00:33.570> does<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.870> eliminate

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
coaxial rotor system does is eliminate

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
coaxial rotor system does is eliminate
the<00:00:34.350> torque<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> craft<00:00:35.160> which<00:00:35.550> eliminates

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the torque on the craft which eliminates

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.900 
the torque on the craft which eliminates
the<00:00:36.180> need<00:00:36.629> for<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.250> which<00:00:38.250> makes<00:00:38.490> the<00:00:38.610> flight

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the need for it which makes the flight

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.490 
the need for it which makes the flight
controls<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> lot<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> simplifies<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> because

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
controls a lot it simplifies it because

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.920 
controls a lot it simplifies it because
you<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.740> have<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.010> foot<00:00:41.220> pedals<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
you don't have to have foot pedals and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.569 
you don't have to have foot pedals and
traditional<00:00:42.930> helicopter<00:00:43.470> controls<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.160> one

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
traditional helicopter controls are one

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
traditional helicopter controls are one
of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> hardest<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> fly<00:00:45.660> basically

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of the hardest things to fly basically

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
of the hardest things to fly basically
you<00:00:47.490> eliminate<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.970> tail<00:00:48.180> rotor<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.600> foot

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you eliminate the tail rotor in the foot

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.940 
you eliminate the tail rotor in the foot
pedals<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.290> get<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pedals and you get it down to a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.390

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's it's a lot safer and weight wise it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's it's a lot safer and weight wise it
qualifies<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:14.969> ultralight<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> don't

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
qualifies as an ultralight so you don't

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.169 
qualifies as an ultralight so you don't
have<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.219> a<00:01:17.249> pilot's<00:01:17.609> license<00:01:17.969> to<00:01:18.060> fly

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.719 
that under 50 feet just for for safety
reasons<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.459> technically<00:01:26.459> you're<00:01:26.639> only

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
reasons but technically you're only

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090 
reasons but technically you're only
limited<00:01:26.939> by<00:01:27.149> like<00:01:27.840> any<00:01:28.049> aircraft<00:01:28.439> by<00:01:28.590> wind

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
we have just completed the design and

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.289 
we have just completed the design and
the<00:01:35.100> testing<00:01:35.459> on<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.579> Aero<00:01:35.729> twin<00:01:35.969> engine

the testing on the Aero twin engine

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
the testing on the Aero twin engine
which<00:01:36.389> we<00:01:36.539> designed<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.499> really

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
which we designed and that's really

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.959 
which we designed and that's really
