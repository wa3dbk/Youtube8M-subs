00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.420
 Just show how to pack texture 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.480
 or 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.000
 can install spex in minecraft 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.830
 it will be at normal so at 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.740
 bought minecraft work and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.870
 especially I do it like still 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.160
 how it works at the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.730
 minecraft what you are on my side 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.460
 documents can be so that here 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.070
 what we need is we have to do that 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.489
 once it must have started 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.700
 in the 18 everything is so play after 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.520
 we started that once and that 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.489
 then has been finished loading here 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.530
 we can close that again 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:07.490
 opened launcher again and that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.229
 press doing here on edit incident 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.670
 here on minecraft then the opens 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.119
 minecraft folder as is already 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.300
 is yes and we see here is not 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.170
 respect folder with people you indeed 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.640
 I would have to start a respact here 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.580
 be folder that would not be a problem 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.250
 then you just take respect what 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.220
 you want and then move in 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.140
 I have started this way now and I have 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.610
 no respect folder now that is 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.840
 not so difficult what some people 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.220
 So some people have the comments 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.349
 just did not understand how to do that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.670
 Now, this is what makes it easy here 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:47.890
 just a new folder here with 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.890
 right-click and just call it 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.740
 respect i hope i have it right 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.370
 written 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.320
 Jasas right on then you still need 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.000
 a giant spec i just got that from 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.520
 courbet the power taken that is that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.619
 of this, so sex on the power easy 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.750
 this link will be the description 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.420
 grab and I just got 64 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 tremendous ones look here here 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.480
 I do not recommend it works 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.150
 not even with me this works 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.740
 but I still succeed 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.650
 the here is just recommended would have to 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.820
 Most people work 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.260
 otherwise a little less 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.820
 graphic but i found i find 64 64 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.090
 is enough from 16 sees 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.950
 horrible and 32 you can still 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.770
 but you do not have to take 64 x 560 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.870
 is perfectly alright so then you have 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.400
 you just have your zip file if you like 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.070
 again here then you can see here 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.770
 everything so weird would have one 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.770
 zip file or folder is on it 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.020
 what you have she is just in there 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.820
 and you just got minecraft 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.760
 and yes and press play 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.400
 if that would go on play it 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.150
 always starts a force and then 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.580
 all we have to do is just add the options 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.709
 or stop functions as it is 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.800
 respect and then we see here 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.140
 we can now also eye 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.010
 Respectfully or just in German blabla 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:28.870
 then only then do you see that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.670
 Here again then as normal 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.320
 180 that's easy with it 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.540
 above normal things is over it 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.100
 click on the then so in the case 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.350
 it's not because only one because 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.630
 then it is done installed 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.060
 then just in any world i have 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.320
 do not make a quick test now 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.820
 I just have one to show you 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.820
 that it really works 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.630
 Of course, you do not work well 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.140
 now have the 18 skin in the case now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.200
 it depends so much on what we for 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.660
 a texture pack did you see 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.310
 everything works here inventory blabla 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.290
 everything would have to work if that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.090
 does not work then lies 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.260
 most likely to 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.239
 so if you have any mistakes 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.760
 then it lies as loud as it is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 most likely to texture pack and 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.550
 then I just want to think 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.120
 So try what I mean with mine 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.100
 easy with it is fix if it is not there 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.990
 works then you really have one 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.310
 made mistakes i have now so again 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.050
 short explained I have the video synonymous only 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.170
 made because a lot of people have problems 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.420
 I had not and not now 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.970
 every extra facebook by private jet 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.790
 wanted to explain how that works and yes 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:53.260
