00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.719 
them but you know their problems and a
t-butyl<00:01:50.030> might<00:01:50.810> be<00:01:50.960> quicker<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.500> go<00:01:51.740> down<00:01:52.130> but

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
t-butyl might be quicker to go down but

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.340
