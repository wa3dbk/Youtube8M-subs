00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 here is a reptile that you can't not have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.470
 never seen also because perhaps the snake 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 more common in our parts 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'm talking about the white year of its 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 viridiflavus a reptile belonging to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 as well as the order of the scaled al 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.039
 suborder of profits to the family of 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.630
 colubridi let's look at his 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 distribution 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.010
 the record is found throughout Italy 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 including Sicily and Sardinia 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.370
 outside of Italy it is also found 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 in corsica and most of france 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.290
 continental as well as in small parts of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.290
 slovenia building and finally also mortar 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.940
 how to describe the whitewash is 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.430
 really a beautiful snake with shapes 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 slender and slender and from the tail that goes 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.350
 gradually thinning giving this 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.750
 especially an even more refined aspect 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 head and oval eyes are elongated 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.299
 the rotunda la is large and provided with puppets 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.920
 length is noticeable and not infrequently the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.600
 Biacco exceeds the meter and a half 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.340
 sometimes reaching a height of 170 cm 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.150
 the males however are on average a little 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 larger and heavier than females 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.229
 the livery is very variable but often 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.560
 this snake has a color of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 whitish greenish yellow background 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 practically covered by one 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 black or dark green pigmentation that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 shaped by nature or intertwining of march 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 the aforementioned pigmentation has the best 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.460
 on the light background color so that the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 snake is basically dark 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.409
 the parts with thin clear stripes 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.409
 lower are generally lighter 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 as I said however the library is 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.860
 very variable and also exist 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.369
 particularly dark specimens and here 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.049
 I open a small systematic speech 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.719
 next to the nominal subspecies year 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.399
 of his of Slavic flavus spiri is 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.099
 the subspecies was also recognized 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.450
 year of its viridiflavus carbonari hus 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.629
 initially it was believed that specimens 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.140
 almost all blacks called melanomas c 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.520
 completely black called melani ci 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 belonged exclusively to the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.560
 carbonari subspecies hus recent studies 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.110
 genetic and geographic have instead put 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.239
 in light like the aforementioned dark specimens 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.510
 can appear independently in 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.489
 both subspecies nonetheless i 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 two phenotypes, the classical and the one 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.230
 dark are called respectively 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.190
 phenotype viridiflavus and phenotype 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.860
 carbonari hus I take advantage also for 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390
 clear up a little thing despite the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.090
 profane tend to call with 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.790
 the appellative of snakes on snakes 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.620
 not poisonous and therefore also white from a 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 geologically and absolutely 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.840
 wrong the snakes properly so called 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.030
 they are the snakes belonging to the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 matricide family is represented 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.920
 in particular from the matrix genus yes 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.830
 it is particularly snakes 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.840
 linked to wetlands and water the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.760
 white and all other representatives 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 of the family of colubrids damage 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.879
 instead called colubri but we return to the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.260
 White 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.909
 it is a very snake 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.890
 adaptable that populates a large number 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.230
 of environments preferring those rich in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.379
 vegetation like cultivated fields woods 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 and circuits goes up to 2,000 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.129
 meters of altitude and prefers in 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.280
 particular habitat characterized by 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.769
 dry stone walls and ruins and quick agile 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.420
 and snappy and able to crawl 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.250
 very quickly as of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.780
 climb small walls and trees 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.370
 buildings 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.220
 if necessary he is also a good swimmer 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.470
 and active mainly during the day and 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.780
 being a reptile therefore hetero thermo 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.780
 Spends a lot of time warming up in the sun 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.299
 mainly on rocks and stones 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.760
 micromammals which he often studies 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.950
 hunting dens and tunnels also at 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.950
 phoebe I like big insects and others 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.290
 reptiles like lizards green lizards 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.819
 and even other snakes sometimes too 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.519
 living the rat snake has a proud character 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.310
 aggressive if annoyed try to 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.030
 run away but sirica is prevented 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.650
 easily echo repeatedly 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.030
 even if he has a nice bully 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.970
 it is not a question of a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.130
 poisonous snake his bites can 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.350
 just be a little painful and at the limit 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.889
 slightly irritating because of her 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.900
 saliva while in winter the white passes 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.479
 a very short period of activity 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.300
 a kind of hibernation underground or 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.250
 however the places sheltered in spring 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.020
 males fight proudly for 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.970
 grab the right to mate 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.039
 with females 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.570
 you often see them while you are 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.599
 twist on each other in 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.789
 attempt to overwhelm each other in 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:01.240
 full summer the female lays from 5 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:05.400
 at 15 o'clock elongated and long white 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.400
 about 3 centimeters in a sheltered place 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.630
 the little ones in the field present the 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.460
 typical scrub livery of the adult also 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.370
 on the body they show more color 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.919
 they are already brownish or grayish 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.039
 able to look after themselves kick 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.320
 small insect lizards if everything goes 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.840
 well a rat snake in the wild can live a 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.160
 fifteen years 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.610
 I personally love this snake 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.320
 quick and lively with a lively character 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.050
 if you are lucky enough to see one of me 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.810
 I recommend you respect it and observe it 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.099
 as I said and repeated it is harmless e 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.099
 deserves all the attention possible
