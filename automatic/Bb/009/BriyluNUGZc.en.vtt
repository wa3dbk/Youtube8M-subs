00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.800
 today it shows only one program 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.960
 then a relatively short speech promo sub ita + 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:13.539
 I present land 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.679
 points I no longer set up 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.119
 very complicated and therefore we begin 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.319
 become aware of what can become the game of tripolar checkers 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.989
 I can enhance complexity 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.499
 it is not one of the most 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.850
 difficult tarot neatly 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.280
 but neither 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.080
 the simplest 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.020
 If you already prepared lohannes to eat together we will look for the solution together 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.130
 and we'll see that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.250
 that mechanism we talked about in previous meetings 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.490
 what you gave me the sizing 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.320
 and in the middle 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.970
 with which we are not able to make use of 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.280
 this shot 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.159
 poste 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.479
 obviously to all the pesaro rules 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.080
 also my knowledge 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.290
 pooh new at the start 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.670
 which gradation of white 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
 does not seem particularly 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 It is important to preserve I have this move but it can be done because 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.070
 miranda range rover away 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.160
 server 2000 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.530
 would eat back here 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 let's say they stay 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.450
 I can't believe in you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.820
 the same is true for this reason I am not here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.790
 other types of moves 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.740
 would present 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.490
 however of the contraindications 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 strategic for example this move 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.260
 strategic 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.880
 photo a rover character 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.299
 active this 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.299
 this move pokemon taken bank 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.460
 love let's say 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.520
 the strange is a little albino of the game 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.820
 but all this 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.290
 ok all these things actions 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.160
 fall in front of the fact that white in this situation wins 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.859
 and wins with a shot 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.949
 quite complicated 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.059
 that begins 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.059
 furnishing 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.449
 this beautiful 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.209
 remorse 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.589
 because this piece for viral infections for confirmation 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.729
 second step 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.959
 in the other two 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.959
 and black 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.959
 this maneuver for the purpose 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.279
 unibo I don't see what we need 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.669
 clear this box as you see it begins 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.469
 to manifest itself away 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.979
 dimd circular laughter 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:59.029
 and now here is the decisive last move we give to feed two more pieces 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.779
 until I am investigated 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.259
 now 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.259
 let's move on to the second phase 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.519
 apathy 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.029
 this, cure 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:16.299
 the rivers I told you about there 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.329
 we formally attack discovered how to get to salt 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.329
 who can't eat us for the simple fact 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.979
 what impression 2 from another part if you remember 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.999
 is a previous state when no, these two verses we have created i 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:38.049
 preconditions for this double socket we made our casting 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.269
 and here is that 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.449
 indeed in May 2 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.019
 the things we do 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.009
 we eat could be only once and with these three pieces 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.839
 we operate different purposes while we remove 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.729
 2 3 this well if this piece we allow 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.279
 slim a road with a montijo outlet 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.529
 hold forced to what to eat 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.529
 we do not print and brown 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:11.810
 4 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.419
 hi5 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.799
 deduced 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.049
 why not get stuck 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.199
 we are alone 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.529
 invoice 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.360
 in this example 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.669
 certainly not trivial 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.960
 not within everyone's reach but they are very close players 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.460
 I just wanted to show you the infinite possibilities 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.479
 find this game and it's me in all this 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.050
 s ... its beauty goodbye
