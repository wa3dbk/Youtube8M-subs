00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.299
 Hello everyone and telling you 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.839
 Alexis Mels and many of you have asked 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.390
 tell about the gta series that i am now and 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:25.300
 I will do it will certainly not all 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.179
 games but the most interesting I will touch 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.630
 and before the story I want to say that 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:34.410
 It turns out I have a game channel and I 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.910
 thought why not adapt it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.250
 so now there will go out and 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.460
 cuts from games about which I will be you 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.660
 tell so let's say what's left 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.690
 behind the scenes 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.050
 tell about whom is interesting link in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.059
 Description Well, I'll start the story 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.840
 let's say so unexpectedly 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.929
 will not go from the first part but similarly 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.489
 similar to her and even superior to 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:06.940
 something i 'm talking about playing grand theft auto 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.140
 london 1969 is the first addition to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.750
 gta games 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.170
 and its gameplay exactly copies 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.830
 the first part is why I chose her 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.360
 because nostalgia for the good old and 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.820
 gram sit and in the evening after school and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.320
 immersed in a world of complete carelessness 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.860
 and appeasement well gta actually 1 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.650
 just didn't go with me and I found just 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.170
 similar to them well and a bit of nostalgia 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 there are still different games only 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.270
 the scene of the first part is three 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.880
 cities liberty city sanandres 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.420
 and wai city separately we are talking about 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.870
 will go to the next games in the series for many 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.410
 probably from you there were earlier collections of games 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.170
 not these miserable from alawar in which 50 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.830
 games are all god like each other and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 I'm also not interested in collections 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.039
 in the style of the 200 best games of all genres 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.030
 or 70 games for 1 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.099
 skil of course 200 games were only 40 but 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.620
 yet it was some kind of excitement 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.530
 acquire such discs one of these 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 drives and gave me a brother he looks like 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.989
 this one what you see on the screen but 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.739
 only he was red and there was 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:34.060
 70 games, of course, were not all but those that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.519
 I installed was not enough and there was gta 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.889
 london 1969 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:44.950
 it is a pity that this disk is lost irrevocably 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:48.909
 but okay as the name implies action 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.980
 happens in london 1969 us 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.659
 to perform various missions in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.019
 criminal role climbing career 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.959
 the stairs at the beginning we have to choose 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.629
 character for which we want to play next 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.650
 we appear on the streets of london where we and 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.109
 to continue their journey 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.919
 what immediately catches the eye of the fans 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.750
 modern this is correct top view that 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:16.269
 not at all annoying and 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.479
 you feel free to act free 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.180
 to move the world and the world represents 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.799
 are levels on each of which we 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.709
 will need to dial a certain 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.870
 number of points and money for passing 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.569
 missions money points can be spent on 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.180
 painting a car for a rebirth 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.449
 after death and bribing the cops but on 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.909
 it's better money is not worth spending than 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.780
 less points mean less chance of going on 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.440
 next level 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.979
 and that there with missions there is as basic 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.430
 so and the side missions we take 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:53.229
 from the phone booths missions represents 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.659
 a different types of tasks to disassemble 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:59.229
 man steal car kill gang 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:03.280
 blow unwanted get away from the police and so 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:05.500
 etc. Well you do not have to miss standing 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.859
 remind that there is no saving in the game 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.229
 so if you don't complete the task 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.720
 failing thereby it will disappear and 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.419
 will only appear when you restart the game 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.620
 so do the job carefully 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.470
 side quests appear here 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.320
 the same is only secondary and 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.889
 the main plot is not much affected but 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.850
 but 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.010
 affect your budget so now gameplay 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.590
 we run through the streets of london a 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.430
 therefore don't forget what 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.190
 left-hand traffic here forgetting this you 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.750
 risk getting caught by cops from whom 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.260
 so easy to leave 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.260
 driving a car here reminds 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.510
 good old race Tetris if you go 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.419
 up at great speed and not see 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.479
 oncoming cars and always bump what 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.370
 really pissed me off in this game but 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.370
 as I said to everything you can 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.320
 get used the more there are different 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.260
 types of cars and motorcycles 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.590
 different speeds and strengths yes even here 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.220
 tanks have regard to walking 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.810
 i like her no longer bump into 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.960
 the police do not run away with a cry 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.630
 where to be those though just walking 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.199
 collect weapons here there are several 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.840
 species 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.139
 the gun that almost always appears 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.349
 in a box near the spawn who he is here 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.539
 called rocket launcher body armor and 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.690
 flamethrower artificial intelligence 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.389
 the cops at least hit me 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.210
 read the player action can you just 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.980
 blow up like a kamikaze easy to pull out 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.470
 from the car there are bonuses that 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.410
 need to look like there is 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.600
 extra life points multiplier 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.470
 accelerator which speeds up the player or 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.910
 car and police badge 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.310
 reducing the number of pursued 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.740
 police game is not bad visually 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.470
 dynamically stylistically 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.010
 has its hardcore than and deserved 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.510
 my confession bothered these new games 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.180
 play gta 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:19.030
 one of the three first london 1969 or else 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.530
 one addition that came out later 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.720
 london 1961 which though did not have 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.530
 popularity mainly due to lack of 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.780
 advertising 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.010
 but has many interesting additions 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:35.710
 by the way there is a film of 77 called 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.110
 big auto theft in the original 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.500
 grand theft auto title 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.260
 but the attitude of the game it is not so 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.120
 more game came out much later well here 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.540
 in short, I told you about this 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.670
 fine game in a week wait for a new 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.130
 release about the next part of the game 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.700
 for now you can follow the link in 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:01.030
 the description on my grief i am playing the channel 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:04.030
 I drink the amount and wait for the release there all that 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.220
 left overs already playing first 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.340
 part and write your opinion to me 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.740
 it's interesting to know him well what can I do 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.320
 say with you was telling 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.320
 alexis miles good luck to new meetings 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.710
 but
