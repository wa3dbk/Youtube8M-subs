the purpose of the Honda smart home is

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.030 
the purpose of the Honda smart home is
to<00:00:09.450> think<00:00:09.629> about<00:00:09.839> environmental<00:00:10.169> technology

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
to think about environmental technology

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.470 
to think about environmental technology
and<00:00:11.280> how<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.519> will<00:00:11.610> influence<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.179> homes<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and how it will influence the homes of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.089 
and how it will influence the homes of

power for homes is growing so quickly

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.450 
power for homes is growing so quickly
but<00:01:08.260> this<00:01:08.380> can<00:01:08.530> create<00:01:08.770> an<00:01:08.890> issue<00:01:09.010> for<00:01:09.280> grid

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
but this can create an issue for grid

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.430 
but this can create an issue for grid
operators<00:01:09.940> because<00:01:10.360> solar<00:01:10.690> power<00:01:10.900> fluctuates

through<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.710> day<00:01:11.860> it's<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.640> challenge<00:01:12.970> that's

through the day it's a challenge that's

likely to increase in the future so the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.249

you<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:21.220> grid<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.580> balanced<00:01:21.940> your
