have been trying to help people
understand<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:33.060> years<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.349> fact<00:02:34.379> that

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
understand for years is the fact that

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.619 
understand for years is the fact that
ordinary<00:02:36.920> filtration<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.549> cannot<00:02:39.000> remove

our health again specific examples of
this<00:02:46.079> would<00:02:46.290> be<00:02:46.349> things<00:02:46.799> like<00:02:46.889> heavy<00:02:47.370> metals

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
this would be things like heavy metals

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.599 
this would be things like heavy metals

much science there's so much information

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:44.390 
much science there's so much information
that<00:03:42.509> we<00:03:42.720> could<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.129> literally<00:03:44.129> for<00:03:44.370> hours

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that we could go on literally for hours

that we could go on literally for hours
and<00:03:45.000> hours<00:03:45.150> but<00:03:46.109> again<00:03:46.379> we<00:03:46.680> want<00:03:46.919> to<00:03:47.009> try<00:03:47.310> and

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
and hours but again we want to try and

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.210 
and hours but again we want to try and
keep<00:03:47.609> this<00:03:47.879> as<00:03:48.060> brief<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:49.049> as<00:03:49.620> short<00:03:49.859> as<00:03:50.069> we
