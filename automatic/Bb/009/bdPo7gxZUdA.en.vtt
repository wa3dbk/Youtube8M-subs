00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.089
 speaking on luis gamez children fashion more 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.799
 a video and today first impressions 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.980
 of this third-person shooter 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.809
 called diesel using me 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.660
 impressed the first visit in which I 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 disappointed when on paper by playing 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 when dirceu was announced by the NGO 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.600
 planet I went after videos and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.289
 seek to know a little more about the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.570
 game and I have seen great videos 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.400
 after I got the game through 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 play in hands he ended up disappointing me 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.899
 a little the skill is very nice 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 as mobility that has an entire team 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.520
 I had and everything but I stayed 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.280
 disappointed with the graphics that I had 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.329
 seen videos with very beautiful textures 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
 and everything else 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 and although the graphics are even cute 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.879
 here strait band caracolac nÃ© 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.190
 although the graphics are even cute 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.230
 here they fall far short of the videos 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 that I had a risk but the gameplay 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 It's a lot of fun, it 's not such a sport. 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.559
 similar to mars 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.299
 although you have the same elements of the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
 mouse here things are a little 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.580
 different now you touch the wall 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.670
 you have simply to press the wall 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 You can touch her to make a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 cover you crouch you can walk 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 Looks cool and squishy, â€‹â€‹bacaninha. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 he has a very similar gameplay 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 with game dynamics fps games is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.479
 very similar to those of fps not so much 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 as the tps which is more that system of 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.520
 cover of the more here you go pulling to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.060
 Finding out who is jumping and making those 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.640
 crazy good style fps same and what 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.590
 greatly favors combat even 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 melee and has these differences 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.049
 here you just killed 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.689
 also 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.880
 you have primary weapon is that from now 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.950
 its second area than this species of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 ax for you to run the galera looks 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.549
 you can cut the wall and the third one is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 a grenade as well as a skill that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.460
 charges as you kill the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.810
 enemies 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.620
 let me see if I can kill someone to 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.540
 carry the mass that the country near a 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.080
 sniper shot here takes explode to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.080
 head 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.989
 I 'm kind of blind, it's okay 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.360
 hello friends to kill the guy right there 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.610
 game started the closed beta phase today 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.879
 in fact it 's a close the open beta 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.860
 because I did not receive any just one 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.659
 I registered there on the planet's website and 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.129
 I downloaded the game I'm playing 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.590
 So, whoever I want will let me 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.670
 description , go there and see if you can 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.780
 catch to play 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.390
 it's a shame I will not be able to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.120
 bring to stream the game do not run 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.970
 window mode the game is not 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.530
 selectable by my program 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.489
 live stream I'm recording it with 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.489
 phelps in sacrifice even though I do not 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:11.299
 I'm from record or fred finished singer 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.299
 walk like hell as above 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:22.460
 oh kaka do it 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.620
 died shit 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.230
 you can see that the movement will search 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.020
 sebben shearing is not that thing well 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.420
 equal or greater fluid if everything else is 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.250
 extremely fun even more 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.190
 maps that I thought were fine 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.290
 made you know you have maps that exist 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.020
 different possibilities of battle here 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 and I liked that aspect just did not like 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.420
 even the movement of the characters 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.690
 which is a very rough and 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:04:01.370
 also of graphics but it is a game 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:04.150
 playable try right try to enable the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.150
 my wrote 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.709
 was what support that hamburg 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.290
 thrashed the mark the starter died the game 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.470
 from the mouth 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:26.910
 It will be when my son is gay. 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.620
 no you can see right tim good're're so bad 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:34.620
 so come on in I will not 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.540
 Can you show this? 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.670
 one thing I also noticed that they did not 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.080
 much use shopping system 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.510
 who is using the same 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.590
 run here are the old caraca snipers 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.350
 only speak right 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.300
 let us take the sword in the midst of the forehead 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.550
 that machine gun personnel do not have 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.740
 very used cover system 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.800
 I at least did not feel any will 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.800
 to use because the maps are wide open 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.560
 and broadly favors combat against 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.180
 front with pakokku and I do not need 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.180
 get too much on this conversion stop 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.730
 is watching stutter play 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:29.660
 Let's go, but let's get the 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:29.660
 Guys there comes shit 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.340
 Ah, I'll execute and face when I 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:47.390
 run a year comes to my plant and the 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:49.640
 What the fuck or the boring urban sniper jumped 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.500
 get there go here now it's gone 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.870
 much up there can also be the 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:00.190
 guys are already marking not take a 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.190
 type of sniper you meet 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.449
 there are good signs with the dem but I die 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.270
 for this guy here in our 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.569
 fifth of hell it 's me for this guy 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:28.560
 which is also nasty 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:28.560
 the hsi but would not be the mate 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.639
 to get the expensive vehicles off where you 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:40.689
 That unfortunate man left in the machado process 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.689
 from hell 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.819
 come on and some time comes 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.310
 Battle begins to play the song 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:56.139
 causing distress in all people, right? 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.139
 Okay, relax. 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:07.060
 I already killed myself was php a focker and I 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:10.320
 I killed Muggle the Lamonic is the time when 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:16.620
 the car exploded 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:19.860
 there tosqueira the tosqueira mano game fell 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.700
 I was hoping something would come up another shit 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.700
 and little else 

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:42.050
 heck inside the goal 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.050
 inner side
