00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because of some things that were going

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
because of some things that were going
on<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:38.880> issues<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> problems<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on with some issues and problems that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
on with some issues and problems that
had<00:01:40.650> been<00:01:40.799> reported<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.790> currently

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
had been reported so it's currently

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
had been reported so it's currently
unavailable<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.439> unclear<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.820> returned

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
unavailable it is unclear if it returned

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.420 
unavailable it is unclear if it returned
in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> next<00:01:45.810> update<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.799> likely<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in the next update but it is likely to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
in the next update but it is likely to
the<00:01:47.850> chances<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> will<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.899> enabled<00:01:49.649> back

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the chances are it will be enabled back

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.139 
the chances are it will be enabled back
in<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> next<00:01:50.159> update<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.670> there's<00:01:51.060> no

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
in the next update but there's no

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.270 
in the next update but there's no
confirmed<00:01:51.509> noticed<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.979> that's<00:01:53.070> just

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
confirmed noticed on that so that's just

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
confirmed noticed on that so that's just
kind<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> room<00:01:53.939> at<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> minute<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.840> david

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
kind of room at a minute but david

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.310 
kind of room at a minute but david
vonderhaar<00:01:55.409> did<00:01:55.799> say<00:01:56.009> add<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.630> make

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
vonderhaar did say add that he will make

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.100 
vonderhaar did say add that he will make
some<00:01:58.530> changes<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.000> games<00:02:00.360> lower<00:02:00.689> score

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
some changes to the games lower score

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.109 
some changes to the games lower score
streak<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> UAV<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.880> he's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
streak and that is the UAV and he's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.289 
streak and that is the UAV and he's
thinking<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.619> UAV<00:02:04.979> maybe<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.939> bit<00:02:06.180> too

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
thinking that the UAV maybe is a bit too

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
thinking that the UAV maybe is a bit too
easy<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> people<00:02:07.500> keep<00:02:07.680> having<00:02:08.160> them

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
easy to get and people keep having them

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.369 
easy to get and people keep having them
as<00:02:08.399> their<00:02:08.550> main<00:02:08.759> star<00:02:09.509> t<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.810> especially

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
as their main star t with especially

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.540 
as their main star t with especially
getting<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> maps<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.250> things<00:02:11.370> like

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
getting to know the maps and things like

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.500 
getting to know the maps and things like
that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.270 
that
there<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.049> know<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.409> you<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.739> load<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> them

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
there you know if you get a load of them

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.009 
there you know if you get a load of them
it<00:02:14.459> can't<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.939> quite<00:02:15.420> powerful<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it can't really be quite powerful and

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.259 
it can't really be quite powerful and
quite<00:02:16.560> game-changing<00:02:17.159> so<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.120> some

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
quite game-changing so if you make some

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.210 
quite game-changing so if you make some
higher<00:02:18.510> score<00:02:18.870> streaks<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:20.010> gonna<00:02:20.129> be

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
higher score streaks then it's gonna be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
higher score streaks then it's gonna be
hard<00:02:20.340> people<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.670> get<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.689> there

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
hard people to get and you know there

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.210 
hard people to get and you know there
won't<00:02:21.870> be<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.140> many<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.530> them<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.829> maybe<00:02:22.980> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
won't be so many of them and maybe so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.339 
won't be so many of them and maybe so
overused<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.819> don't<00:02:24.569> know<00:02:24.720> if<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.170> so

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
overused I don't know if I like this so

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.780 
overused I don't know if I like this so
much<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.739> really<00:02:26.010> wish<00:02:26.099> they<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.489> keep<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
much I really wish they just keep it the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
much I really wish they just keep it the
way<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:26.939> is<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:27.629> i<00:02:27.659> love<00:02:28.170> using<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.680> UAVs

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
way it is because i love using the UAVs

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.220 
way it is because i love using the UAVs
and<00:02:29.250> i<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:29.940> making<00:02:30.090> them<00:02:30.269> harder<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.049> get

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and i think making them harder to get

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.199 
and i think making them harder to get
it's<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.680> gonna<00:02:31.799> buck<00:02:32.340> me<00:02:32.370> off<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.610> bit<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
it's just gonna buck me off a bit I

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's just gonna buck me off a bit I
don't<00:02:33.599> know<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.349> annoying<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:35.220> right

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
don't know it's just annoying all right

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.069 
don't know it's just annoying all right
it's<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.670> annoying<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.299> want<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> use<00:02:36.599> my<00:02:36.629> UAVs

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
it's just annoying I want to use my UAVs

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.069 
it's just annoying I want to use my UAVs
I<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.379> using<00:02:37.560> them<00:02:37.799> but<00:02:38.690> then<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.870> don't

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
I like using them but then I don't

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.300 
I like using them but then I don't
really<00:02:40.349> think<00:02:40.530> they're<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> bad<00:02:40.980> anyway

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
really think they're that bad anyway

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.410 
really think they're that bad anyway
because<00:02:41.519> people<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.879> have<00:02:41.970> ghosts<00:02:42.209> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because people can have ghosts and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.520 
because people can have ghosts and
things<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.689> kind<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.049> come<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.409> it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
things like that kind of come to it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.289 
things like that kind of come to it
although<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.129> don't<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.459> lot<00:02:44.640> goes<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:45.030> quite<00:02:45.269> a

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
although you don't a lot goes to quite a

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.039 
although you don't a lot goes to quite a
higher<00:02:46.310> level<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.879> time<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.870> tell

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
higher level so you know time will tell

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.780 
higher level so you know time will tell
if<00:02:49.109> they'll<00:02:49.920> actually<00:02:50.069> happen<00:02:50.579> these<00:02:50.670> are

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
if they'll actually happen these are

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.860 
if they'll actually happen these are
obviously<00:02:51.000> still<00:02:51.090> things<00:02:51.569> have<00:02:51.750> been

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
obviously still things have been

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.300 
obviously still things have been
discussed<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.920> been<00:02:53.010> released

along<00:02:55.319> with<00:02:55.650> if<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.099> put<00:02:56.519> up<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.849> you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
along with if it was put up and you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.640 
along with if it was put up and you
never<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.299> yet<00:02:57.510> mash<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.319> better<00:02:58.500> of

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
the game also david vonderhaar said that

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.849 
the game also david vonderhaar said that
SMG<00:03:02.310> penetration<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.180> probably<00:03:03.989> too<00:03:04.290> high<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
SMG penetration is probably too high and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.649 
SMG penetration is probably too high and
it's<00:03:05.250> something<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.609> studio<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.150> looking

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
it's something the studio is looking

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.430 
it's something the studio is looking
into<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.709> next<00:03:07.980> update<00:03:08.159> i<00:03:09.109> yes<00:03:10.109> again<00:03:10.409> i

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
into for the next update i yes again i

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.559 
into for the next update i yes again i
am<00:03:10.739> not<00:03:10.889> convinced<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.370> penetration<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.299> too

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
am not convinced that penetration is too

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.660 
am not convinced that penetration is too
high<00:03:12.750> maybe<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.409> SMGs<00:03:14.040> i<00:03:14.159> think<00:03:14.310> are<00:03:14.400> always

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
high maybe it is SMGs i think are always

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.610 
high maybe it is SMGs i think are always
going<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.909> be<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.540> ones<00:03:15.569> up<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.290> rule

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
going to be the ones up there that rule

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
going to be the ones up there that rule
the<00:03:17.069> roost<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.609> sense<00:03:17.849> but<00:03:18.209> i<00:03:18.269> feel<00:03:18.480> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the roost in a sense but i feel that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.689 
the roost in a sense but i feel that
they<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.810> balanced<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.980> much<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.549> they<00:03:20.669> should

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
they are balanced as much as they should

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.490 
they are balanced as much as they should
be<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.569> know<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.959> start<00:03:22.139> to<00:03:22.260> go<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.410> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
be you know when you start to go to the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.439 
be you know when you start to go to the
longer<00:03:22.799> distance<00:03:22.949> i<00:03:23.220> feel<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.430> SMGs<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.000> start

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
longer distance i feel the SMGs to start

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.949 
longer distance i feel the SMGs to start
to<00:03:24.599> burn<00:03:24.750> off<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> bit<00:03:25.349> but<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.419> you--am<00:03:27.419> were

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
to burn off a bit but if you--am were

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.330 
to burn off a bit but if you--am were
going<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.849> buff<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.560> salt<00:03:31.859> rifles

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
going to buff that the the salt rifles

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.099 
going to buff that the the salt rifles
then<00:03:32.579> maybe<00:03:32.849> yeah<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.629> nothing<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
then maybe yeah you know nothing the

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.110 
then maybe yeah you know nothing the
SMGs<00:03:34.500> buffin<00:03:34.859> e<00:03:34.919> assault<00:03:35.220> rifles<00:03:35.639> that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
SMGs buffin e assault rifles that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.689 
SMGs buffin e assault rifles that
actually<00:03:36.599> might<00:03:36.930> work<00:03:37.199> quite<00:03:37.980> well<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.519> never

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
actually might work quite well you never

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.879 
actually might work quite well you never
know<00:03:38.849> and<00:03:39.180> i<00:03:40.019> would<00:03:40.139> actually<00:03:40.349> like<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> see

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
know and i would actually like to see

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.439 
know and i would actually like to see
that<00:03:41.010> happens<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.519> couple<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.849> salt<00:03:42.000> rifles<00:03:42.359> i

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
that happens a couple of salt rifles i

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.369 
that happens a couple of salt rifles i
think<00:03:42.660> should<00:03:42.750> be<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.900> little<00:03:43.169> bit<00:03:43.290> more

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
think should be a little bit more

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.520 
think should be a little bit more
powerful<00:03:43.859> just<00:03:44.459> my<00:03:44.579> opinion<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.389> then<00:03:46.169> if<00:03:46.379> you

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
powerful just my opinion and then if you

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.699 
powerful just my opinion and then if you
did<00:03:46.739> manner<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.879> SMG<00:03:48.209> guns<00:03:48.419> wouldn't<00:03:49.379> be<00:03:49.470> so

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
did manner the SMG guns wouldn't be so

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.830 
did manner the SMG guns wouldn't be so
bad<00:03:49.919> but<00:03:50.579> let<00:03:50.699> me<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.849> let<00:03:51.239> me<00:03:51.299> know<00:03:51.419> what<00:03:51.629> you

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
bad but let me know let me know what you

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.199 
bad but let me know let me know what you
think<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.169> this<00:03:52.319> i<00:03:52.739> wish<00:03:53.519> they<00:03:53.879> wouldn't<00:03:54.090> touch

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
think on this i wish they wouldn't touch

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.089 
think on this i wish they wouldn't touch
the<00:03:54.329> mp7<00:03:54.540> though<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:55.230> love<00:03:55.409> that<00:03:55.530> gun<00:03:55.739> just

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
the mp7 though just love that gun just

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.149 
the mp7 though just love that gun just
amazing<00:03:56.519> some<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.419> other<00:03:57.540> SMGs<00:03:58.290> can't

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
amazing some of the other SMGs can't

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.140 
amazing some of the other SMGs can't
think<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.340> any<00:03:59.459> was<00:03:59.579> taught<00:03:59.699> my<00:03:59.819> head<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.090> I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
think of any was taught my head but I

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.030 
think of any was taught my head but I
know<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.599> feel<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.900> them<00:04:01.169> could<00:04:01.470> do<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:01.799> maybe

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
know a feel of them could do with maybe

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.170 
know a feel of them could do with maybe
a<00:04:02.159> bit<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.400> buffing<00:04:02.699> because<00:04:02.849> they<00:04:02.909> are<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> bit

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
a bit of buffing because they are a bit

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.869 
a bit of buffing because they are a bit
overpowered<00:04:04.069> MSMC<00:04:05.069> maybe<00:04:05.459> could<00:04:05.669> do<00:04:05.730> with<00:04:05.849> a

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
overpowered MSMC maybe could do with a

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.180 
overpowered MSMC maybe could do with a
little<00:04:06.030> bit<00:04:06.299> but<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.349> mp7<00:04:07.560> i<00:04:07.799> think<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.069> quite

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
little bit but the mp7 i think is quite

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.159 
little bit but the mp7 i think is quite
balanced<00:04:08.609> it's<00:04:08.760> considerably<00:04:09.120> more<00:04:09.810> balanced

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
balanced it's considerably more balanced

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.449 
balanced it's considerably more balanced
and<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.349> was<00:04:10.440> intend<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:10.949> be<00:04:11.040> three<00:04:11.250> anyway

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and it was intend to be three anyway

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.819 
and it was intend to be three anyway
that's<00:04:11.669> for<00:04:11.849> sure<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.840> meanwhile<00:04:13.169> activision
