00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.049
 zdarova bandits with you because the panda 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 you are interested in the question who can kill 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.830
 of a midblade in midone do i suggest you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.389
 a guy who is definitely stronger than that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.740
 hero in general is definitely almost stronger 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.490
 all heroes in this mode 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 it is the lich king although in fact it is not 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 king but if you go out medan he flies 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 the real king is just a winner 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 of the winners first he lives creeps 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 without thereby giving the enemy farm 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.489
 it's very difficult especially from the very 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 start really rolling back this skill 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.219
 long enough at first but 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 less than the first wave of creeps can be washed 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.090
 completely mana he always has him not 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.309
 need team arcana here guys 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 tranquils collected ptshku he collected 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.890
 General arcana nafig not need because 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.180
 mana is always plenty and moreover drove away 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.820
 good frnobleblade distance 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 Perm scrap can safely be blown to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.129
 wear that litchi and did almost 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.420
 the very beginning and in general terrorlaid gift 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.190
 with its illusions even with its wild 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.589
 Damage with switching can not do anything 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.890
 make speeches more like that just 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.350
 gets level 6 you're surprised but in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360
 mass batch they have a huge 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 very strong advantage 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 terrorlade there is simply no chance and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 even these moments to Diana are kind of like 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.600
 they are trying to cut something now 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 by and large useless because 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 just still much stronger 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.289
 who could see the lich but maybe 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.810
 doom can do battle now thought 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.329
 probably it would be a good idea 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.729
 but only if the house has time for 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.789
 fucking man on a few few 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.030
 people because otherwise the kettle ulta is still 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.340
 will cut just a huge amount of damage 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.880
 because in a mass batch all the heroes 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.130
 stand next because it is only mid and 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 It is obvious that the Ultah has an hour 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.920
 many ok thanks for watching 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.000
 steam and origin is an excellent store where 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.069
 can buy times titanfall battlefield 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.550
 and much more go ssylochka in 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.550
