00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 Hi, all, how are you, girls? 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.539
 Well today we are going to make a brooch in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.030
 Kitten shape and has a little mouse 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.730
 inside kid 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.410
 it's very salty, it's very funny, the brooch 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.490
 I, whatever kittens are, makes me 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.500
 crazy at home I have two cats 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.900
 and good is very simple to do but 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.920
 I always try to explain everything 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.690
 I do with video because it's easier to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.400
 convey to us the way in which I work 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 or the way I do things 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.900
 for the craft you are going to need 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.260
 felt threads needles scissors and good in 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.990
 my page I'm going to leave this mold for you 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.840
 that you can download it and well what 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.730
 use as a base pattern if you would like 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.940
 the biggest kitten just does not 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.120
 you have to catch and make it bigger 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.070
 or even smaller than this one 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.820
 maybe you can take the image of 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.159
 make it more baby 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 Well, the girls are going to start 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090
 explain a little 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.450
 The first thing you are going to do is going to be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.680
 cut two pieces 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.650
 of the body of the cat 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 two pieces of the mouse's body 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.060
 from the rat or the little mouse 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 and a piece that is the one in the pocket by 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 true I forgot to tell you that I 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.579
 I put buttons then if you have four 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.670
 buttons at home because you can 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670
 use 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.760
 the first step is to decorate the part of 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.050
 above what the cat is 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.050
 that is all this part 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.830
 so I'm going to decorate it and now I 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.830
 I teach how it is worth 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.989
 once we have decorated the part of 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.989
 above the cat 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.880
 we have also decorated the part 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.250
 tiny mouse and we have attached it to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.340
 the other to the other employer 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.830
 with the shape of a mouse it would only be 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.060
 with being the mouse we give you a 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.370
 stitch to secure it and take the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 pocket where it was saved vale 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 let's do it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.730
 once we have cooked the mouse 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.500
 in your pocket what we are going to do is going to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.660
 be sew the back of the cat 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.620
 let's start the thing for this area of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.110
 here like this to the head and when 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.900
 we and what is her head 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.800
 we will put in a bit of wadding 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.800
 take volume 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.450
 can be wadding cotton pieces of cloth 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.400
 what you have at home that you see that 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.600
 can work to give volume and that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.950
 be soft that is not stiff 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.950
 Well let's meet 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.210
 well girls I have not caught anymore 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.220
 we have the kitten done 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.460
 and now the only thing that would be missing would be 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.870
 sew the safety pins 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.870
 if we pass it behind 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.990
 and we would have our brooch done 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.140
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.140
 bye
