00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
for some resources to start upgrading

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.690

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
up to level and the other three can now
start<00:00:30.810> making<00:00:31.289> Pyro's<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.369> that'll<00:00:32.700> help<00:00:32.790> save

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
start making Pyro's so that'll help save

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
start making Pyro's so that'll help save
some<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:34.590> trying<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.370> Pyro's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
some time if I'm trying to use my Pyro's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.959 
some time if I'm trying to use my Pyro's
in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.480> army<00:00:36.870> composition<00:00:37.670> because<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.879> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
in the army composition because if you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
in the army composition because if you
just<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.809> trying<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.290> an<00:00:40.379> army

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
just have one or trying to get an army

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
just have one or trying to get an army
full<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> Pyro's<00:00:41.280> gets<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.670> difficult

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
full of Pyro's gets very difficult

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.290 
full of Pyro's gets very difficult
because<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.540> take<00:00:42.719> too<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:43.020> time<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.469> make

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
because they take too much time to make

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
because they take too much time to make
we<00:00:45.300> still<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> research<00:00:46.350> lab<00:00:46.649> which<00:00:46.920> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
we still have the research lab which is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.150 
we still have the research lab which is
free<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.940> might<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> slashers<00:00:49.920> because

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
free I might do the slashers because

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.189 
free I might do the slashers because
they're<00:00:50.309> fairly<00:00:50.550> cheap<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> do

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they're fairly cheap but I do want to do

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.430 
they're fairly cheap but I do want to do
the<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.670> Pyro's<00:00:54.120> or<00:00:54.449> maybe<00:00:54.809> even<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.230> nurse

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the the Pyro's or maybe even the nurse

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.299 
the the Pyro's or maybe even the nurse
maybe<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.219> upgrade<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:58.010> but<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.219> see

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
maybe if I can upgrade it but let's see

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
maybe if I can upgrade it but let's see
how<00:00:59.399> much<00:00:59.520> resources<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
how much resources we can get in this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
how much resources we can get in this
episode<00:01:01.620> maybe<00:01:02.460> I'll<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> couple<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
episode maybe I'll do a couple of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.920 
episode maybe I'll do a couple of
attacks<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> slasher<00:01:05.369> or

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
attacks and see if we do the slasher or

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
attacks and see if we do the slasher or
the<00:01:06.930> rifleman<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the rifleman I do want to get the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
the rifleman I do want to get the
rifleman<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.680> reason<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
rifleman more because of the reason that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
rifleman more because of the reason that
I<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.939> rarely<00:01:12.330> ever<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I use them more I rarely ever use the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.950 
I use them more I rarely ever use the
slashers<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> even<00:01:15.119> though<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> slashers<00:01:15.750> are

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
slashers so even though the slashers are

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
slashers so even though the slashers are
less<00:01:16.290> expensive<00:01:16.860> upgrade<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> might<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.210> hold

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
less expensive upgrade I might just hold

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
less expensive upgrade I might just hold
off<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.680> oil<00:01:19.950> i<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
off and see how much oil i can get and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.539 
off and see how much oil i can get and
maybe<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.509> rifleman<00:01:21.960> instead

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
maybe just go for the rifleman instead

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.740 
maybe just go for the rifleman instead
so<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.729> guys<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.060> also<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.540> some

so as you guys can see also got some

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.950 
so as you guys can see also got some
additional<00:01:25.350> stars<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:26.100> completing<00:01:26.840> some<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

the campaign the single-player missions
which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> great<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.780> definitely<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.350> should

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
also keep doing that and it's a good way

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.280 
also keep doing that and it's a good way
to<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.500> diamonds<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> moving<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> the

some<00:01:43.560> reason<00:01:43.950> no<00:01:44.369> matter<00:01:44.549> where<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.820> finish

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
some reason no matter where you finish

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.490 
some reason no matter where you finish
it<00:01:45.329> shows<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> finished<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.259> fourth

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it shows that you finished in fourth

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
it shows that you finished in fourth
position<00:01:46.680> unless<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> are<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> top<00:01:47.850> three

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
position unless you are in the top three

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.179 
position unless you are in the top three
of<00:01:48.090> course<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:49.140> any<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.409> positions<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
of course but any other positions to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
of course but any other positions to
shows<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> finished<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.329> fourth<00:01:51.829> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
shows that is finished in fourth so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
shows that is finished in fourth so
hopefully<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.399> fix<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:54.090> bug<00:01:54.390> pretty

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
hopefully they can fix this bug pretty

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
you guys can see my old base is still

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.140 
you guys can see my old base is still
there<00:02:14.650> unfortunately<00:02:14.980> they<00:02:15.580> still<00:02:15.820> haven't

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
there unfortunately they still haven't

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
there unfortunately they still haven't
been<00:02:16.210> able<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.510> fix<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.990> even<00:02:17.380> though<00:02:17.500> they

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
been able to fix that even though they

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.220 
been able to fix that even though they
keep<00:02:17.800> claiming<00:02:18.070> that<00:02:18.400> they<00:02:18.640> have<00:02:19.230> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
keep claiming that they have it's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.200 
keep claiming that they have it's
probably<00:02:20.440> lying<00:02:20.770> somewhere<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.850> dark

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
probably lying somewhere in the dark

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.870 
probably lying somewhere in the dark
dark<00:02:22.750> edges<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.980> jungle<00:02:24.190> heat<00:02:24.430> servers

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
dark edges of the jungle heat servers

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.390 
dark edges of the jungle heat servers
and<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.230> go<00:02:26.410> into<00:02:26.530> my<00:02:26.710> clan<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:26.980> click<00:02:27.280> on

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
and if you go into my clan and click on

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.520 
and if you go into my clan and click on
it<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.820> still<00:02:28.120> there<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.470> definitely

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
it it's still there so it's definitely

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.240 
it it's still there so it's definitely
alive<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.730> i<00:02:31.120> still<00:02:31.360> cannot<00:02:31.630> access<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.250> at

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
alive but i still cannot access it at

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.650 
alive but i still cannot access it at
this<00:02:33.400> point<00:02:33.580> i've<00:02:33.760> pretty<00:02:33.910> much<00:02:33.970> given<00:02:34.090> up<00:02:34.480> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
this point i've pretty much given up on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.900 
this point i've pretty much given up on
it<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.110> no<00:02:35.770> point<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.190> talking<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
it so no point really talking about it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.990 
it so no point really talking about it
anymore<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.570> i<00:02:37.750> already<00:02:38.110> have<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> let's<00:02:39.880> get

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
anymore then i already have so let's get

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.780 
anymore then i already have so let's get
back<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> base<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.560> may<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> couple

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
back to the base and I may do a couple

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.070 
back to the base and I may do a couple
of<00:02:42.850> attacks<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.390> then<00:02:43.510> hopefully<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:43.960> can

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
of attacks and then hopefully we can

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.130 
of attacks and then hopefully we can
start<00:02:44.290> upgrading<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.950> these<00:02:45.160> walls<00:02:45.550> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
start upgrading some of these walls and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.180 
start upgrading some of these walls and
maybe<00:02:47.140> even<00:02:47.290> some<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.710> defensive

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
maybe even some of the defensive

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.360 
maybe even some of the defensive
buildings<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:49.240> have<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.890> let's<00:02:51.070> go<00:02:51.190> ahead<00:02:51.220> and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
buildings I have so let's go ahead and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.730 
buildings I have so let's go ahead and
see<00:02:51.460> what<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:51.970> find<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.960> this<00:02:56.230> first<00:02:56.410> base

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
see what we can find so this first base

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.270 
see what we can find so this first base
looks<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.520> pretty<00:02:57.700> decent<00:02:58.210> one<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.600> got<00:02:58.780> about

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
looks a pretty decent one it's got about

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.760 
looks a pretty decent one it's got about
230,000<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.430> resources<00:03:01.230> not<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> whole<00:03:02.530> lot

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
230,000 and resources not a whole lot

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.470 
230,000 and resources not a whole lot
but<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:03.820> decent<00:03:04.270> amount

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
but it's a pretty decent amount

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.700 
but it's a pretty decent amount
definitely<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.050> should<00:03:05.380> attack

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
definitely one you should attack

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.890 
definitely one you should attack
especially<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:07.030> most<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.630> resources

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
especially with most of the resources

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.920 
especially with most of the resources
being<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.190> collectors<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.570> can<00:03:10.720> try<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
being in the collectors you can try to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.860 
being in the collectors you can try to
just<00:03:11.260> go<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.430> attack<00:03:12.820> those<00:03:13.120> rather<00:03:13.420> than<00:03:13.630> I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
just go and attack those rather than I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.050 
just go and attack those rather than I
the<00:03:13.930> storages<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.520> what<00:03:15.640> I'm<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.880> try<00:03:16.030> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
the storages so what I'm going to try to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520 
the storages so what I'm going to try to
do<00:03:16.270> here<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.540> basically<00:03:16.840> looking<00:03:17.350> at<00:03:17.410> the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
do here is basically looking at the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.400 
do here is basically looking at the
defense's<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.490> can<00:03:18.640> see<00:03:18.820> as<00:03:19.420> most<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
defense's you can see as most of the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.620 
defense's you can see as most of the
collectors<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.160> outside<00:03:21.550> on<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.300> bottom

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
collectors on the outside on the bottom

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.940 
collectors on the outside on the bottom
right<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:22.930> bottom<00:03:23.380> left<00:03:23.770> so<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:26.410> defenses

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
right and bottom left so the defenses

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.650 
right and bottom left so the defenses
are<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.250> one<00:03:27.430> central<00:03:27.850> compartment<00:03:28.150> I'm<00:03:28.540> going

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
are in one central compartment I'm going

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.890 
are in one central compartment I'm going
to<00:03:28.720> try<00:03:28.840> to<00:03:28.870> get<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.560> mortar<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:31.720> my

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to try to get that to that mortar but my

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.380 
to try to get that to that mortar but my
Gunners<00:03:32.530> decide<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.010> walk<00:03:33.580> around<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.180> base

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
Gunners decide to walk around the base

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.740 
Gunners decide to walk around the base
and<00:03:34.750> go<00:03:35.740> for<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.100> cannon<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.850> that

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and go for that cannon and that

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.050 
and go for that cannon and that
Watchtower<00:03:38.230> instead<00:03:38.710> oh<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.670> I'm<00:03:39.790> gonna<00:03:39.910> have

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
Watchtower instead oh so I'm gonna have

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.390 
Watchtower instead oh so I'm gonna have
to<00:03:40.180> drop<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.750> some<00:03:40.960> more<00:03:41.200> wall<00:03:41.710> breakers<00:03:42.130> and

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
to drop in some more wall breakers and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
to drop in some more wall breakers and
see<00:03:42.490> if<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.850> get<00:03:43.000> in<00:03:43.150> through<00:03:43.300> there<00:03:43.600> and

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
see if I can get in through there and

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.500 
see if I can get in through there and
follow<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.070> up<00:03:45.130> with<00:03:45.250> some<00:03:45.610> riflemen<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:46.480> I

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
follow that up with some riflemen so I

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.870 
follow that up with some riflemen so I
can<00:03:46.720> take<00:03:46.870> these<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.140> couple<00:03:47.830> of<00:03:47.950> Defense's

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
can take these a couple of Defense's

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.480 
can take these a couple of Defense's
down<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.300> then<00:03:49.450> hopefully<00:03:50.080> my<00:03:50.230> Gunners<00:03:51.160> can

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
down and then hopefully my Gunners can

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.270 
down and then hopefully my Gunners can
start<00:03:51.820> focusing<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.450> that<00:03:52.570> mortar<00:03:53.020> next<00:03:53.530> it

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
start focusing on that mortar next it

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.060 
start focusing on that mortar next it
becomes<00:03:54.580> really<00:03:54.760> hard<00:03:55.120> playing<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:56.380> PC

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
becomes really hard playing this on a PC

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.010 
becomes really hard playing this on a PC
because<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.820> becomes<00:03:58.030> much<00:03:58.300> much<00:03:58.510> slower<00:03:58.660> than

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
because it becomes much much slower than

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.310 
because it becomes much much slower than
using<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.740> tablet<00:03:59.920> or<00:04:00.130> any<00:04:00.400> touchscreen<00:04:00.940> device

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
using a tablet or any touchscreen device

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.260 
using a tablet or any touchscreen device
so<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.380> kind<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.620> becomes<00:04:02.920> difficult<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:04.060> keep

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
so it kind of becomes difficult to keep

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.480 
so it kind of becomes difficult to keep
dropping<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:04.810> troops<00:04:05.080> at<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:06.040> speed<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.430> you

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
dropping in troops at the speed that you

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.590 
dropping in troops at the speed that you
want<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.060> do<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.380> PC<00:04:08.890> using<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.370> mouse<00:04:09.600> but

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
want to do on a PC using a mouse but

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.920 
want to do on a PC using a mouse but
that's<00:04:11.590> what<00:04:11.710> I'm<00:04:11.830> stuck<00:04:12.040> with<00:04:12.190> right<00:04:12.400> now<00:04:12.430> and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
that's what I'm stuck with right now and

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
that's what I'm stuck with right now and
let's<00:04:13.930> see<00:04:14.110> hopefully<00:04:14.380> if<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:14.920> future

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
let's see hopefully if in the future

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.120 
let's see hopefully if in the future
they<00:04:15.490> can<00:04:15.700> probably<00:04:16.450> link<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.989> account

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
they can probably link this account

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.700 
they can probably link this account
to<00:04:18.730> my<00:04:18.850> gmail<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:20.040> so<00:04:21.040> on<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.280> my<00:04:21.610> tablet

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710

gonna have to end up spending to get to

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.940 
gonna have to end up spending to get to
that<00:04:55.030> fifty<00:04:55.360> percent<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.900> might<00:04:56.170> not<00:04:56.380> do<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.620> but

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
that fifty percent I might not do it but

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.290 
that fifty percent I might not do it but
on<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.190> base<00:04:57.460> like<00:04:57.700> this<00:04:57.910> where<00:04:58.090> I'm<00:04:58.180> at

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
on a base like this where I'm at

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.510 
on a base like this where I'm at
forty-five<00:04:58.810> percent<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.950> do<00:05:00.010> have<00:05:00.310> some

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
forty-five percent and I do have some

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.100 
forty-five percent and I do have some
buildings<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.060> can<00:05:01.300> access<00:05:01.900> pretty

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
buildings that I can access pretty

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.900 
buildings that I can access pretty
easily<00:05:02.380> using<00:05:02.920> my<00:05:03.040> rifle<00:05:03.400> men<00:05:03.550> I'll

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
easily using my rifle men I'll

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.390 
easily using my rifle men I'll
definitely<00:05:04.270> go<00:05:04.690> ahead<00:05:04.900> with<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.140> and<00:05:05.590> try<00:05:06.340> to

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
definitely go ahead with that and try to

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.010 
definitely go ahead with that and try to
see<00:05:06.610> if<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:06.790> can<00:05:06.970> get<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.270> fifty<00:05:07.690> percent

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
see if I can get to that fifty percent

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.860 
see if I can get to that fifty percent
and<00:05:08.230> get<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.530> star<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:10.240> now<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.540> i'm<00:05:10.690> at

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
and get that star so now that i'm at

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.240 
and get that star so now that i'm at
fifty<00:05:11.290> percent<00:05:11.620> i<00:05:11.800> can<00:05:11.980> go<00:05:12.100> ahead<00:05:12.160> and

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
fifty percent i can go ahead and

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.190

and i'm going to go ahead and go back to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.020 
and i'm going to go ahead and go back to
base<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.720> maybe<00:05:32.440> figure<00:05:32.680> out<00:05:32.830> what<00:05:33.340> upgrades

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
base and maybe figure out what upgrades

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.150 
base and maybe figure out what upgrades
i<00:05:34.390> want<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.630> do<00:05:34.780> i'm<00:05:35.290> just<00:05:35.350> going<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.740> go<00:05:35.800> and

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
i want to do i'm just going to go and

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.950 
i want to do i'm just going to go and
stick<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.460> this<00:05:36.670> one<00:05:36.940> attack<00:05:37.270> for<00:05:37.540> this<00:05:37.690> video

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
stick to this one attack for this video

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.170 
stick to this one attack for this video
and<00:05:38.040> start<00:05:39.040> working<00:05:39.400> on<00:05:39.490> these<00:05:39.610> upgrades<00:05:39.820> for

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
and start working on these upgrades for

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.110 
and start working on these upgrades for
now<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.710> i<00:05:41.740> have<00:05:41.920> been<00:05:42.100> getting<00:05:42.520> attacked<00:05:42.970> from

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
now so i have been getting attacked from

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.110 
now so i have been getting attacked from
that<00:05:43.330> top<00:05:43.560> corner<00:05:44.560> and<00:05:44.770> what<00:05:45.670> i<00:05:45.700> want<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:45.970> do<00:05:46.090> is

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
that top corner and what i want to do is

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.270 
that top corner and what i want to do is
probably<00:05:46.570> upgrade<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.350> flame<00:05:47.620> tower<00:05:47.920> and

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
probably upgrade that flame tower and

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.050 
probably upgrade that flame tower and
maybe<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.640> cannon<00:05:49.150> or<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.950> cannons<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.880> the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
maybe a cannon or to the cannons and the

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.270 
maybe a cannon or to the cannons and the
watchtowers<00:05:52.540> are<00:05:52.660> good<00:05:52.930> unit<00:05:53.350> to<00:05:53.530> upgrade

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
watchtowers are good unit to upgrade

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.720 
watchtowers are good unit to upgrade
because<00:05:54.760> they<00:05:55.030> can<00:05:55.210> take<00:05:55.330> out<00:05:55.540> your<00:05:56.340> spies<00:05:57.340> and

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
because they can take out your spies and

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.300 
because they can take out your spies and
the<00:05:58.030> rifleman<00:05:58.450> in<00:05:58.510> just<00:05:58.810> a<00:05:58.930> single<00:05:59.080> shot<00:05:59.500> so

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
the rifleman in just a single shot so

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.350 
the rifleman in just a single shot so
you<00:06:00.400> definitely<00:06:00.580> want<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:00.970> keep<00:06:01.120> up<00:06:01.330> with

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
you definitely want to keep up with

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.750 
you definitely want to keep up with
upgrading<00:06:02.350> them<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.740> regular<00:06:02.950> basis<00:06:03.580> and

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
upgrading them on a regular basis and

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.570 
upgrading them on a regular basis and
get<00:06:03.910> them<00:06:04.060> up<00:06:04.210> as<00:06:04.480> high<00:06:04.750> as<00:06:04.960> possible<00:06:05.580> and

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
get them up as high as possible and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.580 
get them up as high as possible and
maybe<00:06:07.390> even<00:06:07.540> get<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.900> walls<00:06:08.110> on<00:06:08.320> the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
maybe even get the walls on the

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.140 
maybe even get the walls on the
perimeter<00:06:08.860> I<00:06:09.130> might<00:06:09.340> not<00:06:09.490> do<00:06:09.670> the<00:06:09.820> inside

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
perimeter I might not do the inside

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.880 
perimeter I might not do the inside
walls<00:06:10.450> I'll<00:06:10.780> start<00:06:11.050> working<00:06:11.200> on<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.530> walls<00:06:11.710> on

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
walls I'll start working on the walls on

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.990 
walls I'll start working on the walls on
the<00:06:12.010> outside<00:06:12.400> and<00:06:14.370> so<00:06:15.370> let's<00:06:15.670> go<00:06:15.820> ahead<00:06:15.850> with

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
the outside and so let's go ahead with

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.210 
the outside and so let's go ahead with
this<00:06:16.210> Watchtower<00:06:16.510> and<00:06:17.050> maybe<00:06:17.230> a<00:06:17.380> cannon<00:06:17.950> I

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
this Watchtower and maybe a cannon I

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.910 
this Watchtower and maybe a cannon I
don't<00:06:19.000> have<00:06:19.150> enough<00:06:19.390> to<00:06:20.230> do<00:06:20.380> a<00:06:20.410> couple<00:06:20.710> of

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
don't have enough to do a couple of

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.560 
don't have enough to do a couple of
mortars<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.640> I<00:06:21.730> don't<00:06:22.030> want<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.240> do<00:06:22.360> two<00:06:22.540> at

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
mortars and I don't want to do two at

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.080 
mortars and I don't want to do two at
the<00:06:22.690> same<00:06:22.960> time<00:06:23.200> because<00:06:23.550> they<00:06:24.550> help<00:06:24.760> protect

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
the same time because they help protect

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.959 
the same time because they help protect
against<00:06:25.420> the<00:06:25.570> Gunners<00:06:25.930> and

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
against the Gunners and

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.850 
against the Gunners and
down<00:06:27.149> many<00:06:27.659> units<00:06:27.959> at<00:06:28.139> the<00:06:28.229> same<00:06:28.409> time<00:06:28.619> because

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
down many units at the same time because

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.949 
down many units at the same time because
of<00:06:28.979> the<00:06:29.129> area<00:06:29.549> damage<00:06:29.759> so<00:06:30.569> I'll<00:06:30.629> just<00:06:30.659> go<00:06:30.869> ahead

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:30.959 
of the area damage so I'll just go ahead

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.109 
of the area damage so I'll just go ahead
with<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.349> flame<00:06:31.769> tower<00:06:32.039> of<00:06:32.339> watchtower<00:06:32.789> and<00:06:32.909> a

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:33.119 
with the flame tower of watchtower and a

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.749 
with the flame tower of watchtower and a
cannon<00:06:33.509> and<00:06:33.860> once<00:06:34.860> I<00:06:34.979> do<00:06:35.039> start<00:06:35.369> doing<00:06:35.669> that

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
cannon and once I do start doing that

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.549 
cannon and once I do start doing that
I'll<00:06:35.969> just<00:06:35.999> switch<00:06:36.719> the<00:06:36.749> two<00:06:37.049> flame<00:06:37.319> towers

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:37.559 
I'll just switch the two flame towers

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.589 
I'll just switch the two flame towers
and<00:06:38.309> the<00:06:38.339> reason<00:06:38.819> I'm<00:06:38.939> doing<00:06:39.089> this<00:06:39.239> is<00:06:39.360> because

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
and the reason I'm doing this is because

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.119 
and the reason I'm doing this is because
I've<00:06:39.869> been<00:06:40.019> getting<00:06:40.259> attacked<00:06:40.559> from<00:06:40.739> the<00:06:40.829> top

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
I've been getting attacked from the top

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.309 
I've been getting attacked from the top
side<00:06:41.399> so<00:06:41.999> I<00:06:42.029> don't<00:06:42.419> want<00:06:42.599> to<00:06:42.689> get<00:06:42.899> that<00:06:43.110> side

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
side so I don't want to get that side

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.100 
side so I don't want to get that side
weaker<00:06:43.679> by<00:06:43.860> taking<00:06:44.219> a<00:06:44.339> defense<00:06:44.809> away<00:06:45.809> from

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
weaker by taking a defense away from

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.739 
weaker by taking a defense away from
that<00:06:46.259> side<00:06:46.559> and<00:06:47.299> basically<00:06:48.299> getting<00:06:48.539> that

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:48.749 
that side and basically getting that

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.679 
that side and basically getting that
other<00:06:49.169> flame<00:06:49.619> tower<00:06:49.860> there<00:06:50.219> would<00:06:50.429> help

00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:50.689 
other flame tower there would help

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.969 
other flame tower there would help
protect<00:06:51.689> my<00:06:51.839> base<00:06:52.079> from<00:06:52.409> getting<00:06:52.709> attacked

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
protect my base from getting attacked

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.209 
protect my base from getting attacked
from<00:06:53.159> the<00:06:53.309> top<00:06:54.229> hopefully<00:06:55.229> at<00:06:55.319> least<00:06:55.349> you<00:06:56.069> know

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.219 
from the top hopefully at least you know
