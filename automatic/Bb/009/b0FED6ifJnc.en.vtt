00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.850 
and I think it's true it still is
something<00:02:13.210> I<00:02:13.300> could<00:02:13.480> take<00:02:13.690> Friday<00:02:14.080> that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
something I could take Friday that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.720 
something I could take Friday that
legislation<00:02:15.490> talked<00:02:16.480> about

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
legislation talked about

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.620 
legislation talked about
non-discrimination<00:02:20.010> accessibility

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
non-discrimination accessibility

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.290 
non-discrimination accessibility
inclusion<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.370> sweeping<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.150> its

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
inclusion and it was sweeping in its

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.560 
inclusion and it was sweeping in its
impact<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:27.069> there's<00:02:27.280> one<00:02:27.520> more<00:02:27.550> barrier<00:02:28.180> and

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
impact now there's one more barrier and

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.720 
impact now there's one more barrier and
I<00:02:28.630> presume<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.410> agree<00:02:29.770> with<00:02:30.010> me<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
I presume you agree with me that the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.760 
I presume you agree with me that the
next<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.390> perhaps<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.900> most<00:02:32.080> important

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
next and perhaps the most important

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.100 
next and perhaps the most important
barrier<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> see<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.630> people<00:02:34.870> with

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
barrier is to see that people with

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.500 
barrier is to see that people with
disabilities<00:02:35.830> get<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.280> chance<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> work

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
disabilities get a chance to go to work

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.830 
disabilities get a chance to go to work
you<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.470> can't<00:02:38.709> take<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.220> word<00:02:39.840> disability

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840

ago and you reflect on how important it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.140 
ago and you reflect on how important it
was<00:03:31.900> at<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.230> time<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.670> had<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> lot<00:03:34.000> of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
was at that time and you had a lot of

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.360 
was at that time and you had a lot of
people<00:03:34.480> involved<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:35.140> promoting<00:03:35.530> it<00:03:35.799> wasn't

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
people involved in promoting it wasn't

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.990 
people involved in promoting it wasn't
it<00:03:36.430> wonderful

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
it wonderful

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.180 
it wonderful
that<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.510> had<00:03:37.720> Republicans<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.739> Democrats

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that you had Republicans and Democrats

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.940 
that you had Republicans and Democrats
laying<00:03:39.970> out<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.239> platform<00:03:41.019> for<00:03:41.260> people<00:03:41.860> with

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
laying out that platform for people with

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.190 
laying out that platform for people with
disabilities<00:03:42.430> very<00:03:42.640> important<00:03:43.239> if<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.079> had

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
disabilities very important if it had

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.680 
disabilities very important if it had
been<00:03:44.350> just<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.829> party<00:03:45.340> kind<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.120> thing<00:03:46.180> you

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
been just one party kind of thing you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.550 
been just one party kind of thing you
know<00:03:46.720> would<00:03:47.140> have<00:03:47.230> been<00:03:48.070> less<00:03:48.310> effective<00:03:48.850> so

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
know would have been less effective so

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.610 
know would have been less effective so
no<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.590> think<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:51.310> think<00:03:51.579> it's<00:03:52.019> very<00:03:53.019> important

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
no I think I think it's very important

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.770 
no I think I think it's very important
if<00:03:53.709> there's<00:03:53.950> something<00:03:54.250> I'm<00:03:54.370> very<00:03:54.760> proud<00:03:55.660> of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.440 
natural human condition you know I think
people<00:04:22.660> have<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> wrong<00:04:23.979> impression<00:04:24.190> sometimes

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
people have a wrong impression sometimes

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.350 
people have a wrong impression sometimes
so<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.280> disability<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.820> they<00:04:28.000> think<00:04:28.240> well

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
so this disability and they think well

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080 
so this disability and they think well
that<00:04:28.680> personal<00:04:29.680> with<00:04:29.770> disability<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.640> less

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
that personal with disability is less

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.110 
that personal with disability is less
able<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.510> do<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.900> this<00:04:32.530> job<00:04:32.890> that's<00:04:33.640> not<00:04:33.730> fair

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
able to do this this job that's not fair

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.930 
able to do this this job that's not fair
that's<00:04:34.180> not<00:04:34.420> right<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:35.280> guess<00:04:36.280> at<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.700> end<00:04:36.730> of

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
that's not right I guess at the end of

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.330 
that's not right I guess at the end of
the<00:04:37.030> day<00:04:37.210> there<00:04:37.840> are<00:04:37.870> 40<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.770> 50<00:04:39.130> million

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
the day there are 40 to 50 million

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.420 
the day there are 40 to 50 million
Americans<00:04:39.780> who<00:04:40.780> have<00:04:40.990> far<00:04:41.470> more<00:04:41.680> opportunity

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430
