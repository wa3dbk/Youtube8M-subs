every<00:00:06.490> great<00:00:06.729> journey<00:00:07.200> begins<00:00:08.200> with<00:00:08.290> the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
every great journey begins with the

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.369 
every great journey begins with the
first<00:00:08.500> step<00:00:08.980> and<00:00:09.509> we<00:00:10.509> took<00:00:10.690> our<00:00:10.870> first<00:00:11.139> step

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:11.379 
first step and we took our first step

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.260 
first step and we took our first step
about<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.339> decade<00:00:12.759> ago<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:15.309> started<00:00:15.820> in<00:00:15.910> retail

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
about a decade ago we started in retail

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.600 
about a decade ago we started in retail
our<00:00:16.750> first<00:00:17.170> stores<00:00:17.530> were<00:00:17.890> kind<00:00:18.190> of<00:00:18.250> like<00:00:18.370> many

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
our first stores were kind of like many

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.460 
our first stores were kind of like many
retailers<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:19.510> know<00:00:19.630> they<00:00:20.200> were<00:00:20.260> your

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
retailers you know they were your

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.160 
retailers you know they were your
prototypical<00:00:20.950> stores<00:00:21.490> put<00:00:21.790> in<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.940> wall<00:00:22.170> then

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
prototypical stores put in a wall then

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.680 
prototypical stores put in a wall then
we<00:00:23.290> discovered<00:00:23.920> that<00:00:23.950> if<00:00:24.430> you<00:00:24.490> can<00:00:24.910> tailor<00:00:25.510> a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
we discovered that if you can tailor a

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.560 
we discovered that if you can tailor a
store<00:00:26.110> uniquely<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.980> its<00:00:27.160> setting<00:00:27.580> it<00:00:28.390> can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
store uniquely to its setting it can

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.050 
store uniquely to its setting it can
actually<00:00:28.720> improve<00:00:29.050> communities

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.600 

all<00:00:35.990> our<00:00:36.290> stores<00:00:36.650> have<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.070> same<00:00:37.310> elements

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
all our stores have the same elements

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.480 
all our stores have the same elements
but<00:00:38.180> what<00:00:39.110> sets<00:00:39.350> apart<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.950> significant

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
but what sets apart the significant

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.720 
but what sets apart the significant
stores<00:00:40.790> are<00:00:41.390> their<00:00:41.630> locations<00:00:42.520> which<00:00:43.520> are

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
stores are their locations which are

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.180 
stores are their locations which are
typically<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.720> most<00:00:44.900> important<00:00:45.710> in<00:00:45.860> that

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
typically the most important in that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.220 
typically the most important in that
city<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.840> architecture<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.960> about

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
city and the architecture it's about

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.340 
city and the architecture it's about
getting<00:00:51.560> out<00:00:51.830> into<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.730> street

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
getting out into the street

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.130 
getting out into the street
feeling<00:00:54.350> what<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.280> locals<00:00:55.700> feel<00:00:56.060> and<00:00:56.330> then

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
feeling what the locals feel and then

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.220 
feeling what the locals feel and then
trying<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.740> unlock<00:00:58.250> that<00:00:58.670> which<00:00:59.030> they<00:00:59.870> miss

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
trying to unlock that which they miss

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.130 
trying to unlock that which they miss
themselves<00:01:01.330> once<00:01:02.330> we<00:01:02.480> decide<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:02.990> right

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
themselves once we decide to the right

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.620 
themselves once we decide to the right
location<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.489> challenge<00:01:04.940> becomes<00:01:05.239> what<00:01:05.570> are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
location the challenge becomes what are

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.810 
location the challenge becomes what are
you<00:01:05.720> gonna<00:01:05.810> paint<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:06.500> what<00:01:07.190> kind<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.490> store
