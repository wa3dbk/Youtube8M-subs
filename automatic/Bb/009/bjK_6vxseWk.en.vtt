00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.770
 complicated the problem of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.689
 secure sites 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.280
 complexity the problem but we know 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.380
 that they have existed for a long time 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.670
 taking into account these problems and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.130
 it's been a long time since 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.810
 international companies that are struggling 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.030
 on a daily basis no risk is that they have 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.980
 stopped their activities and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.220

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.410
 with national security slots but 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.330
 vigilance is constant 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.059
 we know that this area is 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.629
 particularly targeted by terrorism 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.820
 creating new groups leave 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.190
 assume that the election without preparation 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 so yes to strengthening vigilance 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.509
 is constant and the strengthening of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.160
 eco measures then before leaving 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.210
 to pick up all this what are 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.580
 today the steps by which 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.869
 a business must go through to protect 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.810

 I will work what wrong and 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.320
 local or international partners in 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.330
 particularly in the energy field 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.729
 we no longer have a company working 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.580
 anyway safe and original company 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.319

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.550
 so there is first 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.960
