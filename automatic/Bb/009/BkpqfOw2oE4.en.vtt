00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.570 
and how big how big cuz you can put a
cat<00:03:11.390> or<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.630> dog<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:12.110> here<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:12.860> how<00:03:13.250> big<00:03:13.430> an

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
cat or a dog in here so how big an

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400 
cat or a dog in here so how big an
animal<00:03:13.970> maximum<00:03:14.720> would<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:14.989> put<00:03:15.140> into<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
animal maximum would you put into the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.490 
animal maximum would you put into the
larger<00:03:15.769> size<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.489> would<00:03:16.849> be<00:03:17.000> 15<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.170> 18

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
larger size this would be 15 to 18

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.520 
larger size this would be 15 to 18
minutes<00:03:18.739> 15<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.700> 18<00:03:20.030> pounds<00:03:20.209> ok<00:03:20.750> great

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
minutes 15 to 18 pounds ok great

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.229 
minutes 15 to 18 pounds ok great
which<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.860> pretty<00:03:22.099> good<00:03:22.310> size<00:03:22.489> you<00:03:22.819> know<00:03:22.940> dog

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
which is a pretty good size you know dog

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.270 
which is a pretty good size you know dog
or<00:03:23.569> obviously<00:03:24.080> almost<00:03:24.319> any<00:03:24.620> packet<00:03:25.040> fit<00:03:25.190> in

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
or obviously almost any packet fit in

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.640 
or obviously almost any packet fit in
here<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:25.940> then<00:03:26.510> we<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.319> smaller

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650
