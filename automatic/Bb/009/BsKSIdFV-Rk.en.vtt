fabric around a pole the fact that that

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.630 
fabric around a pole the fact that that
makes<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.269> these<00:00:15.480> zebra<00:00:16.170> stripes<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:17.430> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
makes is these zebra stripes kind of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.300 
makes is these zebra stripes kind of
effect<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:19.170> looks<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.470> complicated

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
effect and it looks really complicated

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.980 
effect and it looks really complicated
but<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.270> easy<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.750> make

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
but actually it's really easy to make

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.009 
but actually it's really easy to make
and<00:00:22.439> you'll<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:23.490> easy<00:00:23.760> pretty<00:00:24.180> soon<00:00:24.390> so

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and you'll see how easy pretty soon so

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.450 
and you'll see how easy pretty soon so
you<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.500> your<00:00:25.590> fabric<00:00:26.010> wet<00:00:26.220> as

you want to have your fabric wet as
usual<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:28.619> need<00:00:28.890> also<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.400> PVC<00:00:29.820> pipe<00:00:29.970> these

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
usual and you need also a PVC pipe these

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.389 
usual and you need also a PVC pipe these
are<00:00:30.929> pretty<00:00:31.109> easy<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.070> come<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
are pretty easy to get and they come in

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.810 
are pretty easy to get and they come in
different<00:00:32.430> sizes<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.899> get<00:00:34.230> them<00:00:34.590> wider<00:00:34.980> -

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
different sizes you can get them wider -

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.639 
different sizes you can get them wider -
pretty<00:00:36.030> narrow<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.660> different<00:00:37.230> size<00:00:37.380> will

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pretty narrow and different size will

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
pretty narrow and different size will
make<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.550> pattern<00:00:38.879> appear<00:00:39.180> differently<00:00:39.660> so

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
make the pattern appear differently so

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.430 
make the pattern appear differently so
you<00:00:40.050> want<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.469> start<00:00:41.309> placing<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.510> fabric<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you want to start placing your fabric in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.729 
you want to start placing your fabric in
the<00:00:43.770> pole<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> as<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.510> roll<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.230> want<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the pole and as you roll it you want to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
the pole and as you roll it you want to
be<00:00:46.969> scrunching<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> trying

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
be scrunching it so what are you trying

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.979 
be scrunching it so what are you trying
to<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.520> roll<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.480> fabric

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to do here is to roll all your fabric

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.500 
to do here is to roll all your fabric
around<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.559> pole<00:00:52.890> trying<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.789> avoid<00:00:54.149> having

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
around the pole trying to avoid having

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
around the pole trying to avoid having
layer<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.440> fabric<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> top<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.520> layer<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
layer of fabric on top of layer of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779 
layer of fabric on top of layer of
fabric<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.260> achieved<00:00:58.890> really<00:00:59.219> by<00:00:59.550> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
fabric so this is achieved really by as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.580 
fabric so this is achieved really by as
you<00:00:59.820> roll<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.890> just<00:01:04.250> continuing<00:01:05.250> scrunch<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
you roll it just continuing scrunch it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.810 
you roll it just continuing scrunch it
another<00:01:07.590> section<00:01:08.360> scrunching<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.820> suction

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
another section scrunching it suction

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.410 
another section scrunching it suction
screw<00:01:12.810> tunes

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.359 

so<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.630> end<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.960> have<00:01:22.990> your<00:01:23.710> fabric<00:01:23.950> all

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
so in the end you have your fabric all

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.790 
so in the end you have your fabric all
wrapped<00:01:24.909> around<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.540> pole<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.020> scrunch<00:01:26.619> it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
wrapped around the pole and scrunch it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.160 
wrapped around the pole and scrunch it
and<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.190> see<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.490> all<00:01:27.940> these<00:01:28.390> pleats<00:01:28.750> here

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
and you see that all these pleats here

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.810 
and you see that all these pleats here
that's<00:01:29.710> what<00:01:29.920> we're<00:01:30.070> going<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.400> make<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
that's what we're going to make the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.219 
that's what we're going to make the
zebra<00:01:31.300> kind<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.960> stripes<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:33.460> your<00:01:33.670> fabric<00:01:34.229> if

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
zebra kind of stripes in your fabric if

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.100 
zebra kind of stripes in your fabric if
you<00:01:35.290> dunking<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.400> into<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:36.970> dive<00:01:37.330> at<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:37.810> also

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you dunking this into a dive at you also

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.050 
you dunking this into a dive at you also
want<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.409> make<00:01:38.590> sure<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.220> remains<00:01:39.640> nice

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
want to make sure that it remains nice

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.450 
want to make sure that it remains nice
and<00:01:40.360> scrunch<00:01:40.690> like<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.500> can<00:01:41.800> wrap<00:01:42.190> it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
and scrunch like this so you can wrap it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.609 
and scrunch like this so you can wrap it
around<00:01:42.640> with<00:01:43.150> string<00:01:43.509> or<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.900> can<00:01:44.080> also<00:01:44.259> just

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
around with string or you can also just

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.969 
around with string or you can also just
use<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:45.250> couple<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.180> rubber<00:01:46.450> bands<00:01:46.979> throughout

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
use a couple of rubber bands throughout

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.240 
use a couple of rubber bands throughout
it<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.670> make<00:01:48.850> sure<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.509> it<00:01:49.860> stays<00:01:50.860> in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
it just to make sure that it stays in

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:03.960 
it just to make sure that it stays in
this<00:01:51.520> position<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:55.660> put<00:01:55.840> one<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.320> middle

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.609 

like<00:02:04.970> this<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.479> I'm<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:05.689> to<00:02:05.930> give<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.530> a

like this and I'm going to give it a

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.040 
like this and I'm going to give it a
final<00:02:07.539> scrunch<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:10.390> after<00:02:11.390> you're<00:02:11.540> done<00:02:11.690> you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.760 
final scrunch and after you're done you
just<00:02:12.319> dunk<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.099> on<00:02:13.459> your<00:02:13.760> dye<00:02:13.940> bath<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.770> you

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
just dunk it on your dye bath and you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.380 
just dunk it on your dye bath and you
want<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.069> make<00:02:16.220> sure<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.610> your<00:02:16.790> dye<00:02:16.940> bath<00:02:17.180> is

want to make sure that your dye bath is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900 
want to make sure that your dye bath is
deep<00:02:17.599> enough<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.830> fabric<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.459> totally

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
deep enough for the fabric to be totally

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.820 
deep enough for the fabric to be totally
submerged<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.319> leave<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.650> there

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
submerged and you just leave it there

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.729 
submerged and you just leave it there
for<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.430> hour<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.239> after<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.319> can
