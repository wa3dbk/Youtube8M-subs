00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
clearly I can see that this would be a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
clearly I can see that this would be a
bad<00:00:40.140> idea<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.640> beginning<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> summer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I'm a little more optimistic because

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.500

when you think about it in your head it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
when you think about it in your head it
sounds<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.289> perfect<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.829> oh<00:00:46.950> I'll<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.520> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
sure you guys know some things might

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.450 
sure you guys know some things might
seem<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.579> idea<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> time<00:01:03.690> but

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
seem like a good idea at the time but

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
seem like a good idea at the time but
then<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
then when you actually get down to it it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.820 
then when you actually get down to it it
turns<00:01:07.290> out<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.710> be<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.570> today<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.049> thought<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
turns out to be not so today I thought I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.130 
turns out to be not so today I thought I
would<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> video<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.360> reflective<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
would make a video that is reflective of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380
