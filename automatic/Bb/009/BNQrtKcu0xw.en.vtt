the Stargate in Stargate and oh boy it
is<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> hard<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is kind of hard to actually set up so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
is kind of hard to actually set up so
what<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.810> going

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.050 
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to<00:01:13.170> break<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> tend<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to break this one and if you tend to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
to break this one and if you tend to
break<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.780> tend<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> quite<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> big

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
break them they tend to do a quite a big

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
break them they tend to do a quite a big
of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> kaboom<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.080> over<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.680> now

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
of a kaboom like we have over here now

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
of a kaboom like we have over here now
this<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.430> somewhat<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.479> problem<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
this will be somewhat of a problem we

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
this will be somewhat of a problem we
can<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:22.920> walk<00:01:23.250> away<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> pretend<00:01:23.790> like

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
can just walk away and pretend like

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.780 
can just walk away and pretend like
nothing<00:01:24.390> happened<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.259> build<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.280> Stargate

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
nothing happened and build a Stargate

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
nothing happened and build a Stargate
somewhere<00:01:27.299> else<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
somewhere else but you can see that this

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.179 
somewhere else but you can see that this
Stargate<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.939> actually<00:01:30.930> closed<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:31.979> now

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
Stargate is actually closed off now

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.980 
Stargate is actually closed off now
because<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> main<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
because that one was the main one and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
because that one was the main one and
we'll<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.700> sister

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
we'll use this one as the sister

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.719 
we'll use this one as the sister
Stargate<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.470> brother<00:01:37.799> Stargate<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
Stargate or the brother Stargate and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.100 
Stargate or the brother Stargate and
we'll<00:01:38.909> connect<00:01:39.210> those<00:01:39.360> two<00:01:39.570> together<00:01:39.750> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we'll connect those two together so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.609 
we'll connect those two together so
let's<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> create<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.600> Stargate<00:01:43.320> now

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
let's go and create the Stargate now

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
let's go and create the Stargate now
you're<00:01:43.799> gonna<00:01:43.950> need<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.610> key<00:01:44.850> item<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> a

you're gonna need the key item is a
Stargate<00:01:45.960> controller<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.340> also<00:01:47.490> need<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.970> base

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
Stargate controller you also need a base

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.020 
Stargate controller you also need a base

in the form a link below it'll be

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
in the form a link below it'll be
absolutely<00:01:53.579> crazy<00:01:53.820> fire<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.540> through<00:01:54.780> all

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
absolutely crazy fire to go through all

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.649 
absolutely crazy fire to go through all
the<00:01:55.140> sort<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> links<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> crafting

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the sort of links or all the crafting

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.420 
the sort of links or all the crafting
recipes<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.619> absolutely<00:01:59.100> crazy

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
recipes because it is absolutely crazy

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.580 
recipes because it is absolutely crazy
but<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> nice<00:02:00.479> demonstration<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:01.560> how

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
but there is a nice demonstration on how

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.249 
but there is a nice demonstration on how
to<00:02:02.070> craft<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.729> actual<00:02:03.060> pole<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> off

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to craft the actual pole I know it off

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.419 
to craft the actual pole I know it off
by<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> memory<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:07.160> built<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
by a memory now it's actually built so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
by a memory now it's actually built so
many<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.879> these<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.869> actually

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
many of these now that it's actually

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.589 
many of these now that it's actually
quite<00:02:10.470> crazy<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.879> go<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.390> switch

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
quite crazy and there we go just switch

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.380 
quite crazy and there we go just switch
that<00:02:12.629> up

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
that up

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.059 
that up
there<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.720> go<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.290> once<00:02:14.500> you've<00:02:14.620> done<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.830> in

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
there we go and once you've done that in

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.130 
there we go and once you've done that in
that<00:02:15.220> formation<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:16.360> all<00:02:16.569> met<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.020> will

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that formation it all met it will

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.770 
that formation it all met it will
automatically<00:02:17.800> change<00:02:18.100> into<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> circle<00:02:19.450> now

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
automatically change into a circle now

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.110 
automatically change into a circle now
it<00:02:20.020> won't<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> war<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.830> war<00:02:21.160> patient<00:02:21.910> or

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it won't get the war a war patient or

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.020 
it won't get the war a war patient or
the<00:02:22.840> nice<00:02:23.200> portal<00:02:24.040> effect<00:02:24.400> what<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:24.819> need<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the nice portal effect what we need to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.699 
the nice portal effect what we need to
do<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.270> place<00:02:25.480> down<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> Stargate<00:02:26.230> control<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
do is place down the Stargate control it

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.970 
do is place down the Stargate control it
can<00:02:26.770> be<00:02:26.920> placed<00:02:27.130> anywhere<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:28.270> four<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.720> five

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
can be placed anywhere in a four to five

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.050 
can be placed anywhere in a four to five
block<00:02:29.980> radius<00:02:30.010> I'm<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.700> gonna<00:02:30.790> place<00:02:31.030> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
block radius I'm just gonna place it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.600 
block radius I'm just gonna place it
here<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.750> before<00:02:32.470> we<00:02:32.560> do<00:02:32.680> anything<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:33.580> need

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
here and before we do anything we need

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.690 
here and before we do anything we need
to<00:02:33.940> right-click<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.140> Stargate<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
to right-click the Stargate and get the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.910 
to right-click the Stargate and get the
address<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.330> also<00:02:37.750> fuel<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.410> up<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.740> it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
address and also fuel it up so it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.290 
address and also fuel it up so it
actually<00:02:39.100> uses<00:02:39.520> some<00:02:39.760> lucky<00:02:40.390> word<00:02:41.819> fuel<00:02:42.819> sorry

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
actually uses some lucky word fuel sorry

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.000 
actually uses some lucky word fuel sorry
if<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.540> pronounced<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:44.080> wrong<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:44.890> also

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
if I pronounced that wrong and you also

if I pronounced that wrong and you also
got<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.280> take<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.459> look<00:02:45.730> at<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> address<00:02:46.360> it's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
got to take a look at the address it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.229 
got to take a look at the address it's
an<00:02:46.720> AI<00:02:47.050> z<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:48.209> D<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.470> BA<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.640> should<00:02:52.000> write<00:02:52.209> that

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
an AI z I D and BA you should write that

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:52.890 
an AI z I D and BA you should write that
down

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
down

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.660

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
written down the a travel teleport and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.580 
written down the a travel teleport and
actually<00:03:00.280> what<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> should<00:03:00.970> do<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.870> I'm

actually gonna write this down I've got
a<00:03:03.790> piece<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.120> paper<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.690> pen<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.380> alright<00:03:05.739> i

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
a piece of paper and a pen so alright i

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.120 
a piece of paper and a pen so alright i
zi<00:03:06.959> d<00:03:09.030> n-b-a<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.630> course<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.560> remember<00:03:11.860> it

but i'm doing so many things at once
that<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> absolutely<00:03:15.430> crazy<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.300> IC<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.050> D

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
that is absolutely crazy so it's IC I D

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.520 
that is absolutely crazy so it's IC I D
n<00:03:19.530> ba<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.070> if<00:03:21.310> all<00:03:21.489> goes<00:03:21.519> good<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.959> should<00:03:23.290> work

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
n ba and if all goes good it should work

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.259 
n ba and if all goes good it should work
alright<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.160> can<00:03:24.340> hear<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.700> sound<00:03:24.910> effects

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
alright you can hear the sound effects

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.520 
alright you can hear the sound effects
it's<00:03:25.750> actually<00:03:26.140> working

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
it's actually working

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.199 
it's actually working
yeah<00:03:26.739> I've<00:03:26.980> actually<00:03:27.060> allocated<00:03:28.060> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
yeah I've actually allocated the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.539 
yeah I've actually allocated the
Stargate<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.959> go<00:03:29.290> traveling<00:03:29.890> back<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> my

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
Stargate to go traveling back to my

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.030 
Stargate to go traveling back to my
Stargate<00:03:31.200> nothing<00:03:32.200> that's<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.590> back<00:03:33.010> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
Stargate nothing that's so back to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.370 
Stargate nothing that's so back to
travel<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.549> this<00:03:33.670> one<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.350> I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
travel to this one so this was what I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.280 
travel to this one so this was what I
was<00:03:35.620> doing<00:03:36.010> before<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.690> wasn't<00:03:37.989> really

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
was doing before and it wasn't really

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.810 
was doing before and it wasn't really
working<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.920> really<00:03:39.130> didn't<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.519> hang<00:03:39.700> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
working I really didn't have the hang of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.400 
working I really didn't have the hang of
it<00:03:39.940> but<00:03:40.090> after<00:03:40.420> our<00:03:40.540> research<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.260> was

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
it but after our research and that was

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.840 
it but after our research and that was
the<00:03:41.530> cool<00:03:41.739> warp<00:03:41.980> effect<00:03:42.100> if<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.579> were<00:03:42.730> in

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
the cool warp effect if you were in

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.490 
the cool warp effect if you were in
survival<00:03:43.360> mode<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.840> would<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.140> killed<00:03:44.380> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
survival mode that would have killed you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.340 
survival mode that would have killed you
if<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.799> were<00:03:44.860> in<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.250> 5<00:03:45.840> distance<00:03:46.840> radius<00:03:47.230> of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that and if I go into here what I'll do

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.940 
that and if I go into here what I'll do
is<00:03:49.570> send<00:03:49.810> me<00:03:49.870> right<00:03:50.079> back<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:50.560> in<00:03:50.709> the

filled up with that Fumi and what I want

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.360 
filled up with that Fumi and what I want
to<00:04:33.449> do<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:33.659> switch<00:04:33.900> over<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.229> there<00:04:34.889> we<00:04:35.009> go<00:04:35.159> I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
to do is switch over to there we go I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.580 
to do is switch over to there we go I
switched<00:04:35.849> over<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.360> right<00:04:37.020> right<00:04:37.409> the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
switched over to the right right the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.610 
switched over to the right right the
last<00:04:37.710> moment<00:04:38.189> I<00:04:38.280> put<00:04:38.520> mail<00:04:38.729> was<00:04:38.909> torn<00:04:39.719> apart<00:04:39.900> by

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
last moment I put mail was torn apart by

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.610 
last moment I put mail was torn apart by
an<00:04:40.740> event<00:04:40.909> by<00:04:41.909> an<00:04:42.210> event<00:04:42.539> horizon<00:04:43.139> alright<00:04:43.439> so

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
an event by an event horizon alright so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.080 
an event by an event horizon alright so
what<00:04:43.740> we're<00:04:43.860> gonna<00:04:43.949> do<00:04:44.099> is<00:04:44.370> when<00:04:44.699> I<00:04:44.729> quickly

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
what we're gonna do is when I quickly

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.790 
what we're gonna do is when I quickly
run<00:04:45.360> over<00:04:45.569> to<00:04:45.719> this<00:04:45.840> star<00:04:46.229> gate<00:04:46.439> and<00:04:46.650> we're

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
run over to this star gate and we're

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.619 
run over to this star gate and we're
gonna<00:04:46.919> teleport<00:04:47.580> through<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> next<00:04:48.360> one

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
gonna teleport through to the next one

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.230 
gonna teleport through to the next one
so<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.289> just<00:04:49.469> adds<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:49.919> a<00:04:50.099> cool<00:04:50.370> teleportation

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
so it just adds in a cool teleportation

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.790 
so it just adds in a cool teleportation
device<00:04:51.509> into<00:04:51.870> my<00:04:52.050> craft<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.469> there<00:04:52.590> we<00:04:52.680> go

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
device into my craft and there we go

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.350 
device into my craft and there we go
we've<00:04:52.979> teleport<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.610> we<00:04:53.699> can<00:04:53.879> pick<00:04:54.060> up<00:04:54.210> all

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
we've teleport and we can pick up all

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.749 
we've teleport and we can pick up all
that<00:04:54.509> stuff<00:04:54.569> back<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.319> voila<00:04:56.069> you<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.610> just

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
that stuff back and voila you can just

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.309 
that stuff back and voila you can just
go<00:04:56.909> teleport<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.719> out<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:58.020> have<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.229> go

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
go teleport in and out you have to go

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.459 
go teleport in and out you have to go
through<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.620> middle<00:04:59.039> and<00:04:59.400> there<00:04:59.909> we<00:05:00.030> go<00:05:00.469> this

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
through that middle and there we go this

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.260 
through that middle and there we go this
pretty<00:05:01.680> much<00:05:01.830> covers<00:05:02.069> the<00:05:02.370> entire<00:05:02.639> Stargate

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
pretty much covers the entire Stargate

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.320 
pretty much covers the entire Stargate
