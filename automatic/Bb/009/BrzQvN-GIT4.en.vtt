00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.009
 to a new video of game with me 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.440
 toys 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.510
 I have a variety today 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.000
 smart knead for you last time 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.389
 was that the super scarab flip flop 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.210
 knead intelligent and today poverty 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.070
 that is supposed to change the color 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 i believe all the other features has 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720
 This intelligent knead therefore also 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.750
 a special highlight here are the enders 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.920
 stretcher color I'm curious and we 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.219
 open the box and it's on 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:44.070
 strong purple but a bit 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.840
 pastel-like and very very tough so the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 scarab became somehow easier 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.820
 remove from the pack 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 maybe the dough is easy too 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.609
 a bit too cool but I can manage that 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.739
 really knead very very bad 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.250
 I can cut my ring off the problem 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.250
 that again 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:31.700
 biggest effort here right now 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:41.119
 once in a piece I get the kneading 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:42.799
 In any case, do not go out very much 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.149
 strangely i thought that all this 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.590
 knead varieties of consistency pretty much 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.319
 You can definitely do it the same way 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.990
 we'll get ripped out of the pack 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.170
 it is not now but prior to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.149
 effect anyway that is a bit 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.149
 We were able to break it out, after all 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.030
 Now I'm curious about heat 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.190
 should the dough change color 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 from this purple in a pink maybe 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.480
 I should split the piece two 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 So we have a direct comparison 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.390
 So the right part does not hold now 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.430
 more and I try the left one now 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.850
 my ice cold back warm 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.850
 knead 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.860
 I still do not see a difference 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.250
 but maybe you would need one too 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.250
 greater heat effect 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:15.900
 can be bit in the hands and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.900
 that brings something nee 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.670
 I think I'll be a bit 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.010
 boil water 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.870
 So here we are our two pieces 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.580
 with is from the smart kneading series 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.250
 and left we have the cold water and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.190
 on the right the warm one I will just now 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.560
 the dough is a bit flatter 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.560
 make and insert here 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.080
 the man definitely needs one 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:54.020
 slightly higher temperatures with the 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.060
 Hands can not discolor this 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.200
 but I have here now 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.100
 I think so between boys 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.510
 for 50 degrees I guess 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.160
 water temperature and you can see clearly 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.459
 here in direct comparison that the 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.570
 Dabbed now I do it 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.709
 back to the cold water 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.130
 but maybe you would need it too 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.210
 something like water once you see 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 already that the kneading a bit 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.419
 gets darker 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.510
 I show that again who is here 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.979
 Leash and knead as soon as they touch 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.979
 with the warm water comes 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.550
 she changes color I'll go now 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.389
 a half 0 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.389
 make pink and leave the other songs 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.600
 with them you can see again right 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:03.180
 beautiful 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.560
 pretty cool before and after 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.660
 I do not know how that works 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.780
 always try such things for me 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.960
 explain and here you can already see that 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.040
 the left kneading is already patience 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.270
 So actually again league 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.400
 when you turn it into cold 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.990
 water does 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.810
 and here she is quite helping left the 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.419
 poverty is smart play and cold 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.190
 water and right knead the same 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.080
 however in the warm water 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.580
 I hope my little review has you 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.320
 fallen or smart kneeled 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.030
 give me a thumbs up 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.740
 leave me a nice comment 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.449
 and of course do not forget the channel 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.590
 to subscribe like sinus then to 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.590
 next time bye
