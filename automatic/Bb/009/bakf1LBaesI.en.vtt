00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.949 
tutorial on how to photograph water
droplets<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.530> basically<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:14.070> I've<00:00:14.219> used<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:14.959 
droplets and basically what I've used is

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.290 
droplets and basically what I've used is
for<00:00:15.959> lighting<00:00:16.289> firstly<00:00:16.860> is<00:00:17.300> boeing's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
for lighting firstly is boeing's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.089 
for lighting firstly is boeing's
umbrella<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.810> transparent<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.980> using<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.009> as

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
umbrella and transparent and using it as

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.499 
umbrella and transparent and using it as
a<00:00:23.160> shoot<00:00:23.490> through<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.300> basically<00:00:24.929> when<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.769> fire

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
a shoot through so basically when I fire

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.380 
a shoot through so basically when I fire
shut<00:00:27.509> the<00:00:27.630> trigger<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.140> my<00:00:28.349> camera<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:30.150> will

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
shut the trigger on my camera it will

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
shut the trigger on my camera it will
fire<00:00:30.839> the<00:00:30.990> flesh<00:00:31.259> on<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.099> umbrella<00:00:32.400> as<00:00:32.700> well

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
fire the flesh on the umbrella as well

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.140 
fire the flesh on the umbrella as well
as<00:00:33.060> getting<00:00:33.240> this<00:00:33.450> constant<00:00:34.670> light<00:00:35.670> through

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
as getting this constant light through

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.040 
as getting this constant light through
the<00:00:36.180> modeling<00:00:36.989> lamp<00:00:37.230> um<00:00:37.879> that's<00:00:39.050> wirelessly

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the modeling lamp um that's wirelessly

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.189 
the modeling lamp um that's wirelessly
connected<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:43.379> transmitter<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
connected to this transmitter so that

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.470 
connected to this transmitter so that
basically<00:00:46.730> minimizes<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> cables<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
basically minimizes the cables on the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
basically minimizes the cables on the
floor<00:00:48.949> I'm<00:00:49.949> just<00:00:50.100> using<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.730> camera<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
floor I'm just using the camera of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
with a aperture of 2.8 but I've been

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.000 
with a aperture of 2.8 but I've been
able<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> smaller<00:01:01.260> aperture<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.460> 8<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
able to use a smaller aperture of 8 and

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.830 
able to use a smaller aperture of 8 and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
shutter speed of 250 eighth of a second
and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.890> hundred<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:11.970> has<00:01:12.180> given<00:01:12.450> me

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and I so a hundred which has given me

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.280 
and I so a hundred which has given me
and<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> shots<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.640> I've<00:01:14.850> been<00:01:15.060> after<00:01:15.420> I'm

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and the shots that I've been after I'm

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.120 
and the shots that I've been after I'm
just<00:01:16.470> using<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.040> glass<00:01:17.280> bowl<00:01:18.140> with<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> vinyl<00:01:19.950> mat

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
just using a glass bowl with a vinyl mat

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.200 
just using a glass bowl with a vinyl mat
underneath<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> obviously<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.760> Walter

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
underneath so that obviously with Walter

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.150 
underneath so that obviously with Walter
it<00:01:24.450> will<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.690> mop<00:01:24.870> up<00:01:25.020> nicely<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:26.040> also

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
it will just mop up nicely and I'm also

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.970 
it will just mop up nicely and I'm also
getting<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.760> nice<00:01:26.880> green<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.680> background<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
getting a nice green and background in

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.060 
getting a nice green and background in
the<00:01:29.070> shots<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.520> well<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:30.480> I<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.440> basically

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the shots as well and I then basically

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.500 
the shots as well and I then basically
just<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.760> a<00:01:32.790> bag<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.930> water<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.730> place

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
just have a bag of water like so I place

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.650 
just have a bag of water like so I place
there<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.500> foot<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.980> a<00:01:38.010> half<00:01:38.270> above<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
there about foot and a half above the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.690 
there about foot and a half above the
bold<00:01:39.870> water<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.560> there's<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.220> small<00:01:41.490> little

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
bold water and there's a small little

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
bold water and there's a small little
hole<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.300> obviously<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:42.720> getting<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.960> steady

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hole and obviously I'm getting a steady

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
hole and obviously I'm getting a steady
flow<00:01:43.410> of<00:01:43.500> drips<00:01:43.800> there<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.240> can

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
flow of drips there and then I can

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.460 
flow of drips there and then I can
basically<00:01:47.300> with<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.570> manner<00:01:48.810> right

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
basically with the right manner right

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
basically with the right manner right
timing<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.100> being<00:01:51.090> able<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.330> get<00:01:51.450> some<00:01:51.660> shots

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
timing and being able to get some shots

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
timing and being able to get some shots
and<00:01:52.280> quite<00:01:53.280> effective<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.140> I've<00:01:55.440> then<00:01:56.810> just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
and quite effective and I've then just

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.390 
and quite effective and I've then just
to<00:01:57.990> make<00:01:58.350> sure<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.650> focusing<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> right

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
to make sure you're focusing the right

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.220 
to make sure you're focusing the right
point<00:01:59.610> obviously<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.900> in<00:02:00.990> for

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
point obviously you want to be in for

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.160 
point obviously you want to be in for
manual<00:02:01.590> mode<00:02:01.800> and<00:02:02.040> manual<00:02:02.640> focus<00:02:03.090> put<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:03.930> knife

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
manual mode and manual focus put a knife

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.860 
manual mode and manual focus put a knife
in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> middle<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.980> bowl<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.360> then

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
in the middle of the bowl and then

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.389 
in the middle of the bowl and then
basically<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.440> allows<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.920> why<00:02:08.220> you're

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
basically that allows you to why you're

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.190 
basically that allows you to why you're
holding<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.989> then

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
holding that there you can then

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.360 
holding that there you can then
obviously<00:02:12.170> focus<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.530> your<00:02:13.709> focusing<00:02:14.159> ring

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
obviously focus in on your focusing ring

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.699 
obviously focus in on your focusing ring
and<00:02:14.689> so<00:02:15.689> that<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.049> make<00:02:16.230> sure<00:02:16.439> you're

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
and so that you can make sure you're

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.350 
and so that you can make sure you're
getting<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.189> right

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
getting the right

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.900 
getting the right
point<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> bowl<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.670> obviously<00:02:20.670> whenever

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
point in the bowl and obviously whenever

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.320 
point in the bowl and obviously whenever
you<00:02:21.180> move<00:02:22.460> your<00:02:23.460> tripod<00:02:23.850> or<00:02:23.970> anything<00:02:24.240> you

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
you move your tripod or anything you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.690 
you move your tripod or anything you
need<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:24.720> sure<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.550> fix<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
need to make sure that you fix that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.410 
need to make sure that you fix that
focus<00:02:27.240> point<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.660> again<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.020> well<00:02:29.240> that's<00:02:30.240> our

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
focus point in again as well that's our
