00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
alright a little update on what I found

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.100 
alright a little update on what I found
and<00:00:05.540> what<00:00:06.540> I've<00:00:06.690> been<00:00:06.779> making<00:00:07.429> recently<00:00:09.110> so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and what I've been making recently so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.589 
and what I've been making recently so
start<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.830> find<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.210> some<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
start with the find here are some of the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.939 
start with the find here are some of the
major<00:00:12.840> ones<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.549> other<00:00:14.549> than<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.949> fragments

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
major ones and other than the fragments

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.210 
major ones and other than the fragments
and<00:00:17.070> shrapnel<00:00:18.109> then<00:00:19.109> those<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:19.949> sitting

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and shrapnel then those are just sitting

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.790 
and shrapnel then those are just sitting
in<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.520> garage<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.810> you've<00:00:22.500> already

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
in a garage right now but you've already

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.439 
in a garage right now but you've already
seen<00:00:22.980> those<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.490> previous<00:00:24.029> videos

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
seen those in the previous videos

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
seen those in the previous videos
hopefully<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> yeah<00:00:26.689> most<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> these<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.580> some

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
hopefully so yeah most of these are some

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
hopefully so yeah most of these are some
of<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:30.000> today's<00:00:30.269> find<00:00:30.599> like<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.470> show

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
of these are today's find like this show

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.410 
of these are today's find like this show
or<00:00:32.149> a<00:00:33.149> third<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> shell<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.059> yeah<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.270> this

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
or a third of a shell and yeah so this

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
or a third of a shell and yeah so this
is<00:00:36.510> another<00:00:37.340> shrapnel<00:00:38.340> shell<00:00:38.579> which<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.480> some

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
is another shrapnel shell which for some

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.979 
is another shrapnel shell which for some
reason<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:40.079> looks<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.620> well<00:00:40.920> exploded<00:00:41.989> but

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
reason it looks like well exploded but

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
reason it looks like well exploded but
yeah<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:43.829> has<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> rotating

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
yeah this one actually has a rotating

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.369 
yeah this one actually has a rotating
been<00:00:44.789> fully<00:00:45.090> intact<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> thought<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> was

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
been fully intact so I thought that was

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619 
been fully intact so I thought that was
pretty<00:00:46.500> cool<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.879> again<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.450> sitting

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
pretty cool and again I was just sitting

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.819 
pretty cool and again I was just sitting
on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.809> surface<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:51.530> here's<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:54.829> nose

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
on the surface and here's a little nose

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.400 
on the surface and here's a little nose
cone<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.120> probably<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.020> high<00:00:58.260> explosive

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
cone of a probably a high explosive

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
cone of a probably a high explosive
shell<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> tells<00:01:01.559> me<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
shell but what this tells me is that the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.770 
shell but what this tells me is that the
shell<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.949> using<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.400> base<00:01:05.580> plug<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.540> base

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
shell was using a base plug or the base

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
shell was using a base plug or the base
views<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> fuse<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> screwed

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
views so the fuse will be on the screwed

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.469 
views so the fuse will be on the screwed
in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.780> bottom<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> show<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.479> also

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
in the very bottom of the show and also

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109 
in the very bottom of the show and also
it<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.689> probably<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> timer<00:01:13.890> based<00:01:14.280> since<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it was probably a timer based since this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
it was probably a timer based since this
was<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.600> sitting<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> nowhere<00:01:16.350> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
was just sitting out in the nowhere so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.859 
was just sitting out in the nowhere so
it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.009> probably<00:01:17.220> area<00:01:17.610> aerial<00:01:18.270> explosion

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it was probably area aerial explosion

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.030 
it was probably area aerial explosion
caused<00:01:19.500> us<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.770> fly<00:01:19.950> somewhere<00:01:20.189> else<00:01:20.430> from<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
caused us to fly somewhere else from the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.039 
caused us to fly somewhere else from the
detonation<00:01:23.040> site<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.780> it's<00:01:24.780> still<00:01:24.930> pretty

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
detonation site so it's still pretty

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
detonation site so it's still pretty
cool<00:01:26.750> it's<00:01:27.750> very<00:01:27.900> heavy<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
cool it's very heavy actually and this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.499 
cool it's very heavy actually and this
one<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.369> lucky<00:01:32.670> find<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
one right here is a lucky find it's a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.190 
one right here is a lucky find it's a
flash<00:01:34.110> tube<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.890> shrapnel<00:01:35.460> shell<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.200> if

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
flash tube for the shrapnel shell and if

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630 
flash tube for the shrapnel shell and if
you<00:01:37.290> haven't<00:01:37.530> seen<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> previous<00:01:38.070> video<00:01:38.430> what

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you haven't seen the previous video what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
you haven't seen the previous video what
it<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.880> basically<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.810> tube<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.200> runs

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it is basically a little tube that runs

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
it is basically a little tube that runs
in<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> middle<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> show<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.700> shrapnel

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
in the middle of the show a shrapnel

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.410 
in the middle of the show a shrapnel
shell<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.920> carry<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> flash<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> combustion

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
shell to carry a flash or a combustion

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.859 
shell to carry a flash or a combustion
from<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> fuse<00:01:46.439> down<00:01:47.240> into<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> powder<00:01:48.509> dump

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
from the fuse down into the powder dump

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.889 
from the fuse down into the powder dump
which<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.740> right<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.750> will

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
which is that right there so this will

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
which is that right there so this will
be<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.350> stuck<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.149> base<00:01:54.780> plate<00:01:55.490> or

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
be just like stuck on the base plate or

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
be just like stuck on the base plate or
the<00:01:56.549> piston<00:01:57.149> whatever<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> call<00:01:57.750> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
the piston whatever you want to call it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
the piston whatever you want to call it
like<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.570> sitting

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
like that you know this will be sitting

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.880 
like that you know this will be sitting
in<00:02:00.990> there

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.910 

oh<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:05.570> doesn't<00:02:05.720> fit<00:02:06.020> because<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.710> rest

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
oh it doesn't fit because all the rest

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.700 
oh it doesn't fit because all the rest
but<00:02:07.159> you<00:02:07.940> get<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.119> idea<00:02:08.209> I<00:02:08.420> just

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
but you get the idea I just

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.730 
but you get the idea I just
the<00:02:10.510> black<00:02:11.510> powder<00:02:11.720> will<00:02:11.960> combust<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the black powder will combust and you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.730 
the black powder will combust and you
know<00:02:12.860> forces<00:02:13.520> thing<00:02:13.730> out<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> big<00:02:15.410> shot

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
know forces thing out like a big shot

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.570 
know forces thing out like a big shot
gun<00:02:15.980> show<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:18.260> that's<00:02:18.770> pretty<00:02:18.980> cool<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:21.580> hear

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
gun show so that's pretty cool and hear

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.950 
gun show so that's pretty cool and hear
more<00:02:22.940> more<00:02:23.570> these<00:02:23.870> components<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.750> one

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
more more these components and this one

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.860 
more more these components and this one
in<00:02:27.080> particular<00:02:27.400> has<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.640> firing<00:02:29.060> pin<00:02:29.270> exposed

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
in particular has the firing pin exposed

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.800 
in particular has the firing pin exposed
which<00:02:30.200> indicates<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.580> shell<00:02:31.910> detonated

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
which indicates that the shell detonated

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.720 
which indicates that the shell detonated
from<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.350> impact<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:36.070> probably<00:02:37.070> not<00:02:37.280> much<00:02:37.460> of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
from the impact so probably not much of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.870 
from the impact so probably not much of
it<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:38.120> left<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:39.050> if<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.220> left<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.730> will<00:02:40.820> be

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
it is left or if it is left it will be

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.300 
it is left or if it is left it will be
probably<00:02:41.150> flattened<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.910> don't<00:02:43.910> know

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
probably flattened out so I don't know

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.050 
probably flattened out so I don't know
kind<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.430> little<00:02:46.670> bit<00:02:46.820> let<00:02:47.150> down<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:48.040> guess

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
kind of a little bit let down I guess

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.030 
kind of a little bit let down I guess
but<00:02:50.060> another<00:02:50.750> interesting<00:02:51.440> part<00:02:51.680> about<00:02:51.770> this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
but another interesting part about this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.670 
but another interesting part about this
is<00:02:52.100> it's<00:02:52.820> been<00:02:53.030> over<00:02:53.330> stamped<00:02:53.840> twice<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:56.680> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
is it's been over stamped twice so you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.020 
is it's been over stamped twice so you
basically<00:02:57.860> have<00:02:58.190> two<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.430> everything<00:02:58.550> over

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
basically have two of everything over

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.360 
basically have two of everything over
lapping<00:02:59.210> so<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.990> have<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.290> model<00:03:00.830> number<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
lapping so you have the model number and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.140 
lapping so you have the model number and
in<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> patenting<00:03:02.120> date<00:03:03.130> /<00:03:04.130> stamp<00:03:04.400> whereas

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
in the patenting date / stamp whereas

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.310 
in the patenting date / stamp whereas
this<00:03:05.330> one<00:03:05.390> actually<00:03:05.780> only<00:03:06.200> has<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:06.740> so<00:03:08.320> you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
this one actually only has one so you

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.080 
this one actually only has one so you
can<00:03:09.500> actually<00:03:09.620> see<00:03:09.800> this<00:03:10.010> one<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.370> fine<00:03:10.580> Mick

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
can actually see this one the fine Mick

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.080 
can actually see this one the fine Mick
of<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> pin<00:03:11.570> short<00:03:11.900> there<00:03:12.550> while<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:13.760> one<00:03:13.970> is

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
of the pin short there while this one is

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.330 
of the pin short there while this one is
exposed<00:03:14.720> out<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:16.220> yeah<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:18.500> too<00:03:18.920> brash

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
exposed out so yeah here too brash

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.310 
exposed out so yeah here too brash
shells<00:03:19.700> I<00:03:19.880> found<00:03:19.910> today<00:03:20.480> these<00:03:20.960> are<00:03:21.290> both<00:03:22.150> 30

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
shells I found today these are both 30

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.770 
shells I found today these are both 30
Remington<00:03:24.340> his<00:03:25.340> Remington<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:27.230> know<00:03:27.350> UMC

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
Remington his Remington you know UMC

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.890 
Remington his Remington you know UMC
very<00:03:29.780> similar<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.320> other<00:03:30.620> one<00:03:31.070> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
very similar to the other one the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900 
very similar to the other one the
actually<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.110> right<00:03:33.200> here<00:03:33.790> except<00:03:34.790> this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
actually have it right here except this

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.030 
actually have it right here except this
one's<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.210> 35<00:03:35.660> Remington<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.790> much<00:03:37.790> smaller<00:03:38.120> but

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
one's a 35 Remington so much smaller but

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.320 
one's a 35 Remington so much smaller but
probably<00:03:40.040> from<00:03:40.310> same<00:03:40.960> time<00:03:41.960> period<00:03:43.090> not<00:03:44.090> quite

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
probably from same time period not quite

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.200 
probably from same time period not quite
sure<00:03:44.360> when<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.810> was<00:03:44.900> fired<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.670> yeah<00:03:46.670> probably

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
sure when it was fired but yeah probably

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.170 
sure when it was fired but yeah probably
close<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.770> that<00:03:49.190> looks<00:03:50.120> cool<00:03:50.300> and<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.980> one<00:03:52.190> is

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
close so that looks cool and this one is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.500 
close so that looks cool and this one is
a<00:03:53.660> bullet<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.980> found<00:03:55.340> this<00:03:55.580> actually<00:03:56.450> my

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
a bullet and I found this actually my

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.410 
a bullet and I found this actually my
friend<00:03:56.690> found<00:03:56.960> it<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:58.370> took<00:03:58.790> my<00:03:59.030> friend<00:03:59.210> at<00:03:59.330> him

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
friend found it I took my friend at him

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.100 
friend found it I took my friend at him
metal<00:03:59.900> detecting<00:04:00.200> with<00:04:00.350> me<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:00.890> um<00:04:01.810> he<00:04:02.810> found

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
metal detecting with me but um he found

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.070 
metal detecting with me but um he found
it<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.530> hole<00:04:04.460> with<00:04:04.790> bunch<00:04:05.570> lots<00:04:05.900> of

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
it in the hole with bunch lots of

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.440 
it in the hole with bunch lots of
shrapnel<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:07.190> we<00:04:07.790> thought<00:04:07.940> was<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.150> shrapnel

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
shrapnel so we thought was a shrapnel

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.150 
shrapnel so we thought was a shrapnel
and<00:04:08.750> then<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.020> know<00:04:09.110> he<00:04:09.230> pulled<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.010> out<00:04:10.130> i

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
and then you know he pulled it out i

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.000 
and then you know he pulled it out i
looked<00:04:10.430> at<00:04:10.550> it's<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:10.880> hey<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.360> bullet<00:04:11.680> but<00:04:12.680> I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
looked at it's like hey to bullet but I

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.910 
looked at it's like hey to bullet but I
measured<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.510> know<00:04:14.570> what<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.080> 35

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
measured it and you know what is a 35

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.520 
measured it and you know what is a 35
caliber<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.940> probably<00:04:17.150> belong<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.230> one

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
caliber so I probably belong to the one

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.390 
caliber so I probably belong to the one
of<00:04:18.620> these<00:04:18.739> shelves<00:04:19.510> so<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.780> was<00:04:20.930> about<00:04:21.109> maybe

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
of these shelves so this was about maybe

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.800 
of these shelves so this was about maybe
150<00:04:23.400> yards<00:04:23.669> away<00:04:23.789> from<00:04:23.909> the<00:04:24.770> these<00:04:25.770> shells<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
150 yards away from the these shells so

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.170 
150 yards away from the these shells so
I<00:04:28.229> don't<00:04:29.039> know<00:04:29.099> maybe<00:04:29.280> I'll<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.759> belongs<00:04:30.060> to

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I don't know maybe I'll it belongs to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.010 
I don't know maybe I'll it belongs to
those<00:04:30.949> here's<00:04:31.949> a<00:04:32.270> shotgun<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:33.629> base<00:04:33.840> of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.619 
and all of these were inside of it but
fell<00:04:57.900> out<00:04:58.110> or<00:04:58.319> actually<00:04:58.919> pulled<00:04:59.099> it<00:04:59.189> out<00:04:59.370> but

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
fell out or actually pulled it out but

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.719 
fell out or actually pulled it out but
saying<00:05:00.629> it<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.020> anyways<00:05:01.379> this<00:05:02.219> is<00:05:02.279> actually

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
saying it but anyways this is actually

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.159 
saying it but anyways this is actually
different<00:05:02.879> views<00:05:03.240> from<00:05:03.419> what<00:05:03.629> I<00:05:03.659> had<00:05:03.930> before

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
different views from what I had before

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.339 
different views from what I had before
duh<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:05.490> I'm<00:05:06.000> still<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.960> know<00:05:06.990> we're<00:05:07.169> trying

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
duh and I'm still you know we're trying

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.129 
duh and I'm still you know we're trying
to<00:05:07.409> figure<00:05:07.529> out<00:05:07.680> what<00:05:07.860> type<00:05:08.129> of<00:05:08.159> use<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:08.909> is

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
to figure out what type of use it is

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.290 
to figure out what type of use it is
probably<00:05:10.139> intact<00:05:10.529> but<00:05:10.819> well<00:05:11.819> it<00:05:11.969> doesn't<00:05:12.210> have

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
probably intact but well it doesn't have

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.800 
probably intact but well it doesn't have
any<00:05:12.449> markings<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:14.150> it's<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.210> mystery<00:05:15.539> fuse

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
any markings so it's a mystery fuse

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.969 
any markings so it's a mystery fuse
here's<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.870> little<00:05:19.139> pocket<00:05:19.319> knife<00:05:19.620> i<00:05:19.710> found

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
here's a little pocket knife i found

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.649 
here's a little pocket knife i found
this<00:05:20.849> play<00:05:21.120> was<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.919> know<00:05:23.039> still<00:05:23.849> this<00:05:24.419> blade

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
this play was you know still this blade

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.459 
this play was you know still this blade
was<00:05:24.810> folded<00:05:25.169> in<00:05:25.289> by<00:05:25.469> applied<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.639> out<00:05:27.289> and<00:05:28.289> you

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
was folded in by applied it out and you

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.260 
was folded in by applied it out and you
know<00:05:28.620> what<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:29.009> center<00:05:29.400> part<00:05:29.639> of<00:05:29.819> this<00:05:29.909> still

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
know what the center part of this still

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.749 
know what the center part of this still
is<00:05:30.360> pretty<00:05:30.599> sharp<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:31.080> pretty<00:05:32.039> much<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.460> so

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
is pretty sharp so pretty much that so

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:39.559 
is pretty sharp so pretty much that so
bleh<00:05:33.150> these<00:05:33.479> blades<00:05:34.259> are<00:05:37.129> mine<00:05:38.129> is<00:05:38.219> it<00:05:38.569> steel

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
bleh these blades are mine is it steel

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.300 
bleh these blades are mine is it steel
probably<00:05:40.289> in<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.789> bodies<00:05:41.789> brass<00:05:43.009> so<00:05:44.009> that's

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
probably in the bodies brass so that's

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.070 
probably in the bodies brass so that's
some<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.669> basic<00:05:45.000> fines<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:47.839> here's<00:05:48.839> what

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
some of the basic fines and here's what

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.050 
some of the basic fines and here's what
i've<00:05:49.229> been<00:05:49.379> making<00:05:49.589> so<00:05:50.099> far<00:05:50.370> you've<00:05:50.729> already

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
i've been making so far you've already

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.179 
i've been making so far you've already
seen<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.240> bolt<00:05:51.539> before<00:05:52.669> half<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.789> bold<00:05:54.500> and<00:05:55.500> I've

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189 
seen a bolt before half a bold and I've

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.610 
seen a bolt before half a bold and I've
been<00:05:56.310> working<00:05:56.639> on<00:05:56.699> the<00:05:57.409> feeding<00:05:58.409> mechanism

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
been working on the feeding mechanism

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.579 
been working on the feeding mechanism
for<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.250> mg42<00:06:01.400> so<00:06:02.400> yeah<00:06:02.669> I'll<00:06:02.969> explain<00:06:03.930> detail

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
for the mg42 so yeah I'll explain detail

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:10.129 
for the mg42 so yeah I'll explain detail
how<00:06:05.039> it<00:06:05.219> works<00:06:05.460> later<00:06:06.270> on<00:06:06.830> but<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:08.990> that's<00:06:09.990> what

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
how it works later on but so that's what

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.619 
how it works later on but so that's what
I<00:06:10.169> can<00:06:10.319> work<00:06:10.469> on<00:06:10.879> so<00:06:11.879> least<00:06:12.060> you<00:06:12.180> know<00:06:12.360> that

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629 
I can work on so least you know that

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.510 
I can work on so least you know that
I've<00:06:13.020> been<00:06:13.050> making<00:06:13.560> something<00:06:15.199> yeah<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:17.099> I'll

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
I've been making something yeah and I'll

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.050 
I've been making something yeah and I'll
go<00:06:17.699> to<00:06:17.909> the<00:06:18.060> making<00:06:18.389> these<00:06:19.069> are<00:06:20.069> my<00:06:20.339> belt<00:06:20.729> which

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
go to the making these are my belt which

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
go to the making these are my belt which
are<00:06:21.389> pain<00:06:21.900> in<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.199> butt<00:06:22.699> and<00:06:23.699> you<00:06:24.479> know<00:06:24.599> what<00:06:24.779> I

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
are pain in the butt and you know what I

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.980 
are pain in the butt and you know what I
think<00:06:25.529> I<00:06:25.650> might<00:06:25.889> just<00:06:26.069> even<00:06:26.610> going<00:06:27.089> by<00:06:27.300> a<00:06:27.330> seven

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
think I might just even going by a seven

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.010 
think I might just even going by a seven
dollar<00:06:28.110> Yugoslavian<00:06:29.099> copy<00:06:29.400> off<00:06:30.360> of<00:06:30.419> the

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
dollar Yugoslavian copy off of the

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.890 
dollar Yugoslavian copy off of the
Internet

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
Internet

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.740 
Internet
but<00:06:32.440> and<00:06:33.009> i'll<00:06:33.220> probably<00:06:33.850> just<00:06:33.970> make<00:06:34.180> like<00:06:34.419> 10

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
but and i'll probably just make like 10

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.150 
but and i'll probably just make like 10
and<00:06:35.520> stop<00:06:36.520> with<00:06:36.790> the<00:06:37.000> starter<00:06:37.540> tab<00:06:38.160> so

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
and stop with the starter tab so

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.800 
and stop with the starter tab so
basically<00:06:39.669> you<00:06:40.030> cut<00:06:40.330> out<00:06:40.449> these<00:06:40.630> little

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
basically you cut out these little

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.450 
basically you cut out these little
templates<00:06:41.380> out<00:06:42.370> of<00:06:42.669> fruit<00:06:42.880> cans<00:06:44.280> drill<00:06:45.280> holes

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
templates out of fruit cans drill holes

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.520 
templates out of fruit cans drill holes
in<00:06:45.610> it<00:06:45.729> and<00:06:46.150> then<00:06:46.360> you<00:06:46.780> know<00:06:46.900> connect<00:06:47.410> them

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
in it and then you know connect them

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.210 
in it and then you know connect them
with<00:06:47.560> a<00:06:48.930> little<00:06:49.930> spring<00:06:50.320> or<00:06:50.530> coil<00:06:50.830> man<00:06:51.070> out<00:06:51.190> of

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
with a little spring or coil man out of

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.680 
with a little spring or coil man out of
this<00:06:51.430> wire<00:06:52.860> but<00:06:53.860> yeah<00:06:54.340> so<00:06:54.820> that's<00:06:55.210> pretty<00:06:55.570> much

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
this wire but yeah so that's pretty much

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.279 
this wire but yeah so that's pretty much
it<00:06:56.050> on<00:06:56.380> what<00:06:56.590> I've<00:06:56.740> been<00:06:56.889> doing<00:06:57.070> and<00:06:57.520> hopefully

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
it on what I've been doing and hopefully

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.400 
it on what I've been doing and hopefully
when<00:06:59.289> everything<00:06:59.979> is<00:07:00.190> dried<00:07:00.520> up<00:07:01.080> outside<00:07:02.080> I'll

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
when everything is dried up outside I'll

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.850 
when everything is dried up outside I'll
probably<00:07:02.949> take<00:07:03.280> you<00:07:03.520> guys<00:07:03.669> along<00:07:04.350> all<00:07:05.350> metal

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
probably take you guys along all metal

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.500 
probably take you guys along all metal
detecting<00:07:06.449> so<00:07:07.449> see<00:07:08.199> you<00:07:08.320> then
