00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 hi how about friends of virtus i am sergio 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.290
 Moreno and in this new video tutorial 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.980
 We will learn to download and install the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.039
 crash team racing game 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.679
 for your feet for good the game is 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:19.760
 in ebook format obviously because it 's from 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:23.750
 this genre for fiesp and I weigh 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.000
 like 290 megabytes is not much and it's 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.720
 divided into two parts 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 I repeat is in English and two parts of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.280
 290 megs and uploaded to facebook mega 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.640
 along with all the other games 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.829
 dedicated to this oversight I do not stop 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.730
 you this is the last video 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.769
 so good at lix for others 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.329
 floors the after command and with one the two the 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.329
 three the most and good 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.329
 let us begin 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.500
 because the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.600
 go to the link of the description of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 video 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.170
 well I have it copied and I paste it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.380
 simply produces the one click 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.360
 well let's hope you load the page 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.159
 obviously you will see two links , but already 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.100
 I will show how to download it with a single 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.030
 day 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.150
 why 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.190
 good is the same for the two good one 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.020
 downloaded we have to be 5 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 seconds 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.850
 to have this button of those high 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 advertising that we created this button will 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 we click 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.040
 and it's good to start loading what is the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.020
 mega page 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.830
 if they stay stuck in this part 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.710
 just update the part 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.580
 the problem of the non -file page 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.240
 good we will see casting racing 11 I want 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 part of one 150 megabytes 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.910
 good they give you download and automatically 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.040
 to start what is the download 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.780
 fortunately now I have good here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 I have the other link but I do not show them 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.540
 for reasons of time and it's the same 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.129
 for the links 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.969
 well once we have downloaded 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.969
 both parts 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.090
 we walk next to my house I have 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.430
 this folder and we will have casting racing 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.549
 and in low sergio point part 1 and dice 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.310
 in the corners 3 megabytes and 270 and 103 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.489
 megas readers but it will be downloaded separately 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.250
 between 5 and 10 minutes is not much is very 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 fast and good what yes next 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.189
 is with the google run installed 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.270
 obviously we are going to select the two 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.670
 parts 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.980
 of the game and we will give right click 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 to any of these two and we're going to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 give you this file you can bring here 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.810
 I am a foreigner to know the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.530
 writers 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.530
 on the desk 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.530
 start what the extraction in this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.099
 box I will say that says extracting from 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.780
 carrandi with forgiveness casting racing good 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.720
 we have to be here I said until the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.010
 up to 100% is something very fast and they go to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.569
 extremes 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.569
 as energy almost ends 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.170
 and once it's finished extracting us 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.050
 we go where we are extracted in my 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.270
 case of desk selection 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.360
 and we'll have this folder that calls 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:49.090
 that the racing and we saw it we will see the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.069
 boot a total of 290 black 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.370
 now the most important thing is the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.230
 installation where is this folder this 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.520
 We have to copy it to the folder 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.310
 game and sting folder 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.650
 the easy greeting is great science but if 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.900
 they know they do not understand it as 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.550
 could help by facebook or by mixed 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.470
 that I leave the address of the video 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.870
 so that if they are going to help 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.760
 and well that would be all but as 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.070
 clarification I inform you that if you have a 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.050
 pack 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.670
 let's say the m 33 that is called something like that 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.360
 is going to work or will it work 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.360
 very bad 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.499
 I would need to have the Fox Loader 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.319
 what is a plugin but good has 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.280
 differences different versions and the 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.280
 cons work 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 What I recommend doing is to have him 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.490
 I tried 10 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.580
 with version 6.60 I leave a video 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.100
 on how to do it in the description of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.930
 video so good as always 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.050
 for more like and favorite videos thanks 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.620
 for coming videos I leave the links in the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.360

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.360
 7 - thank you and see you next time
