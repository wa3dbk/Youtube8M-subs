00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
alright so here we have the substrate

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.639 
alright so here we have the substrate
it's<00:00:35.309> aspen<00:00:36.120> mulch<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's aspen mulch it's pretty much the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.190 
it's aspen mulch it's pretty much the
best<00:00:38.610> substrate<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.050> also

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
best substrate you can get you can also

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.420 
best substrate you can get you can also
use<00:00:40.500> bark<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.550> stuff<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.329> but<00:00:43.250> this<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
use bark and stuff like that but this is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.270 
use bark and stuff like that but this is
definitely<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.059> best<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.820> yeah<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.690> heating

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
definitely the best and yeah for heating

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
definitely the best and yeah for heating
you<00:00:50.280> need<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.640> ground<00:00:51.149> heat<00:00:51.420> instead<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.989> like

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you need on ground heat instead of like

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.470 
you need on ground heat instead of like
air<00:00:52.469> temperature<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> heat<00:00:54.270> pad

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
air temperature see you have a heat pad

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.930 
air temperature see you have a heat pad
on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.840> warm<00:00:55.410> side<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.160> should<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.489> around<00:00:56.610> 80

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
on the warm side it should be around 80

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.630 
on the warm side it should be around 80
85<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.440> ground<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> heat<00:00:59.460> patch

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
85 on the ground here and the heat patch

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.290 
85 on the ground here and the heat patch
keep<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> around<00:01:00.239> there<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.890> um<00:01:01.890> need<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> hide

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
on both sides need high on the cool side

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.830 
on both sides need high on the cool side
of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> warm<00:01:05.909> side<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.080> put<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> here
