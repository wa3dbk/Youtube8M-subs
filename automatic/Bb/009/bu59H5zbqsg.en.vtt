lot of TV shows and movies being edited
on<00:02:33.410> Mac<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.760> me<00:02:34.910> our<00:02:35.090> school<00:02:35.450> was<00:02:35.690> all<00:02:35.840> mac

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
on Mac and for me our school was all mac

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.980 
on Mac and for me our school was all mac
based<00:02:36.500> computer<00:02:37.100> systems

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.940 

when<00:02:44.990> I<00:02:45.080> was<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.200> kid<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.410> used<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.620> think<00:02:45.710> I'd<00:02:45.860> be

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
when I was a kid I used to think I'd be

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.340 
when I was a kid I used to think I'd be
flying<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.670> know<00:02:47.510> flying<00:02:47.810> cars<00:02:48.110> through

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
flying you know flying cars through

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.560 
flying you know flying cars through
space<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.010> by<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.700> time<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.940> was<00:02:50.120> an<00:02:50.210> adult<00:02:50.300> but

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
space and by the time I was an adult but

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.070 
space and by the time I was an adult but
that<00:02:50.750> didn't<00:02:51.020> happen<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:52.780> think<00:02:53.780> even<00:02:53.960> though

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
that didn't happen I think even though

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.510 
that didn't happen I think even though
technologies<00:02:54.620> progress<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> lot<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:55.460> much

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
technologies progress a lot so much

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.990 
technologies progress a lot so much
recently<00:02:57.070> technology<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.310> holographic

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
recently technology for holographic

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.820 
recently technology for holographic
stuff<00:02:59.210> i<00:02:59.450> don't<00:02:59.630> i'm<00:02:59.840> not<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.080> super<00:03:00.440> tech<00:03:00.650> geek

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
stuff i don't i'm not a super tech geek

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.930 
stuff i don't i'm not a super tech geek
but<00:03:01.040> i<00:03:01.070> think<00:03:01.340> it's<00:03:01.490> probably<00:03:01.730> hard<00:03:01.910> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
but i think it's probably hard to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.670 
but i think it's probably hard to
develop<00:03:02.150> especially<00:03:02.750> stuff<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.380> touching

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
develop especially stuff that's touching

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.730 
develop especially stuff that's touching
in<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.010> air<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:05.140> think<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:06.230> really<00:03:06.470> hard<00:03:06.650> to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
in the air I think it's really hard to

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.620 
in the air I think it's really hard to
beat<00:03:06.890> those<00:03:07.070> first<00:03:07.400> moments<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:08.000> people

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
beat those first moments of people

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.090 
beat those first moments of people
seeing<00:03:08.840> an<00:03:08.960> iphone<00:03:09.230> one<00:03:09.470> come<00:03:09.710> out<00:03:09.860> and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
seeing an iphone one come out and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.070 
seeing an iphone one come out and
they're<00:03:10.370> really<00:03:10.640> amazed<00:03:11.120> by<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:12.050> i

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
they're really amazed by that but i

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720 
they're really amazed by that but i
think<00:03:12.140> apple<00:03:12.590> will<00:03:12.620> continue<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.220> surprise<00:03:13.370> us

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
think apple will continue to surprise us

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
think apple will continue to surprise us
and<00:03:13.790> give<00:03:14.120> us<00:03:14.150> some<00:03:14.270> really<00:03:14.720> cool<00:03:14.980> technology

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
and give us some really cool technology

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500 
and give us some really cool technology
you<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.400> if<00:03:16.490> the<00:03:16.610> holographic<00:03:17.030> thing<00:03:17.300> came

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
you know if the holographic thing came

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.870 
you know if the holographic thing came
to<00:03:18.110> be<00:03:18.230> real<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.710> would<00:03:18.800> be<00:03:18.980> another<00:03:19.550> aha

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
to be real that would be another aha

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.510 
to be real that would be another aha
moment

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:45.750 

thanks<00:03:25.240> so<00:03:25.330> much<00:03:25.390> for<00:03:25.630> having<00:03:25.720> me

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.819
