statue it's by Mark Andrea Dornan and I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.530 
statue it's by Mark Andrea Dornan and I
believe<00:00:11.550> they<00:00:11.670> combined<00:00:12.000> their<00:00:12.120> names<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
believe they combined their names to

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.039 
believe they combined their names to
call<00:00:12.719> it

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
call it

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.379 
call it
McCrea<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.549> they've<00:00:14.700> done<00:00:14.820> other<00:00:15.059> things

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
McCrea I think they've done other things

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.960 
McCrea I think they've done other things
too<00:00:15.630> rather<00:00:16.260> than<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.830> Roger<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> Jessica

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
too rather than just Roger and Jessica

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.700 
too rather than just Roger and Jessica
but<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.150> haven't<00:00:18.359> heard<00:00:18.690> much<00:00:18.930> about<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.500> since

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.130 
can see here is Jessica her face is a
little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.239> think<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.110> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little bit off I think it's because of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
little bit off I think it's because of
that<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:38.190> under<00:00:38.430> her<00:00:38.520> nose<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.600> can

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that right under her nose there you can

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
that right under her nose there you can
see<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.290> cleft<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
see there's a little cleft it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.479 
see there's a little cleft it
something's<00:00:42.530> little<00:00:43.530> off<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.129> her<00:00:44.219> hair

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
something's little off and then her hair

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
something's little off and then her hair
color<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.239> correct<00:00:45.989> either<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.620> more

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
color is not correct either it's more

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
color is not correct either it's more
Brown<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> should<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:49.500> vibrant

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Brown here it should be a more vibrant

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
Brown here it should be a more vibrant
orange<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.149> she<00:00:51.300> still<00:00:51.510> looks<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:51.780> good

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
orange but she still looks really good

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
orange but she still looks really good
you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.309> eyeshadow<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you can see the the eyeshadow of the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.680 
you can see the the eyeshadow of the
gold<00:00:54.300> earring<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.829> body<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.399> great<00:00:56.760> though<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
gold earring the body is great though it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.819 
gold earring the body is great though it
is<00:00:57.899> definitely<00:00:58.649> Jessica's<00:00:59.190> body<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.829> dress

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is definitely Jessica's body the dress

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
is definitely Jessica's body the dress
is<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.699> correct<00:01:03.030> color<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.110> more

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
is I think the correct color it's more

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.740 
is I think the correct color it's more
of<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> pink<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> should<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:06.330> it's<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of a pink as it should be when it's in

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
of a pink as it should be when it's in
the<00:01:06.960> ink<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> paint<00:01:07.530> Club<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.159> glitter

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the ink and paint Club you know glitter

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
the ink and paint Club you know glitter
usually<00:01:09.450> people<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.930> dark<00:01:10.200> red<00:01:10.439> or

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
usually people just have dark red or

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
usually people just have dark red or
maroon<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:13.020> it's

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
maroon and that's not really it's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.030 
maroon and that's not really it's
correct<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> definitely<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.540> say

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
correct this is definitely I would say

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.789 
correct this is definitely I would say
more<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.549> she<00:01:17.759> looks<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:20.299> she<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.799> balanced

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
more what she looks like she is balanced

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.130 
more what she looks like she is balanced
on<00:01:23.040> those<00:01:23.400> two<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:23.700> feet<00:01:24.150> somehow<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.049> don't

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
on those two little feet somehow I don't

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.740 
on those two little feet somehow I don't
even<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
even know I don't want to know but as

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.710 
even know I don't want to know but as
you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.619> leg<00:01:28.950> comes<00:01:29.400> right<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you can see a leg comes right out and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.280 
you can see a leg comes right out and
they<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:32.040> got<00:01:32.250> her<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> stand<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:33.290> just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
they really got her to stand up just

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.679 
they really got her to stand up just
like<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:36.450> her

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
like that so you can see there on her

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.870 
like that so you can see there on her
shoes<00:01:37.100> very<00:01:38.100> long<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
shoes very long way and all of that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.190 
shoes very long way and all of that
glitter<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.130> definitely

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
glitter so I think this is definitely

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.789 
glitter so I think this is definitely
the<00:01:46.200> closest<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.810> really<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
