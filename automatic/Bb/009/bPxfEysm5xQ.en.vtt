00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.980
 Hello 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:13.690

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.710
 see if we get what they have to see 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:21.160
 example the succulent Spanish paella with 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.579
 the exotic asian beauty the 25 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.579
 seconds 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.950
 sure yes sure you have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 guessed the light rice the rice the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.800
 rice that remains on the face apart from the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.140
 succulent paella that we already know that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.239
 rice that gives Asian women in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.809
 japan in china that appearance of 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 porcelain the faces true yes 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.830
 beautiful you remember where you remember 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.900
 our grandmothers who put on powders 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.460
 of rice in the face always to go out to 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.260
 the street did not leave if its capita 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.150
 rice powder that also gave them a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.560
 very beautiful porcelain appearance is 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.899
 it turns out that the rice and some 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.930
 wonderful cosmetic properties is 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.070
 anti-inflammatory regenerate protects you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 of the sun in addition to bleach than that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.280
 let's talk about making whiteners 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.740
 for the skin I already know that we have done 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.210
 some here at our shows and we've 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.869
 said whiteners but whiteners 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 with lemon citrus base and maybe 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.240
 for some skins are too 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.009
 powerful 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 so today we are going to use our 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.420
 friend the rice the rice in grain and the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.380
 rice powder to make two types 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 different 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 of bleach one that has been bleached 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.430
 the one with water base that is rice water 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.649
 and another bleach already textured 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 mask , and will be based milk 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.039
 agreement then let's start and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 we started with the rice water that the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.220
 we have here and we have here the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 ingredients that we need 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.260
 two tablespoons of rice 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.040
 two cups of water and also 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.180
 we'll need a little scoop and a strainer that 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 that's it 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.450
 let's proceed to do our 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.400
 miraculous or almost miraculous rice water 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.790
 in the simplest way you could 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.550
 imagine is throwing the rice inside the 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.880
 Water 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.940
 and now we're going with the little hands 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.840
 always very clean handymen we are going to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.800
 start stirring to stir during a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.420
 minute or two 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.030
 until the water became cloudy 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.520
 completely 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.040
 well you see here we have the water already 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.319
 blanquita 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.840
 the nutrients have gone into the water and 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.489
 now we are going to use it and to be able to 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.530
 use the first thing we have to 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.150
 to do is to strain the one important thing 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.219
 what I wanted to tell you is that the rice that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.530
 let's use it is interesting that it's 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.230
 brand and of the best possible quality and it is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.560
 the possible already to curl the curl 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:56.270
 organic agree now let's 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.780
 spend this water straining though a 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.780
 full 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.010
 and now we dry the little table a bit 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.450
 so that everything is perfect and with the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.060
 very clean handyman we will use 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
 as that way so refreshing that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 we do it in summer when we have 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.900
 so heat to the water the face to the face the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.340
 gala sprays not the same simply 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.750
 we will take is the bleach that tonic 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.500
 of rice in the face around the neck 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.760
 neckline 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.380
 then we leave it for a couple of 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.780
 minutes and with a towel we took it out a 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.150
 little or the best that I would recommend 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.450
 let it air dry in a way 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.660
 completely natural according 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.730
 Well now let's move 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.099
 The bleach 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.900
 with mask base and here we have 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.450
 the elements that we need 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:57.090
 Ingredients 2 tablespoons of powder 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.090
 rice and a little bit of whole milk 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.100
 let's make the average 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.310
 of our mask we are going to take 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.840
 milk in the rice powder so that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.000
 mix by mixing until 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.380
 have the desired consistency of what is 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.480
 the consistency we want to achieve 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.040
 well, the consistency of the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.590
 mask simply that when the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.239
 let's put on the face does not slip away and 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.270
 it stays well attached to us and is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:26.190
 agreement then we have to go trying we are going to 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.190
 put a little to stir 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.480
 another little bit another little bit more 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.480
 two teaspoons 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.340
 you have to be patient because what 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.930
 important is that everything is mixed 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.090
 and adding a little bit as you 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.090
 let's go needing a little bit more 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.389
 well here we have our mix our 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.580
 mask you see the consistency that 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.050
 It has pastures and is for us 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.229
 get stuck when we put it in the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.610
 no face and no running off to stay 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.770
 on your site 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.810
 then we apply the mask for 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.210
 the whole face will turn 10 or the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.699
 neck down the neckline let it dry 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.800
 for about 20 minutes and then what 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.840
 We can remove with warm water the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.490
 wipe dry us well and continue with 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.099
 our usual beauty regime is 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.050
 morning or evening is the 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.800
 frequency of use, whether it is 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.840
 mask as if it's rice water one 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.919
 to three times a week for a month and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.169
 it can also be something else that is 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.120
 combine it so it is to put us by 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.880
 example once a week the mask 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.820
 and twice a week the rice water 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.870
 and if you have a bit left over then you can 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.400
 keep in the fridge that nothing happens 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.100
 both the mask and the water 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.810
 they keep very well and if you see that you want 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.480
 prolong the treatment because you have not 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.010
 reached the point of clearance that 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.800
 you wanted or plan what action because 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.510
 you know what you apply another month or a week 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.490
 more until you get it there's no 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.410
 problem is completely innocuous and very 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.450
 healthy for the skin I hope that you 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.790
 work and you 'll tell me later 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:23.229
 that you are well white and very good 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:23.229
