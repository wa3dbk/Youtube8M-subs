00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the gold leaf to be applied to I'll be

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.899 
the gold leaf to be applied to I'll be
applying<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.129> size<00:01:05.450> with<00:01:06.650> my<00:01:07.650> angle<00:01:08.189> number<00:01:08.520> 8

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
applying the size with my angle number 8

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.630 
applying the size with my angle number 8
brush<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> final<00:01:10.830> little<00:01:10.920> parts<00:01:11.490> on

so gently take your gold leaf out and
you<00:01:44.950> get<00:01:45.100> 25<00:01:45.820> sheets<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.870> each<00:01:47.260> is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
you get 25 sheets and each is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
you get 25 sheets and each is
interleaved

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
interleaved

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.899 
interleaved
with<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.630> piece<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.350> tissue<00:01:50.740> paper<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.490> that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
with a piece of tissue paper and that

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
with a piece of tissue paper and that
makes<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.330> application<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.170> lot<00:01:53.470> more<00:01:53.740> simple

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
makes the application a lot more simple

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.630 
makes the application a lot more simple
so<00:01:56.710> apply<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.400> sheets<00:01:57.850> as<00:01:58.060> gently<00:01:58.690> as<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.140> can

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
so apply the sheets as gently as you can

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.910 
so apply the sheets as gently as you can
rolling<00:02:00.640> them<00:02:00.790> across<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.300> canvas<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.960> like<00:02:02.740> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
rolling them across the canvas I like to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.130 
rolling them across the canvas I like to
tile<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.550> overlap<00:02:04.240> them<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:07.300> now<00:02:07.690> I'm<00:02:07.869> just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
tile and overlap them so now I'm just

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.540 
tile and overlap them so now I'm just
gently<00:02:08.619> rubbing<00:02:09.039> off<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.119> gold<00:02:10.390> leaf<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.550> you

gently rubbing off the gold leaf and you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.780 
gently rubbing off the gold leaf and you
will<00:02:12.700> see<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.870> areas<00:02:14.530> where<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.190> haven't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
will see that the areas where I haven't

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.320 
will see that the areas where I haven't
applied<00:02:16.060> my<00:02:16.840> size<00:02:17.520> simply<00:02:18.520> doesn't<00:02:18.730> speak<00:02:19.120> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
applied my size simply doesn't speak to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.449
