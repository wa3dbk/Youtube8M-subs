00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.020
 from youtube I am an agent we are in 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.090
 a new channel in this case we're going to 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.860
 make a top 5 of games for the 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 psp emulator on android and good 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.850
 let's start 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.800
 number 5 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.030
 in position number 5 we have adapted and 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.039
 story 3 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.410
 this adventure game 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.570
 fun frustrating sometimes for not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.150
 be able to do some missions 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 but more than anything fun because 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 being a toy costs a bit to spend 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.520
 some rooms and good nothing for 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.510
 that's how I play as pretty good 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.629
 we will have to look for batteries 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 you look to get some things to do 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.210
 some tricks 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 and good nothing here as you need showing 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 in the video we will look for batteries and not 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 they will look for more things they will be able to play with you 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.079
 with woody with soldiers and good 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.079
 among others 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.880
 number 4 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.130
 in position number 4 we have a vice gta 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.759
 city ​​stories 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.070
 a sandbox game or open world 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.130
 you can follow the missions 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 you can play freely good if you do not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.329
 I would say a lot about this game because it is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.820
 well known good the saga of gta 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.380
 quite known for that is fine 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.590
 I 'm going to leave you a little bit of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590
 video 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 number 3 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.130
 at number 3 we have the double 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.850
 double with stars a pretty game 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:00.049
 entertained with pretty graphics 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.299
 good a super good gameplay where 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.930
 we have the best characters that 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.130
 there were and what's in the table w we have 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.280
 as a canteen of the rock 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.450
 rey mysterio triple h the big show and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.099
 good several more characters 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.349
 I do not have much that if the games because 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.740
 it's clear fighting and then it has shown a 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.130
 little how would the fight in the game be like 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.250
 good as you see there starts some graphics 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.630
 very good and now let's go to the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.960
 fight like this 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.200
 that is the entrance as good now yes 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.989
 let's go to the fight 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.090
 and well this is what is the fight 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.830
 quite realistic enough or 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.019
 compared to reality, it's not like 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.930
 make it the best in the world but without 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.010
 However for psp what was done for 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.470
 now why do not I put on April 2 w 2 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.330
 14 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.760
 first because it is the slow 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.190
 good for some slow but compared 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.830
 with sound and all this has many 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.790
 better graphics and with the best 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.790
 stars where we can have 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 several championship two fights the team 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 of one 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 up here the number 3 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.459
 number 2 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.890
 at number 2 we have fifa 14 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.180
 waiting for game 15 you do not know 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.340
 If salt side but because there 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.230
 speculations that they say that they do not 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.610
 they will be more for p esp or for others 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.010
 consoles this is the poster figure 14 what 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.290
 I put in number two because some 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.420
 others go after them will 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.270
 regular also so bad 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.120
 well it's pretty good the game has 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.580
 various game modes 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.430
 for you to be declared 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.670
 and I would show you how it is a match 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.670
 now 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.209
 and well we are already in the party 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.300
 and this is what followed more or less the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.390
 free shot for now now let's see 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.310
 good is that it looks better I'll pass it on 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.450
 video is looking a bit bad but 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.450
 no eye looks better 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.700
 look good 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.459
 the gameplay is pretty good going 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.459
 Quick 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.140
 it's still pretty fast 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.510
 in this video up to the mode I think it's 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.520
 easy I think it is but they can 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 change the difficulty mode if you 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.650
 they want and well up here the number 2 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.830

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.040
 video is the number one we're going to see it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.040

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.060
 2015 video in the mirror put it in this 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:01.060
