00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
which in all honesty I didn't really

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730 
which in all honesty I didn't really
think<00:01:34.490> was<00:01:34.909> worth<00:01:35.120> it<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.540> me<00:01:35.690> idea<00:01:36.170> but<00:01:36.440> I

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
think nevertheless these would look

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.910

really<00:01:39.320> nice

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
really nice

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
I've gone for the long ones rather than

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.750 
I've gone for the long ones rather than
the<00:01:41.870> two-finger<00:01:42.320> ones<00:01:42.620> as<00:01:43.159> you've<00:01:43.430> still<00:01:43.640> got

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
the two-finger ones as you've still got

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.539 
the two-finger ones as you've still got
the<00:01:43.880> option<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.299> using<00:01:44.450> two<00:01:44.630> two<00:01:44.810> fingers<00:01:45.549> it's

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
the option of using two two fingers it's

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.609 
the option of using two two fingers it's
going<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.760> show<00:01:46.909> up<00:01:47.170> just<00:01:48.170> personal

going to show up just personal

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.340 
going to show up just personal
preference<00:01:48.830> really<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.310> think<00:01:49.460> isn't<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:50.350> so

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
preference really I think isn't it so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.539 
preference really I think isn't it so
that's<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.770> clutch<00:01:52.700> and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549

that's the clutch and
well<00:01:56.450> sod<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.939> you've<00:01:59.060> got<00:01:59.240> your<00:01:59.390> options

before I put them on the bike

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.490 
before I put them on the bike
it<00:02:55.129> looks<00:02:55.340> pretty<00:02:55.780> straightforward<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.260> how

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it looks pretty straightforward and how

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.460 
it looks pretty straightforward and how
fit<00:02:57.799> I'm<00:02:58.190> gonna<00:02:58.430> go<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.840> clean<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.989> bike<00:03:00.139> now

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
and and put them on so I probably won't

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.110 
and and put them on so I probably won't
post<00:03:06.260> a<00:03:06.410> video<00:03:06.530> over<00:03:06.950> fitting<00:03:07.549> them<00:03:07.760> because
