00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.810
 ok now we are dealing with theirs 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.270
 high tech and what is important in one 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.820
 party day is something different at 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.400
 a yeast dough is the temperature that 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:33.040
 it is cold ie cold cold butter 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.040
 cold plant fat cold water everything 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.199
 Can if you ever lie for a furniture 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.250
 shows that the butter should be warm 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.790
 do not know what does not work first 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.690
 I had to go there and come 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.890
 two tablespoons of sugar does not just enter 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 a little taste but also a 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.519
 bit of color and a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.729
 as well as with a recipe 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:11.770
 that will be mixed together and 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.509
 now comes very cold butter cubes and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 Those are not too thick was windows too 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.329
 thick is there you have to machine 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.710
 work a bit too much and they are 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:23.380
 cut relatively thin but not so 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.530
 Thin it with the layers easily 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.869
 of flour and merge 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.310
 I also take a little vegetable fat 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.270
 to one can take on throws 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 title becomes ettrich and that is that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.920
 the point with short crust is that it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.250
 layers are between butter and flour 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.130
 and if the butter gets too warm then 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.950
 these layers are broken that want 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.960
 we do not 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 I can also paint that by hand or 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.390
 I do not take a machine when I do that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.460
 to do by hand 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.130
 I take my fingertips because mine 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.409
 Fingertips are cold and fall 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.289
 I would work that in very quickly 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.369
 but because I have a nice story 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.429
 I leave the machine for myself 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.410
 do not do that anyway as soon as the with 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.069
 China is one you really have to look 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.900
 that it is not incorporated too much 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.959
 otherwise it is broken otherwise you can 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.209
 do nothing anymore 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 we look let us stay put 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.440
 that work in a bit 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.840
 if it is incorporated something comes 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.840
 cold water we do 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.540
 ok i hope you could see that 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.430
 is a bit worked on that is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.320
 fat but it is still very crude 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.600
 that we want now lets the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.520
 running machine now comes completely cold 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.060
 Add water and then I'll show you how 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.060
 it continues 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.349
 okay i do not scare i know 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.580
 always looks pretty catastrophic 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:14.030
 but I promise you will be papac now 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.680
 this is our paixao 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.500
 I could do it a bit either 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.610
 click together in the bowl or me 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.060
 do that on the work surface now 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.840
 so you can see first what I am 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.420
 to do that here is exactly right because 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.790
 I still have this bit of 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.459
 butter and flour and now I have to be very 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.459
 efficiently knead this together 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.709
 but you also quite clearly 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.670
 can see 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.530
 are really that bit of fat 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.819
 so is a perfect nice round shape 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.860
 Now I like to take one 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.769
 vegetable box ok , no one class 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.650
 training but I'll show you I do 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.790
 Just go in here and I can 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.269
 know again 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.010
 not only not on the right side 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:11.000
 occurred 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.519
 i find the system and then i do 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.950
 That really is at least two hours in 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.829
 the refrigerator cold dough can be 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.440
 perfect clean out warm day of practice 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.560
 not yet to start because it is part 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.669
 top teams give it their all back so now 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.669
 the poet
