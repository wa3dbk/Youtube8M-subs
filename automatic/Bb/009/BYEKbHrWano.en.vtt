 This time it is unusual how it is game related 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:16.219

 It's no good if you don't charge because you have been asleep for a long time 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.810

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.060

 So what if you look at amazon 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.740
 It was around 300 yen, but the charger is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.950
 Because 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.380
 This time whether the super cheap charger can be used properly 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.450
 I want to test 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.480

 Only contains Tara Hutong that are not wrapped anything to Petit Petit 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.320
 I want you to use your mind a little more because it is a mechanical one 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.230
 Do not be helped because not the Amazon are you very exhibition 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 Three times is different 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.850
 It 's not because of the Amazon 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.260
 Yes it is here 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.650
 Something like a genuine charger 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.420
 You have made it look like this 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.100
 And so this charger a seems to be usable overseas 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.200
 It is written in the title of the product like this 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 I is written in the wind that You're overseas can be used in the wind that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:28.840
 I can't try a bit because I never go abroad 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 Well then let's open this up 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.940
 Not enter Arekore scissors 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.730
 Do not enter in the morning 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.730
 There is no such school 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.140
 No way to go out and come out 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.080
 I took it out of the bag 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.910
 Then let's charge immediately 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.200
 First, connect this 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.910
 Good 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.020
 Plug in 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.020
 This is a really painful day 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.060
 Kedomo long is the part of this pin is long I I'm stuck even this in the eyes full 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.849
 I 'm jumping out like this 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.849
 Well, does the power supply come in properly? 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.230
 Power 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.010
 o Two- way method twitter 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.580
 That 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.580
 13 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.569
 Yeah met 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.050
 But what happens after a moment 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.590
 Ne Ja because of the cable 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.569
 Maybe the condition of the body is bad 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.980
 Useless 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.930
 That's it for a moment , though 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.940
 Hmmm 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.950
 I'm going to do some marooning with the motor Marlowe 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.880
 The power falls off before the screen gets mild 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 Oh no 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.790
 Also will I 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.880
 I wonder why it's because of the body I wonder because of the cable 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.820
 I wonder if from stab in What octopus legs 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.820
 Let us and went to the battle ax of a normal child without'm lecturer 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.570
 Don't matter 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.570
 Don't move! 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.580
 In this way 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:40.169
 I was thrown out because of the immobile cable 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.169
 If left for a while 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.110
 I was allowed to stand for about a is now ne 1 hour 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:54.979
 I'm going to change it with the cable inserted 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:58.280
 It has moved properly , and it seems that the battery is completely zero, etc. 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:04.790
 It looks like it will take some time 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.840
 And even if the battery is removed and only the external power supply is working like this 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.020
 Because 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:15.940
 The problem is unlikely to Apparently power supply itself 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.569
 I Toka Ne used until a little while ago unflattering 哈is not it called the unexpected ever fall 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.169
 It is this 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.300
 I can't go here 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.680
 Properly have been charged 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.740
 Like this 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.740
 You can use it to supply a ー ー っ ー 大丈夫 柄 柄 柄 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:40.400
 Yes, this time it was an introduction of this super cheap charge cable 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:47.340
 Even though I bought in wonder and I wonder I wonder how a so cheap 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:53.639
 Unexpectedly it seems to be able to be used normally Only if the speed is slower than 10 years of pure iron 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.600
 There is a possibility that there may be some, I do not know about that because it is not pure after all 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.780
 But 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:04.840
 Because I do not think To somehow check ne of the voltage 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.940
 I don't know, but with the battery removed, it just struggles with just the external power supply 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.990
 Because 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.640
 no problem 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:16.180
 Cheap goods I think I know this hell's that place say it Deko 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.800
 Of course I'm sorry I'm writing in a maid-in- China like this 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:24.020
 There is a miss hit 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.440
 If you lose your hand, there is a possibility that you will be sent out something that can not be used from the beginning 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.050
 I will 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.680
 Maybe 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:38.440
 There is also the possibility that this is just the answer. 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:41.030
 Always those who seem to about Well No, even draw should I self-responsibility when buying because 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.210
 We recommend that you but to buy 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:51.250
 Those who never want to do something like a lottery 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:52.230
 We recommend that you buy what price was properly because there are various ways in goods outside 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.400
 I will 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.850
 Well then 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.850
 Hey Well 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.830
 Ah ah ah 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.540
