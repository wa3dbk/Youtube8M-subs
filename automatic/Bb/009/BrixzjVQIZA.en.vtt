00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.150
 the starting position for both teams was equal to 19 points in the current 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.710
 Table often knew, however, wanted from the beginning with a closed 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.729
 Team performance decide the game for themselves and succeeded first 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.489
 Stroke before the ECJ has Zetor and Kevin Lavallee with the one to zero 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.300
 and it went on like this 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 after the 2 2 0 by moderation 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 if this situation 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.559
 after a buyer Packard Füssen in the majority and Raphael Rohwedder after all 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.559
 the three to zero somehow pure 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 A comfortable guide these days has nothing to do with it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.750
 mean 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.580
 Füssen belonged only to the first ten minutes of the third after that began 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.300
 Assault of the table last 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 Valentin Scharpf worried that three to one in the twelfth minute of the game 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 later then the next hit 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 the Packard with the 13 2 Klostersee was back 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.159
 Füssen was driving now 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 unnecessary bad luck of owners and he pulls top scorer Braydon Cox with that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.039
 Too easy 3 to 3 balance in the thirteenth minute of the game 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.090
 Fuss splendor now laden Scharpf loaded under scorer salad 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.110
 the entire eV VdF ENSI will be 13 4 just before the end of the first round 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.100
 for the recovered exciter gear the Compact should be even worse 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.820
 become 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.630
 27 minutes to play Hackert on salad 3 to 5 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.159
 Füssen had given the game completely out of hand in just a few minutes 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.310
 biggest problem of the hosts the defensive work 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.790
 then the 33 minute of the game the TV voiced you advised to a shooting gallery 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.950
 Salow Falkert and he does the 3 2 6 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.749
 Klostersee was actually through after the second third 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.469
 The third third began as the second had stopped Jared Mudryk with the 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.659
 three to 7 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.059
 but whatever you accuse the Füssener team ten of the fighting spirit 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.099
 is not the problem of the leopard the hosts tried to bite back 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.659
 and that succeeded Michel Maassen with the animal to 7 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:38.829
 then this situation guestkeeper real woman the footn Friedel and the 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.829
 remains after a stroke first lie 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.499
 the result of the goalie of Eat the Klostersee received a five minutes 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499
 Plus playing time penalty incomprehension with the guests 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:55.189
 against little warmed substitute goalkeeper Scharnagel then used the hosts 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.189
 her chances Eickmann with the 5 to 7 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.680
 and that's not enough 53 minutes of play Friedel with the sex to 7 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.980
 Connections Füssen again but that used nothing more Klostersee 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.810
 the leadership held the analysis of the defeat 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.669
 from around the son 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:17.749
 Outlines are just not stable enough there could be a goal two goals 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.709
 then it just goes way too easy to press, of course, that she already leaves 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.259
 already the round of the crew of the Westside shot in it what should one do then 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.339
 make a coach and of course the team here to further 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:28.109
 course 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.469
 pm Meppen the simple pass play around on Beust 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.099
 it is all logistic episode there must be more cribs third has more 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.439
 Tribe of team play together again so that then the game 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.069
 but researches again turns 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.529
 and these are great what makes me happy not to hang your heads 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.660
 Füssen ends the year as Table 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.469
 and the tasks for next year are clear 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.409
 where are Wulfen and now he has space to think about how 2010 will continue 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.629
 should
