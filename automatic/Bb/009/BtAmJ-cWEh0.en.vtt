00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 for all the guys here orgasms that I am 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.490
 here with a new scoop builder like me 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.379
 been asked 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.559
 in the episode in the previous video of the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.070
 club tour to make a team containing 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.570
 team of the season and maria thistles 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.369
 so he wanted to make this team that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 it is very strong and very competitive 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.109
 fun to use good quality 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.970
 but above all it is composed of five 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.310
 sampled five different nationalities 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 which makes it a good hybrid used 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 the 4 4 ​​1 1 as you can see I repeat 150 thousand 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 times is my favorite form of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 ultimate team and therefore more use 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.440
 this during the videos of the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.989
 teams etc. and so on 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 let's leave immediately then by the porter who 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.230
 it really is a top porter ie we was 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.610
 probably the strongest goalkeeper of the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.379
 I didn't play this year yet 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 used among other things, however, in four 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.520
 matches that so many of you did 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 bailouts that just make it one 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.550
 of the best goalkeepers if not the best 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.649
 game goalkeeper the price is a lot 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.879
 high but the player is very very strong 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.820
 and it is worth all of them 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.010
 then we go with the right-back the two 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.769
 fullbacks are a bit so learning for 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.560
 make agreement more than anything else though 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.930
 they compensate you will see the two defenders 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.720
 central now I don't remember with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.720
 silvio here it is of the benfica that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.479
 however it is not bad here are there 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 worst fullbacks in my opinion he is not the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.290
 maximum of life does not have a big one 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.710
 speed does n't even have much values 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 tall 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 in the rest of the statistics this is a 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.050
 classic silver player who instead 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.870
 however it is 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.580
 and however gold is even worse 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.880
 then we go to see the first defender 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.620
 central in order oh well awaits him 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 you can also put you too 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.220
 reversing the two plants does not do much 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.730
 boateng difference is really strong 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 this is the upgrade version if I 'm not mistaken 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.840
 fast and strong in good physical defense 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
 just high work really a good one 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.680
 player that I recommend of course 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.970
 try if you haven't done it yet 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.620
 and his departmental companion of his 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.660
 also team mate among others 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.130
 in the bayern that is benatia as I told you 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.850
 you can reverse as much does not do much 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.980
 difference 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 the only problem with this player 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.820
 besides the fact that to me a little less 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.620
 boa speed theme anyway i 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.780
 players are very similar to each other 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.840
 tm is also stronger than the physical defenses 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.640
 in that respect it is this other work 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.710
 high then high attack of vaults 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 a bit out of position and in some cases 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.180
 it has made itself felt, however, all in all it is 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.940
 an almost insurmountable couple indeed 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.650
 very strong while the left back 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.990
 I used another not rare player 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450
 I repeat, in order to make an understanding, but it is not 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.600
 even badly, that is ansaldi 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.280
 of the athletic madrid that however is one 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.500
 good speed and good values ​​of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.920
 defense and physical so it's not bad 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.040
 ok let's go see me, it's choking 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.900
 let's see the two central midfielders 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.520
 I also used here I think I do 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 little difference in the order in which there 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.090
 put I used fernandinho from one 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.560
 part that I liked very much the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.959
 statistics, however, are not there 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.670
 very good four games a goal and two 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.739
 really assists thumb up for this 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.600
 player that I liked so much and that 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.400
 however in addition to defending much attacks 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.250
 also enough 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.470
 while his department mate is there 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.410
 among other things, a change of role 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.330
 because he doesn't tell us if I find it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.170
 here it is fernando which by the way does 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.670
 triple agreement there is to open a to say 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.260
 so many things about this player 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.320
 it must be said that this is perhaps better 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.670
 put it on the right for obvious reasons 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.300
 he is a player who defensively 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.130
 very strong there is a bulwark takes them 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.560
 there was also a goal among other things though 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.850
 when the ball mammamia hands in 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.480
 hair is slow ie not fast and at a 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.500
 pretty poor pass a pass 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.150
 terrible you never set to 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.760
 this player rather swept by 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.050
 because it opens up to opposing counter-attacks 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.700
 also incredible there is two stars 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.900
 folding that are very bad though 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.260
 however it is from the point of view 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.850
 defensive and strong then we go with 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.320
 on the outside of the right I used salvio che 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.030
 that the club didn't have it so I have 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.800
 used because I liked the last one 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.960
 the last time I used it he got me 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.040
 made a goal maybe even that yes estimates 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.120
 he did in these games 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.470
 however I must say that it is a good one 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.910
 player from against pies from a good 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.160
 dribbling control is worth a discreet 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.470
 shooting etcetera etc. so yes maybe 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.150
 take it not in vain but not in shape 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.220
 however he is a very good player 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.560
 while on the opposite side as external 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.240
 left or used pablo piatti 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.100
 upgrade version this year not 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.380
 I still tried I used it in 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.580
 in the scared years that was silver and me 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.260
 really liked this year 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.930
 strangely I had not yet tried it 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.210
 but I advise you to do it because fast 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.250
 counter-attack and are really strong with 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.990
 he and above all a dribbling control 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.850
 really wonderful ball too 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.650
 some sinful stability that has a good 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.480
 right painful with two foot stars 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.260
 weak and then the players all 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.650
 that is, we know how to act and used of 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.390
 maria really a top four player 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.160
 matches and 4 goals and three assists means 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.870
 that you are really strong 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.690
 the only problem was the foot 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.919
 weak that you can do without 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.350
 the only problem with this player is 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.820
 high defense work which brings him back 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.370
 very often times outside 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.810
 position when you attack and when 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.400
 you are under that maybe you have to score 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.930
 sometimes he is always a bit 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.530
 behind you make a little effort to recover 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.419
 however it is very fast and very fast dribbling 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.890
 portentous four famous many a 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.200
 great shot also made me some 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.940
 right goal sometimes the other is a 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.260
 great move so this is it 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.560
 truly a formidable player 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.800
 really and then to conclude we have the 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.580
 our goal machine that is icardi 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.780
 really strong had said 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.639
 Russian entitles black ii 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.230
 that this player was really strong 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.389
 and really it really is 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.040
 is a player who has among other things a 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.960
 good ball control that you don't 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.460
 I was waiting and when he lost the ball anyway 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.320
 always try to recover it and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.100
 sometimes he recovers it and so it is a lot 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:55.040
 facilitated in this fast enough 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.020
 fast 87 practically foolproof shooting 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.850
 when you also pull left between 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.350
 the other is practically never wrong 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.480
 it is a decent passage at a 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.730
 striker a good dribbling and a 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.090
 excellent physically, unfortunately, of course they are 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.980
 those two star skills that a pole 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.840
 how to say, however, penalize it is 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.000
 really strong other work at the 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.740
 perfect then really a player from 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.410
 trying kids doesn't even cost that much 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.300
 I think so try it because there is none 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.860
 regret the team anyway 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.380
 this I hope you liked me is 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.510
 liked it as a team I have enough 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.370
 amused by using it as always vi 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.229
