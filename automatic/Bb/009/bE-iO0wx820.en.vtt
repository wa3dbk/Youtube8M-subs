 first impressions of an external hd 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:24.750

 free though it is sealed again 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 behave seal the box 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 not all in Portuguese said 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 in the box that the product is manufactured in 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.289
 zone of manaus has one year of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:01.800
 Next warranty Brazil can even measure 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:04.670
 17 mm high by 13 points 5 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.670
 centimeters in length 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:33.479
 now must pack well resistant balls 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:36.990
 and comes with usb 3.0 cable that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.580
 also fits any usb 2.0 port 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 logically that reconciles the 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.450
 speed and the ideal is always to use 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.110
 in USB 3.0 port to achieve the maximum 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 hd performance is a day of teaching and comes 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:10.350
 with a hd that shows you about the options 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:12.290
 USB connection 2.0 and 3.0 price and offered 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.180
 worldwide warranty 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.010
 only they are currently offering 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.810
 national warranty or you need to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.090
 have bought the device in Brazil with 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.780
 Brazilian tax bill to achieve 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.829
 claim the right before one year 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:35.910
 unlike other brands such as 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:39.530
 independent world where you have intel 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:49.650
 purchased your product the warranty will 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:55.100
 Depending on the way it is simple to 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.100
 a frosted rigid plastic gantry 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.730
 I liked the finish with her that the option 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.040
 to put a cord and the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.460
 interesting also that the usb port and 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.510
 connection she had the side is not behind 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.870
 with it the models on the side has 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.960
 a led indicates the functioning badge 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.820
 of the following 4 feet and gouache plus one 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:34.190
 once unselected in a free zone of 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:39.320
 Manaus is rap and I found 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:44.140
 interesting that of the next 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.140
 manufacture rock models 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.640
 here we can make a comparison of 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.640
 size between the model is a flex model 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:04.610
 has a terabyte USB 3.0 is as follows 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:10.970
 you can see that the flex model is 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:20.780
 smaller and also really a bit more 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:23.560
 fine worktop flex seems to have a 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.360
 more refined finish 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:34.669
 although I do not have the feet I think 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:38.260
 is missing on top of a flex model comes 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.260
 with a connector 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.919
 which can be replaced by 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:53.229
 interfaces was hero and just changing 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:57.180
 this connector bring more originally 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.180
 it comes with usb 3.0 interface 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.419
 but both are good to head and go 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:08.319
 very well regarding aspects 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.479
 visual negatives I just found that the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:14.080
 finishing a little weak 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.419
 given that those of samsung of the same 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.500
 specification in a well- finished 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.810
 on the housing and another point 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.539
 also negative that I see in several 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:32.710
 models of times is the length of the 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:41.080
 usb 3.0 cable flex cable and this is the case 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:43.690
 of the species that comes with it may 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.250
 also note that it is a small car 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.080
 if you have an output port of 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.300
 back in your case is really 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:55.860
 complicated to connect in a simple way 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.860
 juggling on the connection 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.080
 depending on where you are usb port 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.949
 3.0 his cabinet was large and did not stay 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:12.300
 on the edge on top of the personal cabinet 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:17.050
 this was boxing with first impressions 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:20.590
 in the next hd extension of 500 gigabytes 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.099
