00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.610
 I present you a tweak that will be 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.040
 soon available on cydia 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 his name is paul hus and he's going to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.369
 allow to customize the four 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.320
 shortcuts that we have here down in the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.210
 revenue control center 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 shortcuts to native applications 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.980
 mans we are here that 4 the torch the clock 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.330
 the calculator and the camera is 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 well with paul hus you'll see we 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.050
 will be able to improve all that so 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 its dedicated section is found here 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.899
 several options 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 so we'll start there to 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.270
 moment four applications are 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 ticked so these are the four 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.399
 shortcuts for the apps that I 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.410
 have just spoken to you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 and if you want to add more 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 shortcuts you simply tick them 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 applications for which you want 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.600
 a destination for example here facebook 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.129
 instagram and the phone so here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.809
 now in addition to the four shortcuts 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 latif if I slide to the right 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 this is what appears but three more 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.579
 facebook shortcuts 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.079
 instagram and the phone if I press 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.120
 above it opens the application 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 besides that the tweak is true but 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 well designed since very aesthetic 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.799
 look at you see that little ones 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.330
 shortcuts take the icon of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.470
 the application automatically without one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.909
 needs to do anything 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's really practical 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.540
 and if we go back to the settings of the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.010
 hole that we find here an option that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.420
 account it is put to eaunes sort the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.220
 shortcuts by order of last 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.390
 openings look at the phone itself 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 place first since I come 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 open it and if on the other hand I go 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.820
 the option the order is different the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 phone is on the second page 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.990
 learns the order that is here this order 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.130
 precisely you can modify it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 you just have to take the small 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.640
 shortcut and place it at the position 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 you prefer you can also in 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.509
 disable some for example 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 the clock and here it will be different 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.049
 what does it look like the phone is in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 first the watchmaker disable so you 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.890
 can you organize it like that? 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 arrange and also define the number of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.950
 shortcuts you want to watch 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.329
 day two per page and I obliged 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 slid each time to display 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.610
 several at least you can in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.130
 to put 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.049
 we are at most 6 look how that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 so get up there is all tight it's 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 not really pretty 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.729
 I'd rather put 4 like these 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.899
 posters and natively and slide towards 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.490
 the right or to the left for all 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.280
 displayed i can also activate or 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.659
 disable pagination and choose that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 every time I leave the center of 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.810
 control that land on the first 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.670
 shortcuts page 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.830
 and finally last option I can 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 display circle icons and up 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.590
 now the shortcuts were in 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.900
 buses and now they look like 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.250
 that in circles which reminds the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.430
 shortcuts for system settings in 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.870
 water 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 so it can be pretty cool 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.590
 choose this style of display so here is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.030
 how does it all work here you 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.069
 check the applications for which 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.569
 you want to activate a shortcut you 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.010
 have a list of all applications 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.599
 which are installed on your device 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.430
 whether it is native that it comes from 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.410
 cydia or the app store you do 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.910
 your little selection and then that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.739
 appears in your control center 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.209
 then as we saw earlier 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.950
 you have two choices for the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.150
 style either circles or gap and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.280
 if you uncheck this option 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.989
 and of course you can choose the order 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.819
 display shortcuts for example 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.390
 here cydia first facebook in 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.920
 second 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.360
 so we still have a lot of options 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.870
 of customization it's really 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.330
 pleasant 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.920
 and finally last possibility we have 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.489
 with this tweak is that I really find 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.080
 excellent 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.910
 it's when we go into the section of a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.950
 shortcut especially for example here 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.660
 facebook you see we have two actions 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.130
 possible according to what we do if we 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.319
 press a little bit it will open 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.980
 the application and if we press and we 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.290
 supported guard 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.280
 it could do something else for example 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.930
 if I press a little bit it opens 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 the facebook app but i'm going 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.709
 choose for a long press a 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.120
 active action wrong so there it will be 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.400
 plus opening the app that's getting 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.200
 but will produce something in here 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.819
 list of everything that is possible and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.140
 to stay consistent with the shortcut 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.850
 I will choose the composition of a 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.390
 post so when I press the 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.069
 small icon 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.959
 this is what the app is showing 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.609
 facebook so I louvre by pressing a 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.680
 little bit and if I support and that I 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.790
 guard press the app will not open 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.889
 not but a composition window 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.840
 fast there I'll be able to get in a 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.030
 message is very easily publish it 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 on my facebook wall like this thanks to this 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 little place shortcut is here in the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.739
 bone control center is with two 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.420
 possible options 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.829
 you can do that for all 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.750
 shortcuts that you will define that you 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.010
 add here thanks to paul hus we went 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.030
 really a feature that I 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.069
 finds excellent 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.450
 it allows you to have a lot of 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.670
 features in your center of 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.859
 bone control is that for all your 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.690
 applications and look at you and we 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.790
 can also customize the icon that 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.319
 will be displayed for this shortcut there by 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.019
 example for my phone application 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.519
 I choose this little icon here and that 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.079
 automatically applies now 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.150
 this is how the icon of the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.919
 phone so that's really the big thing 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.630
 highlight of this tweak the hymn to 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.040
 customization possibilities thanks 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.600
 to the hits 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.730
 customize you see all the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.710
 applications are supported almost there 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.030
 are a lot of choices and you 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.450
 will inevitably find what you 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.790
 interested 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.200
 it is very practical launching 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.570
 does very quickly thanks to 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.940
 shortcuts and this tweak is so paul 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.500
 hus like these it will be very soon 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.630
 available on cydia as I was 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.060
 said it will likely cost a 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.530
 dollar on the source of big boss and he 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 will be compatible with any 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.880
 iphone ipod touch or ipad jailbroken 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.130
 soyaux s is so tell me what you 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.600
 have thought about it in the comments and to 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.110
 very soon for a next 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.110
 Hi
