knitting and if you can see the stitches

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
knitting and if you can see the stitches
it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.699> different<00:00:29.939> kind<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> stitching<00:00:33.380> so

although it's in this red might want to
be<00:02:45.819> careful<00:02:45.850> washing<00:02:46.420> ever<00:02:46.840> anything<00:02:47.140> else

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
be careful washing ever anything else

the<00:02:48.610> dynamite<00:02:49.180> come<00:02:49.360> off

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.670 

crochets<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:03.120> faster<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> uses

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
crochets a little faster if but it uses

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.640 
crochets a little faster if but it uses
up<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.100> lot<00:03:05.130> more<00:03:05.460> yarn<00:03:06.290> because<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.620> every

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
up a lot more yarn because for every

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.760 
up a lot more yarn because for every
stitch<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.240> need<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> little<00:03:10.380> bit<00:03:10.620> more

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
stitch this you need a little bit more

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.880 
stitch this you need a little bit more
yarn<00:03:11.130> than<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.430> knitting<00:03:11.760> stitch<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:13.740> this

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
yarn than a knitting stitch and this

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.910 
yarn than a knitting stitch and this
little<00:03:14.100> tighter<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:17.430> thicker

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
little tighter I think little thicker

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:43.070 
little tighter I think little thicker
then<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.310> stitch<00:03:22.220> would<00:03:23.220> be

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.170 

because<00:03:43.800> I'll<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.130> show<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.460> one<00:03:44.820> round

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
because I'll just show you one round

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
because I'll just show you one round
because<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:48.120> could<00:03:48.360> seem<00:03:48.630> boring<00:03:49.110> when<00:03:49.530> you're

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
because it could seem boring when you're

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.470 
because it could seem boring when you're
looking<00:03:50.010> at<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.340> but<00:03:50.670> it's<00:03:53.240> meditative<00:03:54.240> but

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
looking at it but it's meditative but

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.410 
looking at it but it's meditative but
also<00:03:54.630> you're<00:03:55.440> thinking<00:03:55.970> about<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.240> may

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
also you're thinking about it may

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:20.960 
also you're thinking about it may
focusing<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.770> attention

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.730 

now<00:04:21.970> see<00:04:22.270> if<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.660> show<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.020> how<00:04:23.500> this

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
now see if I can show you how this

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.490 
now see if I can show you how this
actually<00:04:23.980> works<00:04:25.470> okay<00:04:26.470> so<00:04:26.920> i<00:04:28.290> don't<00:04:29.290> know<00:04:29.410> if

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
actually works okay so i don't know if

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.720 
actually works okay so i don't know if
you<00:04:29.620> already<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.850> close<00:04:31.060> up<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.570> them

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
you already can see to close up but them

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.770 
you already can see to close up but them
so<00:04:34.050> stitch<00:04:35.700> single<00:04:36.700> crochet<00:04:36.880> stitch<00:04:37.240> goes

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
so stitch single crochet stitch goes

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.310 
so stitch single crochet stitch goes
into<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:39.210> guess<00:04:40.210> loop<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.290> loop

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
into this I guess loop and the loop

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.350 
into this I guess loop and the loop
underneath<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.250> stitch<00:04:43.020> right<00:04:44.790> now<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:45.940> pull

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
underneath the stitch right now you pull

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.190 
underneath the stitch right now you pull
the<00:04:46.630> yarn<00:04:46.900> is<00:04:47.140> a<00:04:47.200> yarn<00:04:47.650> over<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.510> then<00:04:49.510> you

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
the yarn is a yarn over and then you

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.720 
the yarn is a yarn over and then you
pull<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:51.180> through<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:53.490> underneath<00:04:54.490> that

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
pull it through that underneath that

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.480 
pull it through that underneath that
stitch<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.690> then<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:57.030> yarn<00:04:58.030> over<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:59.490> you

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
stitch and then you yarn over and you

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.490 
stitch and then you yarn over and you
pull<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:01.090> through<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.540> two<00:05:01.750> loops<00:05:01.780> that<00:05:02.260> are

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
pull it through the two loops that are

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.660 
pull it through the two loops that are
on<00:05:02.950> here<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:04.510> then<00:05:05.110> bring<00:05:05.320> it<00:05:05.410> out<00:05:05.560> now<00:05:06.280> that's

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
again see that that little holes there

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.550 
again see that that little holes there
that's<00:05:13.020> underneath<00:05:14.020> one<00:05:14.530> stitch<00:05:15.120> yes<00:05:16.120> he<00:05:16.560> does

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
that's underneath one stitch yes he does

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.880 
that's underneath one stitch yes he does
say<00:05:17.830> i<00:05:17.860> get<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.460> whole<00:05:19.620> don't<00:05:20.620> want<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.800> make

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
say i get a whole don't want to make

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.590 
say i get a whole don't want to make
that<00:05:21.040> hole<00:05:21.250> too<00:05:21.490> big<00:05:22.650> so<00:05:23.650> again<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.370> know<00:05:24.600> and

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
that hole too big so again you know and

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.820 
that hole too big so again you know and
this<00:05:25.690> is<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.900> way<00:05:26.020> i<00:05:26.050> do<00:05:26.200> y'all<00:05:26.470> know<00:05:26.620> where<00:05:26.800> I

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
this is the way i do y'all know where I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.260 
this is the way i do y'all know where I
mean<00:05:27.070> it's<00:05:27.310> probably<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.670> little<00:05:27.760> different

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
mean it's probably a little different

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.290 
mean it's probably a little different
from<00:05:29.010> what<00:05:30.010> I'm<00:05:30.130> supposed<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> do<00:05:30.670> but<00:05:31.000> anyway

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
from what I'm supposed to do but anyway

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.060 
from what I'm supposed to do but anyway
so<00:05:31.360> that's<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.960> yarn<00:05:32.140> over<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.470> pull<00:05:32.710> it

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
so that's the yarn over and pull it

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.810 
so that's the yarn over and pull it
through<00:05:33.660> there's<00:05:34.660> two<00:05:34.870> loops<00:05:35.430> another<00:05:36.430> yarn

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
through there's two loops another yarn

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.600 
through there's two loops another yarn
over<00:05:37.470> I'm<00:05:38.470> going<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.710> put<00:05:38.920> it<00:05:39.040> through<00:05:39.280> both

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
over I'm going to put it through both

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.710 
over I'm going to put it through both
loops<00:05:41.250> there<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.370> go<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:43.560> yep<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.940> keep<00:05:46.480> doing

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
loops there you go and yep so keep doing

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.220 
loops there you go and yep so keep doing
that<00:05:46.870> round<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.500> round

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.090

of the round where I place the marker so
I<00:06:54.440> know<00:06:54.590> that's<00:06:55.240> where<00:06:56.240> it<00:06:57.140> should<00:06:57.200> end<00:06:57.590> for

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
we're back to where we kind of sort of

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:16.090 
we're back to where we kind of sort of
started<00:07:10.190> from<00:07:11.170> okay<00:07:14.410> and<00:07:15.410> if<00:07:15.770> they<00:07:15.890> keep<00:07:16.040> doing

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
started from okay and if they keep doing

and then then I have to start doing the

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.270 
and then then I have to start doing the
legs<00:07:25.160> and<00:07:25.340> not<00:07:25.460> all<00:07:25.790> kinds<00:07:26.090> of<00:07:26.150> things<00:07:27.280> it's
