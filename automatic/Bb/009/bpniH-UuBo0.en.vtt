lay it on is just directly on top as
evenly<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.570> possible<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:56.449> was<00:00:57.449> punching<00:00:57.629> a

evenly as possible I was punching a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.430 
evenly as possible I was punching a
little<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:59.640> does<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:01.289> don't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
little bit it does that if it you don't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.969 
little bit it does that if it you don't
laid<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> exactly<00:01:02.399> even<00:01:03.619> nobody<00:01:04.619> deli<00:01:04.830> just

depending<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.250> thick<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
depending on how thick you want them I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
depending on how thick you want them I
use<00:01:20.299> four<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> six<00:01:21.689> sheets<00:01:21.930> whatever<00:01:22.560> my

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
little tartlet depending on your filling

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
little tartlet depending on your filling
how<00:01:27.090> heavy<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.570> especially<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.470> vanilla

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
how heavy it is especially the vanilla

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
how heavy it is especially the vanilla
mousse<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.490> make<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.119> moment<00:01:30.450> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
mousse which will make in a moment is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
mousse which will make in a moment is
really<00:01:31.350> light<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.520> don't<00:01:32.700> need<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> really

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
really light so you don't need a really

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.710 
really light so you don't need a really
thick<00:01:33.659> shell<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> does<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.210> piane<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
thick shell for that does a piane is a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.670 
thick shell for that does a piane is a
little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.140> heavier<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> will<00:01:40.350> make<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
little bit heavier but so I will make it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
little bit heavier but so I will make it
durable<00:01:40.920> enough<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> hold<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> bee<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
durable enough to hold it as a bee on it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.499 
durable enough to hold it as a bee on it
as<00:01:42.390> well<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.450> are

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
as well but these are these are

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
as well but these are these are
paper-thin<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.439> want<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.950> use<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
paper-thin so you want I would use you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:58.070 
paper-thin so you want I would use you
know<00:01:47.930> 45<00:01:49.579> sheets

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.580 

hmm

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.499 

two<00:02:01.770> minutes

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.399 

alright<00:02:11.730> next<00:02:12.730> sheet<00:02:13.120> you'll<00:02:13.870> see<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
alright next sheet you'll see there you

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.839 
alright next sheet you'll see there you
know<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.590> risks<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:14.950> natural<00:02:15.340> cracking<00:02:15.760> in

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
know the risks and natural cracking in

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.580 
know the risks and natural cracking in
the<00:02:15.939> sheet<00:02:16.180> really<00:02:16.720> not<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> big<00:02:17.079> deal<00:02:17.260> because

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the sheet really not a big deal because

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.929 
the sheet really not a big deal because
it's<00:02:17.890> all<00:02:18.329> being<00:02:19.329> bound<00:02:19.659> together<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:21.700> long<00:02:21.909> as

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
it's all being bound together as long as

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.059 
it's all being bound together as long as
you<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.209> those<00:02:22.360> edges<00:02:22.720> when<00:02:23.439> you<00:02:23.530> put<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.860> in

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
you get those edges when you put this in

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.180 
you get those edges when you put this in
