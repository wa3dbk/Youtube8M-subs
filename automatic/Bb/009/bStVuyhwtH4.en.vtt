edition
now<00:00:11.990> the<00:00:12.050> first<00:00:12.320> FuelBand<00:00:12.769> came<00:00:13.099> out<00:00:13.280> in<00:00:13.429> 2012

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
now the first FuelBand came out in 2012

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.380 
now the first FuelBand came out in 2012
not<00:00:15.019> too<00:00:15.380> much<00:00:15.620> has<00:00:15.980> changed<00:00:16.150> you've<00:00:17.150> got

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
not too much has changed you've got

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.999 
not too much has changed you've got
first<00:00:17.630> and<00:00:17.810> foremost<00:00:18.230> you've<00:00:18.439> got<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.619> button

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
first and foremost you've got a button

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.830 
first and foremost you've got a button
here<00:00:19.220> this<00:00:19.759> actually<00:00:19.970> shows<00:00:20.270> you<00:00:20.419> your<00:00:20.570> stats

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
here this actually shows you your stats

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.290 
here this actually shows you your stats
so<00:00:21.140> each<00:00:21.349> button<00:00:21.800> push<00:00:22.250> takes<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.090> through

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
so each button push takes you through

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.049 
so each button push takes you through
each<00:00:23.509> of<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.750> stack<00:00:23.989> now<00:00:24.619> there<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.520> total

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:26.059 
each of the stack now there is a total

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.310 
each of the stack now there is a total
of<00:00:26.210> four<00:00:26.660> stats<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.380> those<00:00:27.649> include<00:00:28.009> fuel

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
of four stats and those include fuel

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.880 
of four stats and those include fuel
calories<00:00:30.340> steps<00:00:31.340> and<00:00:31.730> hours<00:00:32.540> one<00:00:32.890> calories

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
calories steps and hours one calories

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.000 
calories steps and hours one calories
steps<00:00:34.280> pretty<00:00:35.060> straightforward<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:36.710> then

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
steps pretty straightforward and then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.400 
steps pretty straightforward and then
fuel<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.640> actually<00:00:38.120> a<00:00:38.150> number<00:00:38.480> calculated

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
fuel is actually a number calculated

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.430 
fuel is actually a number calculated
using<00:00:39.950> your<00:00:40.430> weight<00:00:40.820> height<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:41.840> age<00:00:42.110> and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
using your weight height and age and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.740 
using your weight height and age and
again<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:43.250> all<00:00:43.430> reflection<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.120> steps<00:00:44.420> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
again it's all reflection of steps and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.050 
again it's all reflection of steps and
calories<00:00:44.900> when<00:00:45.800> you<00:00:45.920> double<00:00:46.250> press<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.700> the

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
calories when you double press the the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.020 
calories when you double press the the

you<00:01:27.170> actually<00:01:27.560> have<00:01:27.770> doubling<00:01:28.490> within<00:01:28.790> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
you actually have doubling within the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.859 
you actually have doubling within the
class<00:01:29.090> system<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.290> USB<00:01:31.070> plug<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:32.390> last<00:01:32.630> for

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
class system is a USB plug so last for

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.090 
class system is a USB plug so last for
future<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.170> want<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.440> cover<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
future I want to cover is just the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.640 
future I want to cover is just the
accelerometer<00:01:34.729> it's<00:01:35.600> something<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.350> can't

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
accelerometer it's something you can't

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.880 
accelerometer it's something you can't
see

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
see

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.310 
see
and<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.580> just<00:01:38.150> measures<00:01:38.390> your<00:01:38.659> staff<00:01:38.869> accounts

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
and it just measures your staff accounts

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.690 
and it just measures your staff accounts
to<00:01:39.380> staff<00:01:39.560> every<00:01:39.799> time<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.130> move<00:01:40.280> forward<00:01:40.549> and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
to staff every time you move forward and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.250 
to staff every time you move forward and
it's<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.119> what<00:01:41.330> makes<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.840> fuel<00:01:42.080> band

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's really what makes the fuel band

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.070 
it's really what makes the fuel band
work<00:01:42.909> okay<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:43.970> next<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:44.720> want<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:44.960> do<00:01:45.049> a

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
work okay so next I just want to do a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.750 
work okay so next I just want to do a
quick<00:01:45.320> comparison<00:01:45.350> between<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.280> first<00:01:46.520> fuel

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
quick comparison between the first fuel

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.120 
quick comparison between the first fuel
band<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.570> second<00:01:48.260> edition<00:01:48.619> or<00:01:48.770> second

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
band and the second edition or second

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.250 
band and the second edition or second
tool<00:01:49.280> band<00:01:49.460> they're<00:01:50.240> effectively<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.990> same

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
tool band they're effectively the same

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.719 
tool band they're effectively the same
when<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:51.890> look<00:01:52.010> at<00:01:52.130> them<00:01:52.220> aesthetically

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
when you just look at them aesthetically

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.260 
so final thoughts look you know it's
hardware<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.010> software<00:03:45.160> right<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.150> far

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
hardware and software right and as far

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.270 
hardware and software right and as far
as<00:03:46.330> hardware<00:03:46.750> goes<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.140> fuel<00:03:47.380> band<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.800> doing

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
as hardware goes the fuel band is doing

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.040 
as hardware goes the fuel band is doing
it<00:03:48.430> probably<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.030> best<00:03:49.270> you've<00:03:49.570> got<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.840> cool

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
it probably the best you've got the cool

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.930 
it probably the best you've got the cool
white<00:03:50.200> LED<00:03:50.260> lights<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.250> better<00:03:51.430> clasping

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
white LED lights the better clasping

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.420 
white LED lights the better clasping
system<00:03:52.330> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:52.960> charge<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.350> anywhere<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.220> go

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
system you can charge it anywhere you go

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.790 
system you can charge it anywhere you go
in<00:03:55.150> terms<00:03:55.390> of<00:03:55.600> software<00:03:55.780> it's<00:03:56.170> almost<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.590> moot

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
in terms of software it's almost a moot

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.620 
in terms of software it's almost a moot
issue<00:03:57.010> right<00:03:57.820> because<00:03:58.120> nobody's<00:03:58.600> really

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
issue right because nobody's really

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.290 
issue right because nobody's really
doing<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.380> gamification<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.790> much<00:04:01.030> better

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
doing the gamification that much better

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.480 
doing the gamification that much better
than<00:04:01.510> somebody<00:04:01.750> else<00:04:02.110> all<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.220> do<00:04:03.340> is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
than somebody else all you can do is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.520 
than somebody else all you can do is
look<00:04:03.730> at<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.240> look<00:04:04.420> at<00:04:04.540> how<00:04:04.750> lazy<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.350> are

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
look at it and look at how lazy you are

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.980 
look at it and look at how lazy you are
and<00:04:05.710> that's<00:04:05.860> largely<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:06.910> these<00:04:07.270> apps<00:04:07.570> are

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
and that's largely what these apps are

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.210 
and that's largely what these apps are
intended<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.410> do<00:04:08.530> with<00:04:08.680> at<00:04:08.800> least<00:04:08.920> at<00:04:09.130> this

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
intended to do with at least at this

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.930 
intended to do with at least at this
point<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:10.440> because<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.980> continue<00:04:12.760> to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
point and because of that I continue to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.640 
point and because of that I continue to
this<00:04:13.060> day<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.390> go<00:04:13.750> back<00:04:13.960> to<00:04:14.140> where<00:04:14.260> in<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.440> fuel

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
this day to go back to where in the fuel

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:30.210 
this day to go back to where in the fuel
band

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.280
