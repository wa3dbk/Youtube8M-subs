00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that you actually there might be a CFG

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so you'll have to go and set it to be

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.750 
so you'll have to go and set it to be
open<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.740> word<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> notepad<00:01:12.350> something<00:01:13.350> I

recommend<00:01:56.700> changing<00:01:57.149> those<00:01:57.299> lets<00:01:57.990> you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
recommend changing those lets you

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
recommend changing those lets you
actually<00:01:58.259> how<00:01:58.500> much<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:58.710> doing<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.979> but

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
um morph you open up your morph and it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.560 
um morph you open up your morph and it
seemed<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> notepad<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
seemed a notepad right here then you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
seemed a notepad right here then you
scroll<00:02:06.869> throw<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> look<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.580> you

scroll throw you look what you want you
can<00:02:09.300> change<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
can change it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
can change it
and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.580> you've<00:02:11.700> come<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> way<00:02:12.330> down<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and then you've come all the way down to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.030 
and then you've come all the way down to
like<00:02:12.840> right<00:02:13.200> around<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:15.110> will<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.380> insta

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
like right around here will you insta

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.600 
like right around here will you insta
morph<00:02:17.250> into<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:18.030> new<00:02:18.300> morph<00:02:18.930> required

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
morph into a new morph required

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.140 
morph into a new morph required
acquired<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:21.210> this<00:02:21.510> basically<00:02:22.020> means<00:02:23.150> once

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
acquired now this basically means once

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.110 
acquired now this basically means once
you<00:02:24.300> kill<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> mob<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> creeper<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.060> you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
you kill a mob I like a creeper and you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.690 
you kill a mob I like a creeper and you
turn<00:02:27.420> into<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:28.050> mob<00:02:28.740> if<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.550> know<00:02:29.640> if

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
turn into that mob if you don't know if

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.270 
turn into that mob if you don't know if
the<00:02:29.790> morph<00:02:30.000> mod<00:02:30.150> does<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.690> basically<00:02:31.010> makes<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the morph mod does it basically makes it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.060 
the morph mod does it basically makes it
so<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.490> when<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.970> kill<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.080> certain<00:02:34.410> mob

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
so that when you kill in a certain mob

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.220 
so that when you kill in a certain mob
you<00:02:35.670> turn<00:02:35.910> into<00:02:36.120> them<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.450> get<00:02:36.810> abilities

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you turn into them and you get abilities

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.130 
you turn into them and you get abilities
from<00:02:37.410> them<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.330> once<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.450> first<00:02:39.750> kill<00:02:39.960> them

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
from them and once you first kill them

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.210 
from them and once you first kill them
for<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.380> first<00:02:40.530> time<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.800> turn<00:02:40.980> into<00:02:41.130> that

for the first time you turn into that

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.570 
for the first time you turn into that
mob<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.990> can<00:02:43.140> change<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.460> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
put it as one you will change that mob

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.430 
put it as one you will change that mob
when<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> feel<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.870> can<00:02:48.900> also<00:02:49.170> change
