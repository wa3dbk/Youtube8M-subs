today<00:00:04.529> was<00:00:04.710> pretty<00:00:04.890> breath<00:00:05.629> fishing<00:00:07.340> because

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
today was pretty breath fishing because

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.150 
today was pretty breath fishing because
of<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> constant<00:00:09.179> breeze<00:00:09.530> was<00:00:10.530> testing<00:00:11.040> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
of a constant breeze was testing the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.560 
of a constant breeze was testing the
furrow<00:00:11.429> blinds<00:00:12.500> you<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.710> see<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.330> had<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
furrow blinds you can see and I had a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.080 
furrow blinds you can see and I had a
constant<00:00:16.199> upstream<00:00:16.800> breeze<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.699> two

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
constant upstream breeze of about two

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.779 
constant upstream breeze of about two
seven<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.510> ten<00:00:18.720> miles<00:00:18.960> an<00:00:19.199> hour<00:00:19.550> because<00:00:20.550> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
seven to ten miles an hour because of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.740 
seven to ten miles an hour because of
this<00:00:21.020> difficulty<00:00:22.020> seeing<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.130> line

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
this difficulty seeing the line

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.060 
this difficulty seeing the line
tightened<00:00:24.750> when<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> fish<00:00:25.230> took<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.890> had

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
tightened when a fish took it so I had

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.999 
tightened when a fish took it so I had
to<00:00:26.189> use<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.730> small<00:00:28.670> piece<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.699> Rio<00:00:31.009> Kahuna

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
to use a very small piece of Rio Kahuna

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.760 
to use a very small piece of Rio Kahuna
as<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.969> cider<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.469> see

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
as a cider and then that way I could see

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:48.299 
as a cider and then that way I could see
a<00:00:37.800> fish<00:00:38.129> take<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.809> names

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:55.850 

I<00:00:51.120> tested<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.690> ten<00:00:53.440> kata<00:00:53.769> us<00:00:54.489> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I tested the ten kata us a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.009 
I tested the ten kata us a
third-generation<00:00:57.719> traditional<00:00:58.719> furrow

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019

there<00:01:02.469> first<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:04.440> also<00:01:05.440> looked<00:01:05.950> at<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.990> control

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
there first I also looked at the control

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.440 
there first I also looked at the control
leaders<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:09.130> mine<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.740> streamside<00:01:12.450> and
