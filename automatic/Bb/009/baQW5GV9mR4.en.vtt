00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a little awkward but I really I think as

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.069 
a little awkward but I really I think as
a<00:01:30.840> whole<00:01:31.880> it's<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.659> nice<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
really really well made the few maybe

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.600 
really really well made the few maybe
bad<00:01:39.329> qualities<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.710> case<00:01:40.950> itself<00:01:41.340> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bad qualities of the case itself I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.359 
bad qualities of the case itself I
really<00:01:42.420> overlooked<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really overlooked because of the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
really overlooked because of the
functionality<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
functionality of it because you know the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
functionality of it because you know the
workmanship<00:01:47.009> put<00:01:47.399> into<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> fact

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
workmanship put into it and the fact

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.719 
workmanship put into it and the fact
that<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.829> really<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> revolutionary

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
