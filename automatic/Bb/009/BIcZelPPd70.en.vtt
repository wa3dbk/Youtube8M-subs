dive into this and see some more your

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230 
dive into this and see some more your
programming<00:00:21.870> magic<00:00:22.260> awesome<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.060> we're

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
programming magic awesome so what we're

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.520 
programming magic awesome so what we're
going<00:00:24.360> to<00:00:24.480> do<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.900> we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> put

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
going to do is we're going to put

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.400 
going to do is we're going to put
together<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.930> three-dimensional<00:00:27.930> asteroids

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
together a three-dimensional asteroids

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.140 
together a three-dimensional asteroids
game<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> twist<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.880> with

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
game with a bit of a twist with with

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.350 
game with a bit of a twist with with
waypoints<00:00:30.780> so<00:00:31.350> basically<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.160> will<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
waypoints so basically we will have the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.530 
waypoints so basically we will have the
ability<00:00:33.449> to<00:00:33.780> move<00:00:34.170> our<00:00:34.380> ship<00:00:34.620> around<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.540> will

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ability to move our ship around and will

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.690 
ability to move our ship around and will
also<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.110> hitting<00:00:37.410> way<00:00:37.829> points<00:00:38.220> along<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> way

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
also be hitting way points along the way

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
also be hitting way points along the way
we'll<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.329> able<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.570> shoot<00:00:39.810> out<00:00:40.020> these

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we'll be able to shoot out these

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
we'll be able to shoot out these
asteroids<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.220> gain<00:00:41.520> points<00:00:41.850> however<00:00:42.630> we<00:00:43.170> have

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
asteroids to gain points however we have

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
asteroids to gain points however we have
to<00:00:43.649> hit<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> waypoints<00:00:44.430> before<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> timer

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to hit the waypoints before the timer

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
to hit the waypoints before the timer
runs<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.390> otherwise<00:00:46.220> you<00:00:47.220> will<00:00:47.370> lose<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
runs out otherwise you will lose the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.560 
runs out otherwise you will lose the
game<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:50.489> way<00:00:50.760> point<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.300> far

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
game and this way point is really far

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.370 
game and this way point is really far
away<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.910> gonna<00:00:54.030> lose<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.450> game<00:00:54.630> oh<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
away so you're gonna lose the game oh I

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.650 
away so you're gonna lose the game oh I
know<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.860> made<00:00:56.040> it<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.370> made<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.880> okay<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
know you made it I made it okay so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
know you made it I made it okay so
here's<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.410> second<00:00:58.860> level<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.309> you'll

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
here's our second level here you'll

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.250 
here's our second level here you'll
notice<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.300> speed<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> game<00:01:00.870> does

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
notice that the speed of the game does

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.299 
notice that the speed of the game does
increase<00:01:01.710> depending<00:01:02.700> on<00:01:03.170> depending<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.559> what

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
increase depending on depending on what

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
increase depending on depending on what
you<00:01:05.489> set<00:01:05.819> it<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.209> while<00:01:06.899> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.139> figure<00:01:07.289> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you set it to while you can figure the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.889 
you set it to while you can figure the
game<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.889> then<00:01:08.249> when<00:01:08.399> you<00:01:08.490> win<00:01:08.639> you<00:01:09.270> win<00:01:09.539> and

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
game and then when you win you win and

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.550 
game and then when you win you win and
you<00:01:10.139> can<00:01:10.289> give<00:01:10.469> yourself<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> score<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
you can give yourself a I score and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.039 
you can give yourself a I score and
everything<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.740> awesome<00:01:14.569> but<00:01:15.569> the<00:01:15.719> point<00:01:15.929> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
everything is awesome but the point of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.529 
everything is awesome but the point of
this<00:01:16.170> isn't<00:01:16.530> necessarily<00:01:17.249> about<00:01:17.539> this

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
this isn't necessarily about this

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.870 
this isn't necessarily about this
particular<00:01:18.959> game<00:01:19.289> we<00:01:19.439> put<00:01:19.649> together<00:01:19.880> instead

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
particular game we put together instead

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.910 
particular game we put together instead
what<00:01:21.240> we've<00:01:21.389> essentially<00:01:21.779> done<00:01:22.139> is<00:01:22.170> created

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
putting that together by putting our

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
putting that together by putting our
movement<00:01:44.459> in<00:01:44.609> place<00:01:44.849> our<00:01:45.090> camera<00:01:45.599> in<00:01:45.719> place

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
movement in place our camera in place

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
movement in place our camera in place
are<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.709> of<00:01:46.859> our<00:01:46.919> effects<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.639> some

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
are some of our effects in some

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
are some of our effects in some
framework<00:01:48.779> like<00:01:48.810> code<00:01:49.499> so<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.069> we<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.579> more

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
framework like code so that we can more

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.059 
framework like code so that we can more
easily<00:01:51.749> build<00:01:52.679> upon<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:54.149> create<00:01:54.749> our

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
easily build upon it to create our

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.219 
easily build upon it to create our
finished<00:01:56.069> product<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.899> cool

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
finished product it's really pretty cool

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.169

basically<00:01:58.889> we're<00:01:59.069> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.249> build<00:01:59.459> a<00:01:59.669> small

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
basically we're going to build a small

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.949 
basically we're going to build a small
game<00:02:00.539> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.979> 3d<00:02:02.520> asteroids<00:02:03.479> type<00:02:03.719> game

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
game kind of a to 3d asteroids type game
