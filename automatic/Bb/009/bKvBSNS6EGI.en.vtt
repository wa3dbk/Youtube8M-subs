00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.020
 and good 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello guys I hope you are very well and 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.240
 Today I bring you this design 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.460
 flowery so let's start first 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.370
 We apply protective base to our 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.040
 nails to protect them very very well 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.770
 then we apply two coats of enamel 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.760
 white do not forget that you must 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.890
 let dry very well between layer and layer 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.870
 then girls we put some enamel 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.080
 pink and with the tip of a 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.330
 we take a little bit and make a 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.790
 point on our nail then we put 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.400
 another bit of a stronger pink color 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.800
 or of the correct our prefer and with 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.530
 the tip of a toothpick we are going to draw 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.469
 the petals of our little flower 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.620
 here you must have a lot of patience and 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:57.269
 go painting them little by little but in the end 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.269
 your design will be very beautiful 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.339
 and well afterwards you can also use the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.399
 stick to draw the center of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.869
 flower and you can make the petals but 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.869
 Now using another color 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 one 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.020
 and so you can use the combination of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020
 colors that you like the most 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 then if you want to do it faster 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.420
 first you paint the points of the center of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.030
 your flowers and then with a toothpick 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.890
 You paint small dots around the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.409
 big points and that's how they are 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 petals and so it's a little faster 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.860
 it does not matter that you stay there a little bit 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.720
 ugly one petal that another at the end the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.720
 design is going to look very cool 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.119
 one 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.960
 Y 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 to 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:26.040
 finally we apply brightness to 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.040
 highlight our design and last us longer 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:34.350
 and that's the way it is our design with 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.760
 very showy flowers and very colorful well 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.710

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.540
