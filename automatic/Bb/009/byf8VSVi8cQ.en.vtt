hey<00:00:00.960> everyone<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.589> an<00:00:01.680> update<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.070> my<00:00:02.310> ex

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey everyone this is an update to my ex

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey everyone this is an update to my ex
helicopter<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.389> razor<00:00:03.629> 250<00:00:04.290> video<00:00:04.529> now<00:00:05.400> I

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
helicopter a razor 250 video now I

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.760 
helicopter a razor 250 video now I
finally<00:00:05.790> did<00:00:06.060> receive<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:07.350> flown<00:00:07.589> it

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
finally did receive it and I've flown it

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.709 
finally did receive it and I've flown it
about<00:00:07.980> five<00:00:08.280> times<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.360> those<00:00:09.480> five

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
about five times and in those five

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.499 
about five times and in those five
flights<00:00:10.110> I've<00:00:10.380> had<00:00:10.620> nothing<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.099> problems<00:00:11.509> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
flights I've had nothing but problems to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.450 
flights I've had nothing but problems to
begin<00:00:12.780> with<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.139> gyro<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> comes<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
begin with the gyro it comes with is the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.070 
begin with the gyro it comes with is the
gy<00:00:15.059> 190<00:00:15.710> Gy<00:00:16.710> 192<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> gyro<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
gy 190 Gy 192 this is the gyro that it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
gy 190 Gy 192 this is the gyro that it
came<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:20.029> it<00:00:21.029> would<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.359> work

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
came with and it would not work

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.830 
came with and it would not work
correctly<00:00:22.250> no<00:00:23.250> matter<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.820> much<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.510> tried

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
correctly no matter how much I tried

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.870 
correctly no matter how much I tried
setting<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> tail<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.070> had<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.460> all<00:00:26.550> set<00:00:26.580> up

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
setting up the tail I had it all set up

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
setting up the tail I had it all set up
perfect<00:00:27.359> mess<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.050> gyro<00:00:28.410> gain<00:00:28.650> no<00:00:29.640> matter

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
perfect mess with a gyro gain no matter

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
perfect mess with a gyro gain no matter
what<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.720> tail<00:00:31.080> would<00:00:31.349> drift<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
what the tail would drift you I think it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.299 
what the tail would drift you I think it
was<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> counterclockwise<00:00:33.780> wise<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.800> would

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
was to the counterclockwise wise I would

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.850 
was to the counterclockwise wise I would
always<00:00:35.550> drift<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> other<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
always drift one way or the other I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.690 
always drift one way or the other I
honestly<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.040> remember<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.399> way<00:00:38.579> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
honestly don't remember which way it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
honestly don't remember which way it
drifted<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> always<00:00:39.870> drifted<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.739> would

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
drifted but it always drifted it would

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520 
drifted but it always drifted it would
not<00:00:41.129> hold<00:00:41.370> steady<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> went<00:00:42.960> ahead<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.350> got

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
not hold steady so I went ahead and got

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.119 
not hold steady so I went ahead and got
another<00:00:43.980> cheap<00:00:44.370> gyro<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.600> gy4<00:00:46.140> TV<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:46.980> I've

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
another cheap gyro the gy4 TV which I've

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
another cheap gyro the gy4 TV which I've
heard<00:00:47.250> good<00:00:47.430> things<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.629> if

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
heard good things about you know if

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
heard good things about you know if
you're<00:00:48.780> gonna<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.110> extreme<00:00:49.590> 3d<00:00:49.920> pilot<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you're gonna be an extreme 3d pilot you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.520 
you're gonna be an extreme 3d pilot you
should<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> better<00:00:50.879> gyro<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
should get a better gyro but this one it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
should get a better gyro but this one it
seems<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.219> holding<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.120> better<00:00:54.329> than

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
seems to be holding a lot better than

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.010 
seems to be holding a lot better than
that<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.770> also<00:00:55.980> put<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:57.539> e<00:00:57.690> flight

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that one and I also put on an e flight

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.760 
that one and I also put on an e flight
digital<00:00:58.530> servo<00:00:58.949> DF<00:00:59.789> 75<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> tail<00:01:01.050> servo

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
digital servo DF 75 for the tail servo

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
digital servo DF 75 for the tail servo
because<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> stock<00:01:02.789> servo<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.329> analog<00:01:04.110> servo

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because the stock servo was analog servo

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
because the stock servo was analog servo
was<00:01:04.799> slow<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.909> very<00:01:06.119> strong<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.750> didn't

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
was slow not very strong it just didn't

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.210 
was slow not very strong it just didn't
work<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:07.799> either

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
work very good either

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.420 
work very good either
so<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.270> helped<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> tail<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.140> bit<00:01:10.430> but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so that helped the tail a little bit but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.149 
so that helped the tail a little bit but
then<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> started<00:01:12.030> noticing<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.810> major

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
then I started noticing some major

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.130 
then I started noticing some major
vibration<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.369> helicopter<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.299> would<00:01:15.900> take

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
vibration in my helicopter I would take

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
vibration in my helicopter I would take
it<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.380> start<00:01:16.650> flying<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.310> fine<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it up start flying it it was fine and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
it up start flying it it was fine and
then<00:01:17.939> halfway<00:01:18.270> through<00:01:18.450> my<00:01:18.720> flight<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> would

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
then halfway through my flight I would

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
then halfway through my flight I would
get<00:01:19.259> vibration<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.950> would<00:01:20.369> land<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.880> crazy

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
get vibration I would land it like crazy

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
get vibration I would land it like crazy
vibration<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.950> land<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.030> again

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
vibration I would land it take off again

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
vibration I would land it take off again
no<00:01:24.420> vibration<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.650> two<00:01:26.040> seconds<00:01:26.369> later

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
no vibration and then two seconds later

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.609 
no vibration and then two seconds later
tons<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.090> vibration<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> vibration<00:01:28.560> would

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
tons of vibration the vibration would

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.050 
tons of vibration the vibration would
start<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.040> stop<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.460> could<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.820> figure

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
start and stop and I could not figure

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179 
start and stop and I could not figure
out<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.570> well<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> found<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
out what it was well I found out it was

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.850 
out what it was well I found out it was
the<00:01:32.220> tail<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> I've<00:01:33.750> tried<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> fix<00:01:34.619> up<00:01:34.829> my

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the tail and I've tried to fix up my

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.929 
the tail and I've tried to fix up my
tail<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> put<00:01:36.360> some<00:01:36.509> splints<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.290> epoxy

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
tail here I put some splints in it epoxy

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
tail here I put some splints in it epoxy
metal<00:01:38.939> pieces<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:40.350> try<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> fix<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> tail

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
metal pieces to try to fix the tail

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
metal pieces to try to fix the tail
because<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> tail<00:01:42.090> actually<00:01:42.390> had<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> huge

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
because the tail actually had a huge

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.530 
because the tail actually had a huge
Bend<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.070> actually<00:01:44.220> cracked<00:01:44.790> without<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
Bend and it actually cracked without a

broken tail see what else was wrong with
it<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:47.329> think<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.390> covered<00:02:48.569> pretty<00:02:48.780> much

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

it I think I covered pretty much
everything<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.440> tail<00:02:49.650> horrible<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.819> weak

everything the tail horrible really weak

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
everything the tail horrible really weak
bends<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.720> breaks<00:02:51.930> easy<00:02:52.140> lots<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.620> vibration

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
bends and breaks easy lots of vibration

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.599 
bends and breaks easy lots of vibration
tail<00:02:54.030> servo<00:02:54.329> not<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:54.840> great<00:02:55.079> gyro<00:02:55.859> didn't<00:02:56.370> hold

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.589 
nothing now if you're gonna be building
a<00:03:44.549> helicopter<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.090> probably<00:03:45.389> know<00:03:45.480> what

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
a helicopter you probably know what

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.150 
a helicopter you probably know what
you're<00:03:45.690> doing<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.230> do<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.099> don't

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
you're doing like I do so you don't

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.849 
you're doing like I do so you don't
really<00:03:47.310> need<00:03:47.549> an<00:03:47.699> instruction<00:03:48.180> manual<00:03:48.209> but

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
really need an instruction manual but

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.020 
really need an instruction manual but
just<00:03:49.859> showing<00:03:50.129> me<00:03:50.220> nothing<00:03:50.370> comes<00:03:50.730> with<00:03:50.910> it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
just showing me nothing comes with it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.610 
just showing me nothing comes with it
it's<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.359> helicopter<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.049> canopy<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
it's just a helicopter the canopy the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.460 
it's just a helicopter the canopy the
blades<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.879> your<00:03:54.000> hardware<00:03:54.329> pack<00:03:54.569> now

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
blades and then your hardware pack now

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.220 
blades and then your hardware pack now
when<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.709> took<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.099> out<00:03:56.629> this<00:03:57.629> helicopter

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
when I took this out this helicopter

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.539 
when I took this out this helicopter
actually<00:03:58.620> seems<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.099> lot<00:03:59.220> better<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
actually seems a lot better the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.030 
actually seems a lot better the
carbon-fiber<00:04:00.030> body<00:04:00.349> tailboom<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.500> kind<00:04:01.980> of

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
carbon-fiber body tailboom I kind of

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.349 
carbon-fiber body tailboom I kind of
pushed<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.430> it's<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:02.669> lot<00:04:02.790> stronger

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
pushed on it's a lot stronger

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.689 
pushed on it's a lot stronger
it<00:04:03.900> actually<00:04:04.079> has<00:04:04.410> guides<00:04:04.769> for<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.489> tail

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
it actually has guides for the tail

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.619 
it actually has guides for the tail
servo<00:04:07.099> arrays<00:04:08.099> are<00:04:08.280> 250<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.209> here<00:04:09.449> there's

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
servo arrays are 250 down here there's

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.750 
servo arrays are 250 down here there's
no<00:04:09.720> guides<00:04:09.989> for<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.349> tail<00:04:10.590> servo<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.250> this

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
no guides for the tail servo and this

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.569 
no guides for the tail servo and this
this<00:04:12.120> rod<00:04:12.389> here<00:04:13.069> let's<00:04:14.069> see<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.400> get<00:04:14.489> it

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
this rod here let's see if I can get it

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.789 
this rod here let's see if I can get it
this<00:04:14.940> tail<00:04:15.180> servo<00:04:15.480> rod<00:04:15.870> exposed<00:04:16.500> from<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
this tail servo rod exposed from the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.029 
this tail servo rod exposed from the
start<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.519> servo<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.510> very<00:04:19.079> flimsy<00:04:19.590> I'm

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
start of the servo it's very flimsy I'm

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.260 
start of the servo it's very flimsy I'm
barely<00:04:20.400> pushing<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.269> no<00:04:22.169> guides<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.400> very

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
barely pushing on this no guides so very

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.369 
barely pushing on this no guides so very

it's<00:04:32.080> got<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.669> guides<00:04:33.669> its<00:04:34.360> tails<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.470> little

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
it's got the guides its tails a little

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200 
it's got the guides its tails a little
bit<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.919> bigger<00:04:36.099> and<00:04:36.190> stronger<00:04:36.490> it's<00:04:36.879> got<00:04:37.180> a

bit of bigger and stronger it's got a

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.930 
bit of bigger and stronger it's got a
nice<00:04:37.479> setup<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.960> feels<00:04:38.169> smooth<00:04:38.639> but<00:04:39.639> I<00:04:39.669> did

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
nice setup it feels smooth but I did

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.820 
nice setup it feels smooth but I did
have<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.629> know<00:04:40.659> like<00:04:40.990> always<00:04:41.199> there's<00:04:41.680> always

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
some type of problem I encounter the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.480 
some type of problem I encounter the
canopy<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:44.590> came<00:04:44.919> with<00:04:45.129> it<00:04:47.009> see<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.099> canopy

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
canopy that came with it see the canopy

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.879 
canopy that came with it see the canopy
this<00:04:48.759> is<00:04:48.879> how<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.120> came<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.449> me<00:04:49.569> okay<00:04:50.530> it's<00:04:50.710> not

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
this is how it came to me okay it's not

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.189 
this is how it came to me okay it's not
just<00:04:51.129> bent<00:04:51.370> see<00:04:52.000> if<00:04:52.090> we<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.330> get<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:52.599> zoom<00:04:53.020> in

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
just bent see if we can get it zoom in

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.640 
just bent see if we can get it zoom in
here<00:04:53.639> see<00:04:54.639> those<00:04:54.789> lines<00:04:55.090> right<00:04:55.419> there<00:04:55.659> here

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
here see those lines right there here

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.839 
here see those lines right there here
and<00:04:56.860> here<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.940> cracked<00:04:58.330> on<00:04:59.490> both<00:05:00.490> sides

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
and here it's cracked on both sides

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.540 
and here it's cracked on both sides
there's<00:05:01.270> cracks<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.110> bends<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.250> mean<00:05:03.430> this

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
there's cracks and bends so I mean this

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.950 
there's cracks and bends so I mean this
could<00:05:03.789> still<00:05:04.090> work<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.970> could<00:05:07.120> see<00:05:07.360> there<00:05:07.569> see

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
could still work you could see there see

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.270 
could still work you could see there see
how<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:08.229> bending<00:05:08.409> funny<00:05:08.800> that's<00:05:09.069> because

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
how it's bending funny that's because

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.430 
how it's bending funny that's because
it's<00:05:09.430> cracked<00:05:09.729> so<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:10.659> came<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:11.020> me<00:05:11.110> cracked

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
it's cracked so it came to me cracked

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.120 
it's cracked so it came to me cracked
you<00:05:12.069> know<00:05:12.190> not<00:05:12.400> very<00:05:12.430> good<00:05:12.819> quality<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.979> is
