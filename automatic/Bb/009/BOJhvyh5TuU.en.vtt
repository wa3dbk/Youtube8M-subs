of<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:25.340> and<00:00:25.610> it's<00:00:25.820> still<00:00:26.060> extremely<00:00:26.390> easy<00:00:26.840> to

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
of this and it's still extremely easy to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.290

blocks of the door there's two buttons

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.050 
blocks of the door there's two buttons
on<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.329> side<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.290> bottom<00:00:42.680> button<00:00:42.970> opens<00:00:43.970> the

on the side the bottom button opens the
door<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.560> now<00:00:45.560> you<00:00:45.620> can<00:00:45.800> walk<00:00:46.010> straight

door and now you can walk straight
through<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.440> top<00:00:48.650> button<00:00:48.970> closes

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
through it it and the top button closes

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.200 
through it it and the top button closes
the<00:00:50.090> door<00:00:50.270> of<00:00:50.710> course<00:00:51.710> either<00:00:52.220> button<00:00:52.850> works

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the door of course either button works

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.900 
the door of course either button works
from<00:00:53.420> either<00:00:53.630> side<00:00:53.960> these<00:00:54.860> missing<00:00:55.670> blocks

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
from either side these missing blocks

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.410 
from either side these missing blocks
here<00:00:56.270> is<00:00:56.450> just<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.340> it's<00:00:58.340> just<00:00:58.399> lag<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.210> blocks

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
here is just a it's just lag the blocks

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.119 
here is just a it's just lag the blocks
are<00:00:59.570> actually<00:01:00.110> always<00:01:00.440> there<00:01:00.739> as<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.360> see

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
are actually always there as you can see

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.660 
are actually always there as you can see
talk<00:01:04.129> to<00:01:04.159> close<00:01:04.990> bottom<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.140> open<00:01:06.670> really

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
talk to close bottom to open really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.020 
talk to close bottom to open really
really<00:01:07.939> simple<00:01:08.240> really<00:01:08.570> sleek<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:10.700> works

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
really simple really sleek this works

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.320 
really simple really sleek this works
off<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:11.470> idea<00:01:12.470> that<00:01:13.960> um<00:01:15.880> fences<00:01:16.880> stick<00:01:17.180> to

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
off the idea that um fences stick to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.000 
off the idea that um fences stick to
other<00:01:17.510> fences<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:18.229> if<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.380> have<00:01:18.500> another<00:01:18.770> brick

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
other fences so if I have another brick

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.530 
other fences so if I have another brick
fence<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.460> nether<00:01:19.670> brick<00:01:19.850> fence<00:01:20.150> they<00:01:20.299> stick

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
fence and nether brick fence they stick

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.480 
fence and nether brick fence they stick
to<00:01:20.690> each<00:01:20.720> other<00:01:21.020> or<00:01:21.260> if<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.860> have<00:01:21.950> another<00:01:22.190> brick

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
to each other or if I have another brick

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.719 
to each other or if I have another brick
fence<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.690> a<00:01:24.220> solid<00:01:25.220> block<00:01:25.369> it

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
fence and this and a solid block it

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.440 
fence and this and a solid block it
sticks<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.390> however<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.210> also<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.299> same

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
sticks to it however and also the same

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.370 
sticks to it however and also the same
thing<00:01:29.630> works<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:29.960> normal<00:01:30.290> fences<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.010> other

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
thing works with normal fences and other

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100 
thing works with normal fences and other
opaque<00:01:33.380> blocks<00:01:33.740> however<00:01:34.610> normal<00:01:35.360> fences<00:01:35.780> will

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
opaque blocks however normal fences will

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.039 
opaque blocks however normal fences will
not<00:01:36.380> stick<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.950> nether<00:01:37.250> brick<00:01:37.430> fences<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
not stick to nether brick fences and the

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.560 
not stick to nether brick fences and the
space<00:01:39.320> between<00:01:39.880> another<00:01:40.880> brick<00:01:41.119> fence<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.540> a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
space between another brick fence and a

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.120 
space between another brick fence and a
normal<00:01:41.869> fence<00:01:42.110> directly<00:01:42.619> next<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.890> each<00:01:42.979> other

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
normal fence directly next to each other

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.859 
normal fence directly next to each other
is<00:01:43.400> enough<00:01:43.700> for<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:43.970> player<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.210> walk<00:01:44.600> through

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
is enough for a player to walk through

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.649 
is enough for a player to walk through
by<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.740> way<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.610> is<00:01:46.670> not<00:01:47.090> enough<00:01:47.390> for<00:01:47.600> a

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
by the way this is not enough for a

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.690 
by the way this is not enough for a
sheep<00:01:47.990> or<00:01:48.170> Pig<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.770> walk<00:01:48.950> through<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:49.400> you<00:01:49.460> can

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
sheep or Pig to walk through so you can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.340 
sheep or Pig to walk through so you can
make<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:50.950> fence<00:01:51.950> like<00:01:52.549> this<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:54.200> walk

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
make a fence like this and you can walk

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.020 
make a fence like this and you can walk
through<00:01:54.409> but<00:01:54.799> sheep<00:01:55.100> can't<00:01:55.400> walk<00:01:55.610> through<00:01:55.820> but

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
through but sheep can't walk through but

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.870 
through but sheep can't walk through but
that's<00:01:56.210> for<00:01:56.840> another<00:01:56.869> video<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.340> this<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
that's for another video so this is the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.990 
that's for another video so this is the
2<00:01:59.060> by<00:01:59.210> 2<00:01:59.240> version<00:01:59.869> these<00:02:00.460> four<00:02:01.460> blocks<00:02:01.759> here

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
2 by 2 version these four blocks here

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.660 
2 by 2 version these four blocks here
are<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.270> actual<00:02:02.509> door<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.280> when<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> meant<00:02:04.579> you

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
are the actual door and when I meant you

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.490 
are the actual door and when I meant you
can<00:02:04.820> basically<00:02:05.180> strip<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.320> bare

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
can basically strip this to the bare

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.289 
can basically strip this to the bare
minimum<00:02:06.740> these<00:02:07.430> blocks<00:02:07.759> here<00:02:07.970> or<00:02:08.060> not<00:02:08.179> even

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
minimum these blocks here or not even

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.850 
minimum these blocks here or not even
part<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.959> that's<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.530> makes<00:02:09.709> it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
part of it that's just so it makes it

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.510 
part of it that's just so it makes it
into<00:02:10.159> a<00:02:10.189> door<00:02:10.489> and<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.680> is<00:02:12.829> extremely

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
into a door and so this is extremely

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.330 
into a door and so this is extremely
easy<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.910> hide<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.989> one-block<00:02:15.620> thick<00:02:16.040> wall

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
easy to hide in a one-block thick wall

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.150 
easy to hide in a one-block thick wall
and<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.110> 3<00:02:18.380> bed<00:02:18.530> 3<00:02:18.560> version

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
and here is the 3 bed 3 version

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.860 
and here is the 3 bed 3 version
in<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.370> course<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> same<00:02:20.300> as<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> bottom

can walk right through top button will
close<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.620> cannot<00:02:27.890> walk<00:02:28.160> through<00:02:28.400> same

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
close it you cannot walk through same

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.850 
close it you cannot walk through same
works<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> other<00:02:29.840> way<00:02:30.080> bottom<00:02:30.770> button

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
works with the other way bottom button

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.760 
works with the other way bottom button
opens<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.420> walk<00:02:32.600> through<00:02:32.770> top

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
opens it and you can walk through top

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.710 
opens it and you can walk through top
button<00:02:34.130> will<00:02:34.280> close<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.210> cannot<00:02:35.450> walk

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.690 
button will close it and you cannot walk
through<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.890> same<00:02:37.160> way<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.460> you<00:02:37.550> can

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
through and the same way that you can

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.830 
through and the same way that you can
basically<00:02:38.120> strip<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> down<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> alt

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
basically strip this down to the alt

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.480 
basically strip this down to the alt
basically<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.960> only<00:02:42.110> blocks<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.680> need<00:02:42.920> for

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
basically the only blocks you need for

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.970 
basically the only blocks you need for
this<00:02:43.610> actual<00:02:44.060> actually<00:02:44.630> function<00:02:45.080> are<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
this actual actually function are the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.470 
this actual actually function are the
blocks<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.460> door<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.760> made<00:02:46.940> up<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
blocks that the door is made up of and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.970 
blocks that the door is made up of and
the<00:02:47.570> blocks<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.140> buttons<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:48.740> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the blocks with the buttons are on and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190 
the blocks with the buttons are on and
so<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.090> makes<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.810> can<00:02:50.990> basically

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
so that makes it that you can basically

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920 
so that makes it that you can basically
hide<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.890> door<00:02:52.190> anywhere<00:02:52.700> which<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.630> really

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
hide this door anywhere which is really

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.470 
hide this door anywhere which is really
really<00:02:54.140> cool<00:02:54.470> because<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.490> wiring<00:02:56.120> is

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
really cool because all the wiring is

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.350 
really cool because all the wiring is
above<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.020> roof<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.410> below<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.040> floor<00:02:58.400> here

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
above the roof and below the floor here

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.750 
above the roof and below the floor here
is<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.660> four-by-four<00:03:00.080> version<00:03:00.770> this<00:03:01.370> works

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
is the four-by-four version this works

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.390 
is the four-by-four version this works
the<00:03:01.970> same<00:03:02.000> way<00:03:02.240> press<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.350> button<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:04.100> opens

the same way press this button it opens

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.750 
the same way press this button it opens
it<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.210> you<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.450> walk<00:03:05.690> straight<00:03:06.110> through

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
it up and you can walk straight through

press<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> top<00:03:08.090> button<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.900> will<00:03:08.930> close

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
press the top button and it will close

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.190 
press the top button and it will close
and<00:03:09.860> now<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.430> blocked<00:03:10.840> same<00:03:11.840> thing<00:03:12.050> with<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
and now it's blocked same thing with the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.960 
and now it's blocked same thing with the
other<00:03:12.290> side<00:03:12.440> press<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.070> Open<00:03:13.310> button<00:03:13.520> it

the top button it closes and now it's
blocked<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.150> one<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.420> cool<00:03:20.540> thing<00:03:20.780> about

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
blocked and one really cool thing about

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.070 
blocked and one really cool thing about
this<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.550> wiring<00:03:23.030> is<00:03:23.150> extremely

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
this is that the wiring is extremely

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.440 
this is that the wiring is extremely
extremely<00:03:24.530> small<00:03:24.950> here<00:03:25.850> is<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.090> two-by-two

extremely small here is the two-by-two
wiring<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.320> entire<00:03:27.709> thing<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.040> two<00:03:28.310> blocks

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
wiring the entire thing is two blocks

thick and about one or two and two

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.500 
thick and about one or two and two
blocks<00:03:32.300> on<00:03:32.480> either<00:03:32.630> side<00:03:32.930> extra<00:03:33.410> of<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.740> door

same thing with the three by three

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.220 
same thing with the three by three
everything<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.910> two<00:03:38.090> blocks<00:03:38.240> thick<00:03:38.750> except

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
everything is two blocks thick except

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.570 
everything is two blocks thick except
for<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.500> little<00:03:39.560> piece<00:03:40.010> here<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.430> that's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
for this little piece here but that's

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.340 
for this little piece here but that's
just<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.850> get<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.180> wire<00:03:41.630> across<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.230> not

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
just to get the wire across it's not

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.890

blocks thick also extends to two blocks

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.630 
blocks thick also extends to two blocks
of<00:03:47.420> either<00:03:47.660> side<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.230> actual<00:03:48.500> door<00:03:48.800> same

thing with the four by four everything

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.500 
thing with the four by four everything
is<00:03:51.350> two<00:03:51.620> blocks<00:03:51.800> they<00:03:52.220> pretty<00:03:52.459> much<00:03:52.550> except

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
is two blocks they pretty much except

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.970 
is two blocks they pretty much except
for<00:03:53.720> where<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.959> bust<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.380> down<00:03:54.410> there<00:03:54.800> and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
for where you bust it down there and

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.160 
for where you bust it down there and

four<00:04:07.700> by<00:04:07.880> four<00:04:08.150> doors<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.780> mean<00:04:08.989> this<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
four by four doors I mean this the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.150 
four by four doors I mean this the
wiring<00:04:10.100> for<00:04:10.280> this<00:04:10.430> is<00:04:10.610> extremely<00:04:11.360> compact<00:04:12.160> so

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
wiring for this is extremely compact so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.130 
wiring for this is extremely compact so
you<00:04:13.220> can<00:04:13.640> basically<00:04:13.880> fit<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.630> four<00:04:14.989> by<00:04:15.110> four

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
you can basically fit a four by four

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.860 
you can basically fit a four by four
door<00:04:15.650> in<00:04:15.860> a<00:04:15.980> survival<00:04:16.370> world<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.690> need

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
door in a survival world and you need

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.140 
door in a survival world and you need

except actually I think you may have to

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.320 
except actually I think you may have to
use<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.470> repeater<00:04:27.830> or<00:04:28.130> maybe<00:04:28.940> that's<00:04:29.090> for<00:04:29.270> the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
use one repeater or maybe that's for the

use one repeater or maybe that's for the
three<00:04:29.630> by<00:04:29.780> three<00:04:30.080> or<00:04:30.520> actually<00:04:31.520> scratch<00:04:32.090> that

three by three or actually scratch that
you<00:04:32.450> don't<00:04:32.630> need<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.810> use

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
you don't need to use

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.610 
you don't need to use
any<00:04:33.140> repeaters<00:04:33.850> however<00:04:35.110> using<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.350> same

method of scaling up you cannot make a

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
fire by five door and that's not because

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.970 
fire by five door and that's not because
it's<00:04:41.150> too<00:04:41.390> difficult<00:04:41.600> or<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.170> wiring<00:04:42.620> grows

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's too difficult or the wiring grows

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.580 
it's too difficult or the wiring grows
too<00:04:43.670> big<00:04:43.940> that's<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:44.810> because<00:04:44.930> Pistons

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
too big that's just because Pistons

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.350 
too big that's just because Pistons
cannot<00:04:45.980> push<00:04:46.250> more<00:04:46.460> than<00:04:46.610> 12<00:04:46.850> blocks<00:04:47.060> at<00:04:47.300> a

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
cannot push more than 12 blocks at a

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.050 
cannot push more than 12 blocks at a
time<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:47.810> as<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.560> can<00:04:48.710> see<00:04:48.740> here<00:04:49.220> this<00:04:49.640> bottom

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
time and as you can see here this bottom

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.390 
time and as you can see here this bottom
piston<00:04:50.390> needs<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.720> push<00:04:50.900> 1<00:04:51.770> 2<00:04:52.160> 3<00:04:52.430> 4<00:04:53.150> 5<00:04:53.540> 6<00:04:54.020> 7<00:04:54.170> 8<00:04:55.010> 9

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
piston needs to push 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.280 
piston needs to push 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10<00:04:56.090> 11<00:04:56.450> 12<00:04:57.020> blocks<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.850> reset<00:04:59.210> it<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.480> so

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
10 11 12 blocks to reset it and so

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.750 
10 11 12 blocks to reset it and so
that's<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.620> max<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.100> piston<00:05:01.400> can<00:05:01.550> push

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
that's the max that a piston can push

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.150 
that's the max that a piston can push
and<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.270> make<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:03.020> five<00:05:03.500> by<00:05:03.680> five<00:05:03.860> door

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
and so if you make a five by five door

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.380 
and so if you make a five by five door
then<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.490> bottom<00:05:04.640> piston<00:05:05.030> would<00:05:05.180> have<00:05:05.300> to

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
then the bottom piston would have to

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.990 
then the bottom piston would have to
push<00:05:05.570> 15<00:05:06.080> blocks<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.950> open<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.370> or<00:05:07.550> close<00:05:07.790> it

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
push 15 blocks to open it or close it

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.060 
push 15 blocks to open it or close it
and<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:08.960> would<00:05:09.110> be<00:05:09.230> too<00:05:09.500> much<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.920> so<00:05:10.010> it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
and that would be too much and so it

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.350 
and that would be too much and so it
can't<00:05:10.310> push<00:05:10.900> also<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.650> wiring<00:05:13.130> between<00:05:13.360> one

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
can't push also the wiring between one

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.930 
can't push also the wiring between one
to<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.660> other<00:05:14.690> grows<00:05:15.230> linear<00:05:15.800> which<00:05:16.340> means<00:05:16.640> it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
to the other grows linear which means it

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.030 
to the other grows linear which means it
just<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.510> can<00:05:17.990> see<00:05:18.200> here<00:05:18.410> linear<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.920> goes

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
just as you can see here linear it goes

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.190 
just as you can see here linear it goes
straight<00:05:19.400> up<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.870> don't<00:05:20.870> know<00:05:20.960> how<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.110> describe

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
straight up I don't know how to describe

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.380 
straight up I don't know how to describe
it<00:05:21.650> but<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.250> basically<00:05:22.370> means<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.940> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
it but that basically means the the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.840 
it but that basically means the the
distance<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:24.200> difficulty<00:05:25.160> between<00:05:25.340> making

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
really simple to buy 2 door but if you

were to make the 3 by 3 version of this
it<00:05:46.760> would<00:05:46.880> be<00:05:46.940> five<00:05:47.210> times<00:05:47.450> bigger<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:48.140> if<00:05:48.230> you

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
it would be five times bigger and if you

it would be five times bigger and if you
were<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.470> make<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.770> floor<00:05:48.980> by<00:05:49.160> 4<00:05:49.400> version<00:05:49.850> of

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
were to make the floor by 4 version of

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.480 
were to make the floor by 4 version of
this<00:05:50.000> will<00:05:50.150> be<00:05:50.270> like<00:05:50.420> 25<00:05:50.780> times<00:05:51.110> bigger<00:05:51.470> and<00:05:51.740> so

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
this will be like 25 times bigger and so

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.430 
this will be like 25 times bigger and so
a<00:05:52.520> 4<00:05:52.820> by<00:05:52.940> 4<00:05:52.970> door<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.600> that<00:05:53.720> style<00:05:54.110> would<00:05:54.320> be

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
a 4 by 4 door and that style would be

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.950 
a 4 by 4 door and that style would be
huge<00:05:54.920> but<00:05:55.400> four-by-fours<00:05:56.060> door<00:05:56.600> in<00:05:56.750> this

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
huge but four-by-fours door in this

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.050 
huge but four-by-fours door in this
style<00:05:57.140> is<00:05:57.380> really<00:05:57.590> simple<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.280> here's<00:05:59.000> a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
style is really simple and here's a

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.410 
style is really simple and here's a
really<00:05:59.870> quick<00:06:00.410> example<00:06:01.010> of<00:06:01.130> it<00:06:01.730> implemented

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
really quick example of it implemented

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.390 
really quick example of it implemented
in<00:06:02.510> the<00:06:02.570> house<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:03.320> bottom<00:06:03.740> this<00:06:03.890> is<00:06:04.040> a<00:06:04.070> 2<00:06:04.250> by<00:06:04.370> 2

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
in the house the bottom this is a 2 by 2

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.490 
in the house the bottom this is a 2 by 2
version<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.390> bottom<00:06:05.750> of<00:06:05.930> the<00:06:06.080> wiring<00:06:06.410> is

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
version the bottom of the wiring is

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.110 
version the bottom of the wiring is
underground<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:07.130> top<00:06:07.370> can<00:06:07.580> be<00:06:07.610> hidden<00:06:07.850> in

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
underground the top can be hidden in

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.570 
underground the top can be hidden in
second<00:06:08.510> floor<00:06:08.720> but<00:06:09.230> now<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.470> just<00:06:09.650> didn't<00:06:10.370> hide

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
second floor but now I just didn't hide

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.190 
second floor but now I just didn't hide
it<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:10.880> you<00:06:10.940> can<00:06:11.090> see<00:06:11.240> exactly<00:06:11.540> where<00:06:11.720> it<00:06:11.990> lays

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
it so you can see exactly where it lays

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.890 
it so you can see exactly where it lays
and<00:06:12.530> obviously<00:06:13.250> only<00:06:13.760> two<00:06:13.970> blocks<00:06:14.180> sick<00:06:14.630> and

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
and obviously only two blocks sick and

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.200 
and obviously only two blocks sick and
four<00:06:15.170> blocks<00:06:15.470> why<00:06:15.680> pretty<00:06:16.070> a<00:06:16.310> six<00:06:16.790> blocks<00:06:17.000> wide

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
four blocks why pretty a six blocks wide

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.190 
four blocks why pretty a six blocks wide
and<00:06:17.890> bottom<00:06:18.890> will<00:06:19.010> open<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.750> top<00:06:20.750> will<00:06:20.930> close

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
and bottom will open it top will close

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.640 
and bottom will open it top will close
it<00:06:21.410> and<00:06:21.970> you<00:06:22.970> don't<00:06:23.240> see<00:06:23.510> any<00:06:23.720> access<00:06:24.410> what

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
it and you don't see any access what

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.430 
it and you don't see any access what
excess<00:06:25.220> wiring<00:06:25.570> around<00:06:26.570> the<00:06:26.690> entire<00:06:27.020> thing

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
excess wiring around the entire thing

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.380 
excess wiring around the entire thing
it's<00:06:27.710> really<00:06:28.190> really<00:06:28.640> neat<00:06:28.850> it's<00:06:29.060> seamless

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
it's flush and that makes it for a

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.580 
it's flush and that makes it for a
really<00:06:31.730> good<00:06:32.060> door<00:06:32.390> it's<00:06:32.810> also<00:06:32.960> survival

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
really good door it's also survival

I'll<00:07:10.550> make<00:07:11.090> a<00:07:11.120> tutorial<00:07:11.570> for<00:07:11.900> all<00:07:12.230> four<00:07:12.650> of<00:07:12.680> the

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.950 
I'll make a tutorial for all four of the

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.670 
I'll make a tutorial for all four of the
all<00:07:13.160> three<00:07:13.520> of<00:07:13.550> these<00:07:13.760> doors<00:07:14.410> it's<00:07:15.410> really

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
all three of these doors it's really

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.920 
all three of these doors it's really
really<00:07:16.010> simple<00:07:16.040> so<00:07:16.640> pretty<00:07:17.390> much<00:07:17.510> anybody<00:07:17.750> can

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
really simple so pretty much anybody can

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.540 
really simple so pretty much anybody can
do<00:07:18.170> it<00:07:18.200> and<00:07:18.440> you<00:07:18.530> can<00:07:18.650> even<00:07:18.740> memorize<00:07:19.070> how<00:07:19.490> to

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
do it and you can even memorize how to

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.880 
do it and you can even memorize how to
make<00:07:19.730> it<00:07:19.910> because<00:07:20.090> it's<00:07:20.240> so<00:07:20.900> like<00:07:21.410> oh<00:07:21.620> that

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
make it because it's so like oh that

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.170 
make it because it's so like oh that
makes<00:07:22.040> sense<00:07:22.310> it's<00:07:22.730> not<00:07:22.850> really<00:07:23.150> like

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
makes sense it's not really like

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.420 
makes sense it's not really like
thinking<00:07:23.600> why<00:07:24.170> is<00:07:24.230> this<00:07:24.440> repeater<00:07:24.800> here<00:07:24.890> why

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
thinking why is this repeater here why

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.800 
thinking why is this repeater here why
is<00:07:25.460> this<00:07:25.640> torch<00:07:25.910> here<00:07:26.060> and<00:07:26.210> what<00:07:26.300> does<00:07:26.450> that<00:07:26.480> do

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:26.810 
is this torch here and what does that do

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.510 
is this torch here and what does that do
and<00:07:26.990> is<00:07:27.080> there<00:07:27.260> any<00:07:27.530> weird<00:07:27.890> block<00:07:28.130> update

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
and is there any weird block update
