00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
under my eyes and on any blemishes I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.410 
under my eyes and on any blemishes I
would<00:04:40.950> write<00:04:41.130> that<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.580> my<00:04:41.610> finger<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.180> I

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
would write that in with my finger and I

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.850

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.680 
didn't actually do this but if you have
oily<00:04:44.220> skin<00:04:44.250> definitely<00:04:45.150> set<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.540> with<00:04:45.660> a

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
oily skin definitely set it with a

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.260 
oily skin definitely set it with a
powder<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.440> then<00:04:47.070> would<00:04:47.250> add<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> bit<00:04:47.700> of<00:04:47.730> bronzer

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
