00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 extend a kiwi that the club and remember 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.010
 which is rich in antioxidants and about 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 everything has a laxative effect that 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.119
 it's practically going to help you have a 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 better digestion and especially assimilate 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.449
 very good fats that you can consume 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 every day the second ingredient 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.110
 what you need is the nopal here what 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 important is that you choose one for the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.699
 small and this beyond helping you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.440
 have a good digestion especially going 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.449
 to function as a regenerator of your 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.100
 intestinal flora so that this form 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.930
 really begins to assimilate the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.970
 nutrients in a proper way and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 eliminate the toxins that you have others in 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.350
 your body the third ingredient is the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.329
 spinach this obviously is rich in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.280
 iron will give you energy will strengthen your 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.410
 defenses and, above all, will give you the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.390
 energy needed to perform their 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 activities optimally and the fourth 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.619
 The ingredient you need is the lettuce 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.780
 especially remember that sometimes 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.759
 we have too many stressed and that we 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 is going to help put on weight the lettuce 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.840
 what he is going to do is besides having a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.580
 satiating effect begin to reduce 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 levels of anxiety and stress and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.590
 this way make smart decisions 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 in your day to day point number 2 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 how the truth is prepared is that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.679
 prepare this drink that I recommend 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.259
 that you can consume at least three 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.969
 days a week and fasting is 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.859
 extremely simple to do only 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.899
 you need for example a glass of water 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.539
 natural of approximately 250 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.549
 milliliters after some ice juices 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.319
 so that it refreshes very refreshing and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.569
 you are going to start adding the nopal that is 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.450
 previously disinfected apart what in 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:50.549
 slices to make it much easier 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.049
 then you are going to obviously peel your kiwi and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.030
 you're going to split it into pieces you're going to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.209
 pour in the blender and you're going to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.069
 add 5 leaves of spinach and 3 leaves 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.630
 of lettuce and now not only have your 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.610
 blender what we are going to do is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.679
 mix it approximately during a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.420
 minute and a half or two and here the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.869

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
