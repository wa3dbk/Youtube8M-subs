little bit finer tuning for your hi-hat
it<00:01:34.429> also<00:01:34.639> addresses<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.569> few<00:01:35.899> of<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.079> crosstalk

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
it also addresses a few of the crosstalk

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.529 
it also addresses a few of the crosstalk
issues<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.399> if<00:01:37.460> you've<00:01:37.609> had<00:01:37.789> some<00:01:38.030> problems

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
issues so if you've had some problems

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.499 
issues so if you've had some problems
with<00:01:38.659> crosstalk<00:01:39.469> it<00:01:40.399> may<00:01:40.609> solve<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.119> issues

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
with crosstalk it may solve the issues

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.359 
with crosstalk it may solve the issues
you're<00:01:41.689> having<00:01:41.719> let's<00:01:42.469> go<00:01:42.679> ahead<00:01:42.829> and<00:01:43.159> take<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
you're having let's go ahead and take a

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.550 
you're having let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:43.639> at<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.969> module<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.719> get<00:01:44.869> some<00:01:45.079> initial

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
look at the module and get some initial

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.949 
look at the module and get some initial
settings<00:01:46.039> okay<00:01:46.909> we're<00:01:47.119> looking<00:01:47.270> at<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.749> face

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
settings okay we're looking at the face

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.919 
settings okay we're looking at the face
of<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.439> DM<00:01:48.799> 10<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.060> first<00:01:50.299> thing<00:01:50.600> we're<00:01:50.840> gonna

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
of the DM 10 the first thing we're gonna

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.029 
of the DM 10 the first thing we're gonna
look<00:01:51.049> at<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:52.819> protect<00:01:53.450> feature

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
look at is the right protect feature

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.859 
look at is the right protect feature
what<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.759> kind<00:01:55.999> of<00:01:56.030> like<00:01:56.209> a<00:01:56.240> system

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
what this is is kind of like a system

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.879 
what this is is kind of like a system
lock<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:58.060> prevents<00:01:59.060> unwanted<00:01:59.869> changes<00:02:00.619> from

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
lock it prevents unwanted changes from

lock it prevents unwanted changes from
being<00:02:01.159> saved<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.149> module<00:02:03.399> because<00:02:04.399> you're

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
being saved to the module because you're

so<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:32.180> changes<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.169> go<00:04:33.380> through<00:04:33.770> them

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
so that changes as we go through them

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.840 
so that changes as we go through them
now<00:04:35.830> we're<00:04:36.830> going<00:04:36.979> to<00:04:37.039> start<00:04:37.340> off<00:04:37.520> we'll<00:04:37.820> go

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
now we're going to start off we'll go

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.820 
now we're going to start off we'll go
through<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.360> sensitivity<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.350> all<00:04:39.530> of<00:04:39.680> our

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
through the sensitivity of all of our

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.510 
through the sensitivity of all of our
triggers<00:04:40.840> one<00:04:41.840> by<00:04:42.050> one<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.740> look<00:04:43.220> at<00:04:43.370> those

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520

is trigger and you notice the input type

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.520 
is trigger and you notice the input type
says<00:04:59.870> PA<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:00.820> now<00:05:01.820> depending<00:05:02.419> on<00:05:02.840> what<00:05:03.110> type<00:05:03.320> of

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
says PA so now depending on what type of

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.250 
says PA so now depending on what type of
pad<00:05:03.770> you're<00:05:04.160> using<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:05.300> say<00:05:05.510> piezo<00:05:06.199> or
