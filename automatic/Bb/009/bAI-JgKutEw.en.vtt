history

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.060 
history
this<00:05:56.680> is<00:05:56.860> history<00:05:57.220> where<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.550> involves<00:05:57.910> you

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
this is history where it involves you

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.200 
this is history where it involves you
because<00:06:00.070> as<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.520> said<00:06:00.580> this<00:06:00.970> is<00:06:01.180> a

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
because as I said this is a

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.529 
because as I said this is a
transformative<00:06:02.080> process<00:06:02.410> so<00:06:03.039> my<00:06:04.030> question

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
transformative process so my question

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.870 
transformative process so my question
was<00:06:04.810> how<00:06:05.200> is<00:06:05.229> this<00:06:05.590> going<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:05.889> change<00:06:05.950> me<00:06:06.580> and

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
was how is this going to change me and

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.839 
was how is this going to change me and
what<00:06:07.120> am<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.330> going<00:06:07.510> to<00:06:07.599> do<00:06:07.750> about<00:06:07.780> it

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
what am I going to do about it

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.909 
what am I going to do about it
