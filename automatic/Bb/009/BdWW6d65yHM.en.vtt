00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.720 
around the the mouse
but<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.720> thought<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.860> cute<00:02:24.250> idea<00:02:24.370> and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
but I thought what what a cute idea and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.670 
but I thought what what a cute idea and
you<00:02:24.790> really<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.390> do<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> sentiment

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
you really don't have to do a sentiment

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.230 
you really don't have to do a sentiment
on<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> front<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.340> could<00:02:27.550> put<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.060> them

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
on the front you could put one in them

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.630 
on the front you could put one in them
in<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.630> inside<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.770> thought<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
in the inside but I thought a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.710 
in the inside but I thought a
handwritten<00:02:31.620> note<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:33.490> if<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.420> for<00:02:34.600> like

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
handwritten note on if this is for like

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.680 
handwritten note on if this is for like
a<00:02:34.750> baby<00:02:35.050> shower<00:02:35.500> or<00:02:36.240> after<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.360> baby's<00:02:37.660> born

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
a baby shower or after the baby's born

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.180 
a baby shower or after the baby's born
you<00:02:38.320> could<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.770> know<00:02:38.800> write<00:02:39.040> your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
you could just you know write your

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.290 
you could just you know write your
little<00:02:39.610> thing<00:02:42.120> okay

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
little thing okay

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.940 
little thing okay
now<00:02:43.450> comes<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.900> assembly<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:46.050> head<00:02:47.050> so

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
now comes the assembly of the head so

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.470 
now comes the assembly of the head so
you<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.190> these<00:02:48.310> two<00:02:48.370> circles<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.210> you<00:02:49.300> can

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you have these two circles and you can

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.530 
you have these two circles and you can
make<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.630> as<00:02:49.960> wide<00:02:50.200> or<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.580> know<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.270> have<00:02:52.390> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
make it as wide or you know you have to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.700 
make it as wide or you know you have to
be<00:02:52.900> pretty<00:02:53.610> cognizant<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:55.140> how<00:02:56.140> Disney<00:02:56.380> has

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
be pretty cognizant of how Disney has

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.430 
be pretty cognizant of how Disney has
theirs<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.550> think<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.940> did<00:02:58.180> fairly<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:59.380> think

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
theirs and I think I did fairly I think

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.210 
theirs and I think I did fairly I think
you<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.860> identify<00:03:00.040> with<00:03:00.640> who<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:03.130> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
you can identify with who it is so the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.620 
you can identify with who it is so the
first<00:03:03.400> one<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.610> obviously<00:03:03.730> really<00:03:04.120> easy<00:03:04.390> to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
first one is obviously really easy to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.970 
first one is obviously really easy to
put<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.370> only<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.490> one<00:03:06.640> ear<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:08.020> come

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
put on you only have one ear then come

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.200 
put on you only have one ear then come
and<00:03:09.160> just<00:03:09.310> put<00:03:09.490> a<00:03:09.520> little<00:03:09.580> bit<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:11.190> glue<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
and just put a little bit of glue on the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.550 
and just put a little bit of glue on the
edge<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:15.100> then<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.460> second<00:03:16.030> one<00:03:16.240> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
edge and then for the second one that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.260 
edge and then for the second one that
wouldn't<00:03:17.560> look<00:03:17.710> good<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.850> got<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.150> come

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
wouldn't look good so you got to come

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.060 
wouldn't look good so you got to come
over<00:03:20.010> figure<00:03:21.010> out<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.440> matches<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
over figure out if that matches the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:33.510 
over figure out if that matches the
other<00:03:24.130> one

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.600 

and<00:03:33.610> there's<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.390> slight<00:03:35.610> difference

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and there's this slight difference

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.070 
and there's this slight difference
between<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.970> mouse<00:03:37.210> and<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.540> dog<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:38.050> it

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
between a mouse and the dog when it

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.650 
between a mouse and the dog when it
becomes<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.560> dog<00:03:38.910> okay<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:39.970> now<00:03:40.270> you<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.480> this

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
becomes a dog okay so now you have this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.420 
becomes a dog okay so now you have this
together<00:03:40.870> you're<00:03:41.590> gonna<00:03:41.680> take<00:03:42.040> your<00:03:42.160> gelly

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
together you're gonna take your gelly

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.360 
together you're gonna take your gelly
roll<00:03:42.550> pen<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.270> white<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.320> you're<00:03:45.040> going<00:03:45.280> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
roll pen in white and you're going to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.960 
roll pen in white and you're going to
stitch<00:03:46.000> all<00:03:46.570> around<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.990> edge<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.940> when<00:03:51.940> I

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
stitch all around the edge and when I

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.970 
stitch all around the edge and when I
first<00:03:52.300> did<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.990> didn't<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.560> stitching

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
first did this I didn't do the stitching

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.670 
first did this I didn't do the stitching
and<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.250> just<00:03:54.430> looked<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:55.440> something<00:03:56.440> was

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
and it just looked like something was

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.940 
and it just looked like something was
really<00:03:56.830> wrong<00:03:57.180> didn't<00:03:58.180> look<00:03:58.300> good<00:03:58.930> at<00:03:58.990> all<00:03:59.200> so

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
really wrong didn't look good at all so

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.480 
really wrong didn't look good at all so
I<00:03:59.980> highly<00:04:00.430> recommend<00:04:00.460> if<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.660> do<00:04:02.190> plain<00:04:03.190> paper
