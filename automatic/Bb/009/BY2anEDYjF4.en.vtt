00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:12.389
 I don't know what to tell me really three minutes 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.300
 at the appointed time in a difficult challenge what 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.410
 scene 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.410
 everything is decided today 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.110
 now we 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.190
 we do not solve 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.870
 as a team 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.970
 we accept 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.600
 centimeter at a time a pattern after 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.120
 the other 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.870
 until the defeat 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.870
 we are in hell 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.230
 we can stay take the schiana hours 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.230
 open the way to us 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.829
 can climb the walls of the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.829
 an inch to love 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.740
 you know many things with age with time 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.350
 they are removed 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.799
 but this does 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.000
 in life, however, you learn it only when 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.130
 those things start there open 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 life 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.850
 there isn't a bit of a hundred 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 both these games the life to 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.520
 football an error pool at the beginning 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 half step done a little early in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.300
 late and you ca n't make it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.190
 half a second too fast or too much 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.050
 but in centimeters we need them are 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.900
 they are all around us everywhere 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.550
 there are in every break of the game 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.550
 every minute with every second 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.510
 this team fights for a 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.610
 sniper 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.620
 this team but we suffer from making it from 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.690
 ourselves and all those around us 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.940
 for a centimeter 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.820
 we come with nails and teeth for a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.370
 centimeter 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.930
 why we suffer and when will we go to 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.230
 add all those centimeters 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
 then 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.409
 from office 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 marine 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.890
 no 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 so for every room 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.159
 the one who 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.159
 she is willing to die that she will earn today 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.830
 because they are still willing to beat you 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.830
 and to die first cm 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.989
 this so 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.990
 and in those ten centimeters in front of the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.110
 face but I can't pray locals 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
 federico 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 you have next watching 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.770
 wet the ground 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 who will willingly sacrifice for 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 this team 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.330
 that when the time comes
