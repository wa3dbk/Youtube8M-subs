which<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.500> had<00:00:13.620> dashing<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.219> let<00:00:14.370> go

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
which if you just had dashing and let go

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.320 
which if you just had dashing and let go
of<00:00:14.549> control<00:00:14.730> stick<00:00:15.150> you'll<00:00:15.269> stop<00:00:16.880> but<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.090> do

the<00:00:42.690> dash<00:00:43.230> tapper<00:00:43.530> back<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the dash tapper back all I have to do is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
the dash tapper back all I have to do is
just<00:00:45.149> wait<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> split<00:00:45.899> second<00:00:46.320> after<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> dash

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
just wait a split second after you dash

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
just wait a split second after you dash
it's<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.820> quite<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.390> fast<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.230> like

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it's not quite as fast as you know like

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.430 
it's not quite as fast as you know like
canceling<00:00:50.010> you've<00:00:50.219> actually<00:00:50.370> up<00:00:50.700> smash<00:00:50.969> or

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
canceling you've actually up smash or

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
canceling you've actually up smash or
jumping<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.620> whatnot<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.960> quite

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
jumping and whatnot but it is quite

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.889 
jumping and whatnot but it is quite
interesting<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.120> it's<00:00:57.120> actually<00:00:57.360> different

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
interesting and it's actually different

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.529 
interesting and it's actually different
for<00:00:58.079> every<00:00:58.230> character<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.920> extent

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
for every character some extent

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
for every character some extent
characters<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.930> short<00:01:01.320> dash<00:01:01.770> stop

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
characters is very short dash stop

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
characters is very short dash stop
animations<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.449> bowser<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
animations like bowser are able to do

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.020 
animations like bowser are able to do
the<00:01:05.159> force<00:01:05.400> match<00:01:05.640> almost<00:01:05.970> immediately

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
the force match almost immediately

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.060 
the force match almost immediately
ash<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:08.740> at<00:01:08.860> that<00:01:09.690> horse<00:01:10.690> national<00:01:11.500> tilts<00:01:11.950> or

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
ash look at that horse national tilts or

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.859 
ash look at that horse national tilts or
neutral<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.640> combos<00:01:13.030> or<00:01:13.060> whatever<00:01:13.360> wherever

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
neutral a combos or whatever wherever

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.960 
neutral a combos or whatever wherever
you<00:01:14.020> want<00:01:14.229> he's<00:01:14.740> able<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.070> do<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:15.700> almost

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
you want he's able to do like almost

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.920 
you want he's able to do like almost
right<00:01:16.180> at<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.420> back<00:01:16.710> Ron<00:01:17.710> let<00:01:17.979> go<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.640> do<00:01:18.790> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
right at the back Ron let go and do it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.200 
right at the back Ron let go and do it
it's<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:21.009> useful<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.430> some<00:01:21.670> characters

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
it's really useful to some characters

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's really useful to some characters
actually<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:22.900> think<00:01:22.930> most<00:01:23.229> characters<00:01:23.619> could

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
actually I think most characters could

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.960 
actually I think most characters could
make<00:01:24.130> some<00:01:24.640> sort<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.880> use<00:01:25.030> for<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:25.330> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
make some sort of use for this and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.230 
make some sort of use for this and
overall<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:29.170> pretty<00:01:29.259> cool<00:01:29.500> it's<00:01:30.490> not<00:01:30.970> as

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
overall it's pretty cool it's not as

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.850 
overall it's pretty cool it's not as
fast<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.540> melees<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.110> know<00:01:32.259> running<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:32.799> then

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
fast as melees you know running and then

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.850 
fast as melees you know running and then
crouch<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.399> then<00:01:33.549> do<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.899> mismatch<00:01:34.899> but<00:01:35.200> it's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
crouch and then do a mismatch but it's

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.370 
crouch and then do a mismatch but it's
so<00:01:35.979> pretty<00:01:36.159> fast<00:01:36.369> although<00:01:37.270> some<00:01:37.960> who<00:01:38.110> point

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
so pretty fast although some who point

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.930 
so pretty fast although some who point
out<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.920> not<00:01:39.039> quite<00:01:39.340> as<00:01:39.490> fast<00:01:39.640> as<00:01:39.910> you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
out that it's not quite as fast as you

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.460 
out that it's not quite as fast as you
know<00:01:40.149> fox<00:01:40.479> running<00:01:40.750> sir<00:01:41.200> step<00:01:43.050> for<00:01:44.050> smashing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
know fox running sir step for smashing

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.219 
know fox running sir step for smashing
for<00:01:44.619> example<00:01:44.979> but<00:01:45.759> you're<00:01:46.509> only<00:01:46.720> able<00:01:47.050> to

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
for example but you're only able to

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.389 
for example but you're only able to
force<00:01:47.530> match<00:01:47.770> like<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.780> can

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
force match like this so you can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.130 
force match like this so you can
otherwise<00:01:51.399> you<00:01:51.940> have<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.300> run<00:01:52.509> stock<00:01:52.840> down

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
otherwise you have to run stock down

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.639 
otherwise you have to run stock down
smash<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.950> know<00:01:54.069> if<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:55.630> till<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:56.289> a

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
smash you know if you down till it's a

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.340 
smash you know if you down till it's a
lot<00:01:57.460> more<00:01:57.490> easeful<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.030> also<00:01:58.330> keep<00:01:59.200> in<00:01:59.289> mind

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
lot more easeful and also keep in mind

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.919 
lot more easeful and also keep in mind
that<00:01:59.649> you<00:01:59.830> can't<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.520> tap<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.270> dash<00:02:01.720> like

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
that you can't just tap the dash like

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.710 
that you can't just tap the dash like
that<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.380> do<00:02:02.920> dash<00:02:03.159> stopping<00:02:03.610> in<00:02:03.670> mission<00:02:04.030> you

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
that and do dash stopping in mission you

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.779 
that and do dash stopping in mission you
have<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.990> tap<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.679> in<00:02:05.800> holder<00:02:06.340> per<00:02:06.490> second

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
have to tap it in holder per second
