so<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.650> theme<00:01:05.830> for<00:01:06.040> our<00:01:06.070> conference<00:01:06.310> this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
so the theme for our conference this

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.670 
so the theme for our conference this
year<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.910> kaleidoscope<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:08.230> is<00:01:08.350> an<00:01:08.470> idea

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
year is kaleidoscope this is an idea

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.020 
year is kaleidoscope this is an idea
that<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.920> came<00:01:09.070> up<00:01:09.130> with<00:01:09.460> during<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> bidding

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
that we came up with during the bidding

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.090 
that we came up with during the bidding
process<00:01:10.210> we<00:01:11.140> really<00:01:11.380> wanted<00:01:11.620> something<00:01:12.070> that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
process we really wanted something that

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.730 
process we really wanted something that
would<00:01:12.610> encompass<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.900> diversity<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
would encompass the diversity of the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.740 
would encompass the diversity of the
taiwanese<00:01:15.250> american<00:01:15.280> community<00:01:16.210> my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
taiwanese american community my

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.720 
taiwanese american community my
reasoning<00:01:17.140> was<00:01:17.260> that<00:01:17.290> people<00:01:18.250> tend<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.520> think

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
reasoning was that people tend to think

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.880 
reasoning was that people tend to think
of<00:01:18.820> us<00:01:18.940> as<00:01:19.120> a<00:01:19.180> homogenous<00:01:19.870> group<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.380> mean<00:01:20.710> it's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
of us as a homogenous group I mean it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.530 
of us as a homogenous group I mean it's
pretty<00:01:21.040> specific<00:01:21.310> when<00:01:22.150> you're<00:01:22.270> talking

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
pretty specific when you're talking

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.810 
pretty specific when you're talking
about<00:01:22.660> Taiwanese<00:01:23.170> Americans<00:01:23.770> but<00:01:24.400> even

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
about Taiwanese Americans but even

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.700 
about Taiwanese Americans but even
within<00:01:25.000> that<00:01:25.270> small<00:01:25.480> community<00:01:26.080> there's<00:01:26.500> so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
within that small community there's so

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.170 
within that small community there's so
much<00:01:26.830> diversity<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.730> terms<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:28.030> our

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
much diversity in terms of our

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.110 
much diversity in terms of our
background<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.200> our<00:01:29.620> interests<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.400> where

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
background and our interests and where

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.150 
background and our interests and where
we're<00:01:31.240> going<00:01:31.420> in<00:01:31.660> life<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.650> thought

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
we're going in life that I thought

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.730 
we're going in life that I thought
kaleidoscope<00:01:33.700> would<00:01:33.910> be<00:01:34.710> representative<00:01:35.710> of

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
kaleidoscope would be representative of

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.250 
kaleidoscope would be representative of
how<00:01:36.700> different<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.180> are<00:01:37.210> but<00:01:37.930> at<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.050> same

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
how different we are but at the same

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.380 
how different we are but at the same
time<00:01:38.550> when<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.640> different<00:01:39.910> pieces<00:01:40.030> come

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
time when the different pieces come

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.270 
time when the different pieces come
together<00:01:40.570> they<00:01:40.990> form<00:01:41.350> some<00:01:41.800> sort<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:42.100> pattern

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
together they form some sort of pattern

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.700 
together they form some sort of pattern
some<00:01:42.730> sort<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:42.940> cohesive<00:01:43.450> body<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:44.110> together

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
some sort of cohesive body and together

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.980 
some sort of cohesive body and together
we're<00:01:45.100> able<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.460> accomplish<00:01:45.730> much<00:01:46.210> more<00:01:46.720> than
