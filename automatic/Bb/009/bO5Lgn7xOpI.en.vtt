hope he'll do the rest because it's

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.190 
hope he'll do the rest because it's
easier<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.090> replace<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.450> gas<00:04:21.630> tank<00:04:21.930> without

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
the bed in the way so he's coming on a

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.780 
the bed in the way so he's coming on a
flatbed<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.960> get<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.200> anyway<00:04:25.500> so<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:26.730> doesn't

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
flatbed to get it anyway so it doesn't

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.560 
flatbed to get it anyway so it doesn't
really<00:04:27.060> matter<00:04:27.920> anyway<00:04:28.920> so<00:04:29.520> now<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.420> looks
