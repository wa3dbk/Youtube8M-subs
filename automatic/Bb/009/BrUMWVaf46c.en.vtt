00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello how are you? I am payment and the day of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.399
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to learn 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.490
 inspired by the eye makeup of 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:13.420
 fraud have the same to step back and from 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.520
 I'm going to start with my naked there and go 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.980
 to leave teachers that I'm using in 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.380
 the description and I'm going to apply a primer 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.240
 for shadows especially my eyelid and what 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.980
 I'm going to bring up the part of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.529
 above my eyebrow and I'm going to apply this 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.259
 color as page with brightness if what 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.900
 practice mostly my eyelid and about 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.270
 the bone of my eyebrow because I really do not 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 it looks or a very noticeable shadow there but 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.400
 so let's put something as a base and that 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.500
 is I'm going to apply this coffee color that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.040
 I always use and a pinch of this coffee 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.770
 strong and I will go to how it is said to 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.590
 define this part of here from my eye 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.750
 in some pictures you can see how its gray 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.260
 was defined a little above what 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.720
 normal i am ama 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.880
 very good 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.150
 while I blew them away I'm going to take it 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.840
 little down to create that as 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.460
 this is once the dark brown color and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.100
 I'm going to apply it below my 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.450
 tabs and I'm going to create another list that's going 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.320
 to be like a little stick now you do not have 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.430
 here 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.380
 in prison 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.470
 then I'm going to take a black color and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.510
 I'm wearing this black matte that's like 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.210
 very and I'm going to apply it in the corner of 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.040
 my eye defining a little more the corner 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.170
 better I do not know the truth I've seen a lot 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.020
 in the photos that you have already defined 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.610
 is that in this corner I just said hang on 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.610
 you and they stay 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.680
 and after all one more brush 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.479
 delgadita and in the same I looked and I go to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.430
 delineate the bottom part of my 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.369
 tabs with her you could use a 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.310
 eyeliner and then blur the rest 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.440
 eyeliner on your eyelashes like you 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.510
 I'm not like eyeliner pencil 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.890
 because they already know and with the help of that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.660
 artist I will also define a little 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.280
 more the corner and how this corner does not 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.890
 I finished in tip in the others I'm going to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 delete yep and after this comes the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 most important and most difficult part of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 all this new that is the delineated and 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.989
 As you can see my eyes are round and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.459
 I can see in the photos that the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.320
 eyeliner does not start 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.550
 exactly in the corner of your eyes and 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.590
 He understood, I'm not going to do that either 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.780
 then as you can see I started a little 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.180
 higher than my normal eye and I'm 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.249
 creating this his forgiveness 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.159
 Geez and the joke of this look is 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:49.099
 do it as super in an angle as well 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.620
 that both and although it really does not look 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.150
 nothing because they do not love those shots in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.489
 who forgot that I'm recording and saved 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.000
 decades of pictures in do not you love 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.000
 that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.970
 ah 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.260
 I took a liquid eyeliner to be able 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.540
 make this line much more defined and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.500
 cleaner in what I can 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.450
 do it and already then I intend to 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.950
 this what is how to define a lot in the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 corner of your eye in this part here 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.560
 so that it looks a little more at an angle and 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.000
 no and you already know the angled eyeliner 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 the people who have the eyes 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.460
 round you will know that you make them act 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:44.180
 goes here that is 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:47.330
 is not irritating too much for 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.120
 illuminate all this I will use one eye 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.700
 one of these is a white shadow and I'm going 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.320
 to show my eyelashes and I'm going to put 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.570
 screamer and just when he has to go 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.800
 fast all these shots are not going 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.050
 fast how soon and I'm going to apply too 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.210
 in the eyelashes and like when I was 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.040
 doing a makeup like that styles no longer 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.230
 you can walk with your normal eyelashes 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.690
 for the life we are going to apply the lashes 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.230
 longer you find in the store 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.580
 closest when nothing else action 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.170
 I figured it would have to be like that 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.620
 because I think they are plants and apply the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.840
 glue and glue them to your eye to your 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.270
 eyelashes of a leaf and one of you or 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.850
 because really and also forget this 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.220
 part that was recording and my eyes or 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.760
 my face were somewhere in this 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.710
 universe then look flawless already 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.810
 so if our brands are left 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.360
 glue nothing more with eyeliner on top 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.889
 and disappear or that really all this 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.240
 not disappear with time 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.190
 we are senior 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.139
