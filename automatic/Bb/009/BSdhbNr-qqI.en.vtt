you had anything so a doormat these are
just<00:01:19.229> blank<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.040> sit<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> they

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
just blank they just sit there and they

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
just blank they just sit there and they
do<00:01:20.729> nothing<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:22.080> we're<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.009> about

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
do nothing but we're here to think about

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.740 
do nothing but we're here to think about
hypothetical<00:01:23.970> situations<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:26.360> say<00:01:27.360> if

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
hypothetical situations here now say if

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.780 
hypothetical situations here now say if
these<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.970> enemies<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.000> example<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> think

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
these are enemies for example so think

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
these are enemies for example so think
about<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.150> different<00:01:33.479> things<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> enemies

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
about the different things the enemies

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.010 
about the different things the enemies
have<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.920> games<00:01:35.310> well<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.630> might<00:01:36.780> have

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
have in games well they might have

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590 
have in games well they might have
different<00:01:37.290> amounts<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.650> health<00:01:38.240> some<00:01:39.240> enemies

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
different amounts of health some enemies

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
different amounts of health some enemies
take<00:01:39.869> more<00:01:40.079> hits<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> kill<00:01:40.970> some<00:01:41.970> enemies<00:01:42.360> are

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
take more hits to kill some enemies are

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
take more hits to kill some enemies are
stronger<00:01:42.990> than<00:01:43.079> others<00:01:43.200> they've<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.399> all

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stronger than others they've got all

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
stronger than others they've got all
sorts<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.970> different<00:01:45.030> types<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> things

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
sorts of different types of things

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
sorts of different types of things
different<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> them<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:46.740> might<00:01:46.829> move<00:01:47.070> in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
different to them they might move in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.230 
different to them they might move in
different<00:01:47.610> fashions<00:01:48.560> now<00:01:49.560> let's<00:01:50.040> say<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:51.030> if

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
different fashions now let's say that if

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
different fashions now let's say that if
the<00:01:51.450> blue<00:01:51.720> touches<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> green<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.280> green

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the blue touches the green the green

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.389 
the blue touches the green the green
loses<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.630> HP<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.619> main<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
loses one HP now the main thing that I

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.230 
loses one HP now the main thing that I
want<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.299> make<00:01:57.810> clear<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.490> these

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
want to make clear here is that these

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.359 
want to make clear here is that these
two<00:02:01.079> green<00:02:01.890> squares<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:03.000> both<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.259> same

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
two green squares here are both the same

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.789 
two green squares here are both the same
object<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.479> are<00:02:06.570> different<00:02:07.020> instances

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
object but there are different instances

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.369 
object but there are different instances
I'll<00:02:08.670> explain<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.209> mean<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
I'll explain what I mean they are the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.750 
I'll explain what I mean they are the
same<00:02:10.560> objects<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> look<00:02:11.580> into

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
same objects because if you look into

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.970 
same objects because if you look into
your<00:02:11.910> objects<00:02:12.480> list

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
your objects list

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.030 
your objects list
and<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.340> click<00:02:13.879> on<00:02:13.909> obj<00:02:14.840> green<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.440> they'll

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and you click on obj green here they'll

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.580 
and you click on obj green here they'll
have<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.489> same<00:02:16.700> chord<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.659> can<00:02:17.810> add<00:02:17.959> event<00:02:18.290> at

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
have the same chord you can add event at

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.470 
have the same chord you can add event at
different<00:02:18.920> events<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.549> different<00:02:20.239> piece<00:02:20.360> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
different events a different piece of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.479 
different events a different piece of
court<00:02:20.750> pieces<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.319> cord<00:02:21.560> make<00:02:22.129> them<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.459> all

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
court pieces of cord make them do all

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.490 
court pieces of cord make them do all
sorts<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.090> weird<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.599> wonderful<00:02:23.720> things<00:02:24.230> but

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
sorts of weird and wonderful things but

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.580 
sorts of weird and wonderful things but
they<00:02:25.040> are<00:02:25.159> both<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:26.269> same<00:02:26.299> they<00:02:27.230> are<00:02:27.349> both

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
they are both the same they are both

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.979 
they are both the same they are both
running<00:02:28.519> off<00:02:28.760> exactly<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.360> same<00:02:29.569> piece<00:02:29.810> of

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
running off exactly the same piece of

running off exactly the same piece of
code<00:02:30.700> but<00:02:31.700> they<00:02:31.849> are<00:02:31.940> both<00:02:32.120> instance<00:02:32.720> is

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
code but they are both instance is

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.050 
code but they are both instance is
different<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.950> one<00:02:34.069> another<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.730> what<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:34.970> mean

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
different to one another and what I mean

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.509 
different to one another and what I mean
by<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.690> I've<00:02:36.200> said<00:02:36.650> before<00:02:36.680> if<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.340> blue

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
by that is I've said before if the blue

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.699 
by that is I've said before if the blue
touches<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.030> green<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:39.140> again<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.680> a

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
touches the green and again this is a

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.770 
touches the green and again this is a
hypothetical<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.670> hasn't<00:02:40.970> been<00:02:41.030> programmed

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
hypothetical this hasn't been programmed

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.210 
hypothetical this hasn't been programmed
in<00:02:41.930> or<00:02:42.079> anything<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.560> haven't<00:02:42.709> doing<00:02:43.010> anything

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
in or anything I haven't doing anything

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.449 
in or anything I haven't doing anything
at<00:02:43.549> this<00:02:43.670> point<00:02:43.760> I'm<00:02:44.510> just<00:02:44.810> explaining<00:02:45.200> if<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
at this point I'm just explaining if you

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.710 
at this point I'm just explaining if you
wanted<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> make<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.569> blue

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
wanted to make it so that if the blue

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.960 
wanted to make it so that if the blue
touches<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.260> green<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:49.069> the<00:02:49.340> green<00:02:49.489> loses

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
touches the green then the green loses

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.400 
touches the green then the green loses
one<00:02:50.150> health<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.750> he<00:02:51.319> touches<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:52.120> instance

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
one health if he touches this instance

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.110 
one health if he touches this instance
this<00:02:54.410> green<00:02:54.739> one<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.459> green<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:55.940> will

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
this green one then this green one will

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.849 
this green one then this green one will
lose<00:02:56.299> health<00:02:56.540> even<00:02:57.319> though<00:02:57.440> they're<00:02:57.590> both<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
lose health even though they're both the

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.289 
lose health even though they're both the
same<00:02:57.890> object<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.700> run<00:02:58.849> off<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.090> same

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
same object and the run off the same

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.050 
same object and the run off the same
code<00:02:59.660> they<00:03:00.410> are<00:03:00.530> still<00:03:00.739> both<00:03:01.010> individuals<00:03:01.790> if

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
code they are still both individuals if

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.869 
code they are still both individuals if
the<00:03:02.629> blue<00:03:02.810> touches<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.440> green<00:03:03.709> one<00:03:03.950> this

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
the blue touches this green one this

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.059 
the blue touches this green one this
green<00:03:05.180> one<00:03:05.390> will<00:03:05.599> lose<00:03:05.750> health<00:03:05.989> but<00:03:06.769> this

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
green one will lose health but this

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.910 
green one will lose health but this
green<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.549> wants<00:03:07.970> because<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:08.920> regarding

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
green one wants because it's regarding

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.130 
green one wants because it's regarding
the<00:03:10.599> instances<00:03:11.599> not<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.650> objects<00:03:13.129> themselves

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
the instances not the objects themselves

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.630 
the instances not the objects themselves
the<00:03:15.140> best<00:03:15.379> way<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.560> think<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
the best way to think of this is to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.289 
the best way to think of this is to
think<00:03:16.910> about<00:03:17.859> well<00:03:18.859> any<00:03:19.220> enemy<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.910> any<00:03:20.060> game

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
think about well any enemy in any game

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.990 
think about well any enemy in any game
really<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.440> think<00:03:22.280> about<00:03:22.519> something<00:03:22.880> as

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
really that think about something as

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.870 
really that think about something as
basic<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.450> basic<00:03:24.049> as<00:03:24.169> space<00:03:24.470> invaders<00:03:25.040> you

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
basic as basic as space invaders you

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.030 
basic as basic as space invaders you
have<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.180> aliens<00:03:26.599> that<00:03:26.810> they<00:03:26.870> all<00:03:27.440> have<00:03:27.859> the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
have the aliens that they all have the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.569 
have the aliens that they all have the
same<00:03:28.220> pattern<00:03:28.700> they<00:03:29.269> all<00:03:29.739> move<00:03:30.739> left<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> right

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
same pattern they all move left to right

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.220 
same pattern they all move left to right
it<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:31.880> when<00:03:32.120> they<00:03:32.299> move<00:03:32.599> so<00:03:32.840> many<00:03:32.989> spaces

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
it and when they move so many spaces

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.770 
it and when they move so many spaces
they<00:03:33.470> move<00:03:33.620> down<00:03:33.889> and<00:03:34.220> they<00:03:34.280> all<00:03:34.430> move<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:35.660> the

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
they move down and they all move to the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.020 
they move down and they all move to the
left<00:03:35.989> bit<00:03:36.410> by<00:03:36.590> base<00:03:36.859> they<00:03:37.430> all<00:03:37.549> shoot<00:03:37.849> bullets

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
left bit by base they all shoot bullets

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.900 
left bit by base they all shoot bullets
out<00:03:38.359> every<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.900> often<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:40.099> vault<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.730> roll

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
out every so often the vault the roll

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.729 
out every so often the vault the roll
running<00:03:41.750> off<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.930> same<00:03:42.230> bit<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.530> information

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
running off the same bit of information

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.099 
running off the same bit of information
they've<00:03:43.220> all<00:03:43.340> given<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.760> same<00:03:43.910> commands<00:03:44.359> but

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
they've all given the same commands but

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.900 
they've all given the same commands but
if<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.230> kill<00:03:45.440> one<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.680> them<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.400> only<00:03:46.430> killing

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
if you kill one of them you only killing

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.839 
if you kill one of them you only killing
that<00:03:47.690> particular<00:03:48.349> one<00:03:48.919> that<00:03:49.160> particular

that particular one that particular

that particular one that particular
instance<00:03:50.620> so<00:03:51.620> that's<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.370> an<00:03:52.579> important<00:03:53.209> not

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480

instance so that's just an important not
to<00:03:53.510> make<00:03:54.079> the<00:03:54.410> difference<00:03:54.680> between<00:03:54.980> an
