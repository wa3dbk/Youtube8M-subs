today we're going to talk about and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.230 
today we're going to talk about and
demonstrate<00:00:26.890> solar-powered<00:00:27.890> ice<00:00:28.340> yes<00:00:28.939> you

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
demonstrate solar-powered ice yes you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.139 
demonstrate solar-powered ice yes you
can<00:00:29.390> actually<00:00:29.599> have<00:00:30.579> solar-powered<00:00:31.579> ice<00:00:31.820> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
can actually have solar-powered ice and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.770 
can actually have solar-powered ice and
it's<00:00:32.570> a<00:00:32.630> very<00:00:32.809> simple<00:00:33.140> thing<00:00:33.260> all<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.890> need<00:00:34.190> is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
it's a very simple thing all you need is

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.410 
it's a very simple thing all you need is
one<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:36.079> solar<00:00:36.530> panel<00:00:36.800> maybe<00:00:37.370> at<00:00:37.640> least<00:00:37.790> 120

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420

one a solar panel maybe at least 120
watts<00:00:38.600> like<00:00:38.840> I<00:00:38.989> have<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.579> regulator<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:41.390> good

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
watts like I have a regulator and a good

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.380 
watts like I have a regulator and a good
inverter<00:00:42.309> because<00:00:43.309> there's<00:00:43.460> about<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.670> 750

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390

my salt and ice machine that I've been

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.250 
my salt and ice machine that I've been
using<00:00:56.990> here<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:01.220> we<00:01:01.520> got<00:01:01.700> a<00:01:02.030> full<00:01:02.630> hopper<00:01:03.110> of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
using here and we got a full hopper of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.469 
using here and we got a full hopper of
ice<00:01:03.470> that<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.519> cranked<00:01:04.939> out<00:01:05.030> in<00:01:05.180> about<00:01:05.269> the

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
ice that we cranked out in about the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.170 
ice that we cranked out in about the
last<00:01:05.659> hour<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.140> half<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.850> it's<00:01:07.850> all

last hour and a half and it's all
compliments<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.290> Sun<00:01:09.590> right<00:01:09.829> now<00:01:10.009> because

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
compliments of the Sun right now because

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.050 
compliments of the Sun right now because
we<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:11.450> no<00:01:11.689> grid<00:01:12.110> power<00:01:12.350> at<00:01:12.590> all<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.060> there's

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
we have no grid power at all and there's

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.080 
we have no grid power at all and there's
no<00:01:14.119> cell<00:01:14.420> phone<00:01:14.630> service<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.229> a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
no cell phone service this is a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.030 
no cell phone service this is a
provincial<00:01:17.090> park<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:17.869> there<00:01:18.200> are<00:01:18.380> no<00:01:18.560> services

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
provincial park so there are no services

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.219 
provincial park so there are no services
here<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.429> we're<00:01:20.060> running<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.539> all<00:01:20.719> through<00:01:21.049> my

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
here and we're running it all through my

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.399 
here and we're running it all through my
3000<00:01:22.069> watt<00:01:22.219> inverter<00:01:22.399> right<00:01:22.729> here<00:01:23.389> which<00:01:24.200> you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
3000 watt inverter right here which you

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.230 
3000 watt inverter right here which you
can<00:01:24.560> hear<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.859> hum<00:01:25.069> of<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.280> motor<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:28.240> the

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
can hear the hum of the motor and the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.120 
can hear the hum of the motor and the
best<00:01:29.479> part<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:30.409> should<00:01:30.590> make<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.950> ice

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
best part is you should make the ice

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.410 
best part is you should make the ice
during<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> hottest<00:01:31.880> part<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.359> day

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
during the hottest part of the day

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
during the hottest part of the day
because<00:01:32.689> your<00:01:33.020> panel<00:01:33.469> is<00:01:33.560> throwing<00:01:33.920> off<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
because your panel is throwing off the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.359 
because your panel is throwing off the
most<00:01:34.459> amount<00:01:34.759> of<00:01:34.999> electricity<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:37.249> ice

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
most amount of electricity and the ice

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.919 
most amount of electricity and the ice
will<00:01:37.549> keep<00:01:37.759> when<00:01:37.939> things<00:01:38.149> cool<00:01:38.359> down<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.659> little

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
will keep when things cool down a little

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.309 
will keep when things cool down a little
bit<00:01:39.109> later<00:01:39.319> so<00:01:40.240> it's<00:01:41.240> working<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:41.840> fine<00:01:42.020> um

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
bit later so it's working just fine um

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.949 
bit later so it's working just fine um
and<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.340> modified<00:01:43.850> sine<00:01:44.179> inverter<00:01:44.659> so

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
and this is a modified sine inverter so

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.289 
and this is a modified sine inverter so
I<00:01:45.229> have<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.979> sneaking<00:01:46.310> suspicion<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.939> most

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
I have a sneaking suspicion that most

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.120 
I have a sneaking suspicion that most
ice<00:01:47.539> machines<00:01:48.049> will<00:01:48.289> actually<00:01:48.649> work<00:01:48.799> quite

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
ice machines will actually work quite

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.800 
ice machines will actually work quite
fine<00:01:49.399> on<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> modified<00:01:50.060> sine<00:01:50.569> wave<00:01:50.779> inverter

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
fine on a modified sine wave inverter

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.929 
fine on a modified sine wave inverter
because<00:01:51.499> I've<00:01:51.950> had<00:01:52.130> good<00:01:52.279> results<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.850> a

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
because I've had good results and a

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.239 
because I've had good results and a
strange<00:01:53.240> thing<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:54.170> techies<00:01:54.649> out<00:01:54.829> here<00:01:55.039> who

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
strange thing you techies out here who

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.769 
strange thing you techies out here who
know<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.429> lot<00:01:55.639> more<00:01:55.789> about<00:01:55.850> electricity<00:01:56.359> than<00:01:56.689> I

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
know a lot more about electricity than I

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:59.679 
know a lot more about electricity than I
do<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:57.170> want<00:01:57.889> you<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.039> tell<00:01:58.249> me<00:01:58.399> why<00:01:58.639> the<00:01:59.479> ice

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
do I want you to tell me why the ice

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.330 
do I want you to tell me why the ice
cubes<00:02:00.259> which<00:02:00.560> I'm<00:02:00.679> going<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.859> grab<00:02:01.009> one<00:02:01.219> right

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
cubes which I'm going to grab one right

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.029 
cubes which I'm going to grab one right
now<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:05.270> ice<00:02:05.509> cubes<00:02:06.109> are<00:02:06.469> bigger<00:02:08.560> off<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.860> my

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
now the ice cubes are bigger off of my

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920 
now the ice cubes are bigger off of my
inverter<00:02:10.490> running<00:02:11.030> from<00:02:11.180> my<00:02:11.300> solar<00:02:11.540> panel

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
inverter running from my solar panel

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.020 
inverter running from my solar panel
then<00:02:12.500> when<00:02:12.709> I'm<00:02:12.830> plugged<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.550> don't<00:02:13.910> know

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
then when I'm plugged in I don't know

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.300 
then when I'm plugged in I don't know
why<00:02:14.209> take<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.990> look<00:02:15.230> at<00:02:15.319> these<00:02:15.470> are<00:02:15.650> good<00:02:16.099> sized

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
why take a look at these are good sized

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.480 
why take a look at these are good sized
cubes<00:02:16.970> right<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:17.599> um<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.280> for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
cubes right here um and I know this for

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.089 
cubes right here um and I know this for
a<00:02:19.550> fact<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:19.970> last<00:02:20.420> night<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.959> was<00:02:21.770> plugged

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
a fact because last night I was plugged

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.869 
a fact because last night I was plugged
in<00:02:22.400> about<00:02:22.910> 50<00:02:23.599> miles<00:02:23.750> from<00:02:23.989> here<00:02:24.349> at<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.590> RV<00:02:25.459> park

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
in about 50 miles from here at a RV park

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.300 
in about 50 miles from here at a RV park
and<00:02:26.090> ice<00:02:26.989> cubes<00:02:27.379> were<00:02:27.560> smaller<00:02:27.860> same<00:02:28.159> with

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
and ice cubes were smaller same with

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.970 
and ice cubes were smaller same with
when<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.489> use<00:02:28.670> that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
when I use that

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.699 
when I use that
machine<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.430> home<00:02:29.610> they're<00:02:30.269> smaller<00:02:30.659> now<00:02:31.530> that

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
machine at home they're smaller now that

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.050 
machine at home they're smaller now that
probably<00:02:31.890> means<00:02:32.069> there's<00:02:32.310> more<00:02:32.370> air<00:02:32.730> locked

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
probably means there's more air locked

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.979 
probably means there's more air locked
in<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.420> ice<00:02:33.659> cubes<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:34.230> they<00:02:34.650> are<00:02:34.830> bigger<00:02:35.069> so

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
in the ice cubes but they are bigger so

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.930 
in the ice cubes but they are bigger so
anybody<00:02:36.989> know<00:02:37.349> why<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:37.860> happening<00:02:38.340> please
