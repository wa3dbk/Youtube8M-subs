00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
centuries from Calista as well so this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.100 
centuries from Calista as well so this
is<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> strong<00:02:12.989> side<00:02:13.200> for<00:02:13.379> co<00:02:13.500> gian

system<00:02:17.880> definitely<00:02:18.880> backfires<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:19.780> this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
system definitely backfires on then this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.630 
system definitely backfires on then this
is<00:02:20.110> why<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.290> drop<00:02:20.590> pink<00:02:20.860> wards<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.340> your

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
is why you drop pink wards in your

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.970 
is why you drop pink wards in your
strong<00:02:21.880> side<00:02:22.180> because<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.350> defend<00:02:23.770> them

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
strong side because you can defend them

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.250

is<00:03:58.870> be<00:03:59.470> like<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.709> said<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.980> leads<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.459> think

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
is be like you said the leads I think

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.340 
is be like you said the leads I think
they're<00:04:01.269> taking<00:04:01.390> fights<00:04:01.750> sometimes<00:04:01.989> when

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
they're taking fights sometimes when

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.860 
they're taking fights sometimes when
they<00:04:02.470> don't<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.860> as<00:04:03.040> big<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.850> lead<00:04:04.090> as<00:04:04.299> they

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
they don't have as big of a lead as they

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.539 
they don't have as big of a lead as they
think<00:04:04.930> they<00:04:05.320> do<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:06.010> they're<00:04:06.130> ahead<00:04:06.250> like

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
think they do I think they're ahead like

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.550 
think they do I think they're ahead like
3-4<00:04:07.209> k<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.630> they're<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:07.959> we<00:04:08.170> can<00:04:08.290> take<00:04:08.440> this

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
3-4 k and they're like we can take this

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.229 
3-4 k and they're like we can take this
fight<00:04:08.769> when<00:04:09.040> they<00:04:09.160> feel<00:04:09.370> like<00:04:09.430> they're<00:04:09.730> 7k

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
fight when they feel like they're 7k

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.729 
fight when they feel like they're 7k
ahead<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.720> think<00:04:11.230> that's<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.470> big<00:04:11.590> thing<00:04:11.620> is

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
ahead I think that's the big thing is

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.259 
ahead I think that's the big thing is
they<00:04:11.920> need<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.190> assess<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.610> power<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.150> their

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
they need to assess the power of their

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.600 
they need to assess the power of their
enemy<00:04:13.600> just<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.110> little<00:04:14.380> bit<00:04:14.560> better<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.010> then

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
enemy just a little bit better and then

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.219 
enemy just a little bit better and then
assess<00:04:15.910> their<00:04:16.209> power<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:16.989> conjunction

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
assess their power and in conjunction

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.569 
assess their power and in conjunction
because<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.709> was<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.829> great<00:04:17.979> fight<00:04:18.310> down

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
because that was a great fight down

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.759 
because that was a great fight down
bottom<00:04:18.970> where<00:04:19.269> avalon<00:04:19.630> was<00:04:19.750> still<00:04:20.019> five<00:04:20.320> he

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
bottom where avalon was still five he

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.500 
bottom where avalon was still five he
ran<00:04:20.950> in<00:04:21.100> he's<00:04:21.250> like<00:04:21.370> i'ma<00:04:21.519> kill<00:04:21.850> oh<00:04:21.880> wait<00:04:22.479> a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
ran in he's like i'ma kill oh wait a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.290 
ran in he's like i'ma kill oh wait a
second<00:04:23.200> i'm<00:04:23.860> still<00:04:24.130> he<00:04:24.520> dies<00:04:24.729> and<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:25.180> he

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
second i'm still he dies and then he

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.920 
second i'm still he dies and then he
turns<00:04:25.510> six<00:04:25.930> after<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.680> it's<00:04:26.770> like

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
turns six after that and it's like

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.150 
turns six after that and it's like
that<00:04:27.050> would<00:04:27.169> have<00:04:27.259> been<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.410> game-changing<00:04:27.919> as

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
that would have been a game-changing as

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.540 
that would have been a game-changing as
my<00:04:28.340> art<00:04:28.580> out<00:04:28.880> where<00:04:29.060> Korea<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:30.070> do<00:04:31.070> think<00:04:31.370> if

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
my art out where Korea I do think if

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.159 
my art out where Korea I do think if
they<00:04:31.699> put<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> due<00:04:32.180> diligence<00:04:32.360> into<00:04:32.900> setting

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
they put the due diligence into setting

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.930 
they put the due diligence into setting
up<00:04:33.289> for<00:04:33.380> team<00:04:33.590> fights<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.009> way<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:34.280> do<00:04:34.340> for

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
up for team fights the way they do for

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.629 
up for team fights the way they do for
their<00:04:35.120> early<00:04:35.570> game<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.560> playing<00:04:37.130> the
