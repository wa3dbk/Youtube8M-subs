00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
1280 by 800 display and active digitizer

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.240 
1280 by 800 display and active digitizer
included<00:00:19.810> as<00:00:20.050> standard<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:20.890> take<00:00:21.039> a<00:00:21.070> look

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
included as standard so we take a look

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.740 
included as standard so we take a look
around<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.580> outside<00:00:22.000> first<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.480> all<00:00:22.570> the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
around the outside first of all the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.630 
around the outside first of all the
hardware<00:00:23.199> and<00:00:23.439> then<00:00:24.130> we'll<00:00:24.250> take<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.429> little

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
hardware and then we'll take a little

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.400 
hardware and then we'll take a little
look<00:00:24.820> at<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> software<00:00:25.240> particularly<00:00:26.170> how

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
look at the software particularly how

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.560 
look at the software particularly how
the<00:00:26.470> active<00:00:27.250> digitizer<00:00:27.400> solution<00:00:28.390> is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
the active digitizer solution is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.499 
the active digitizer solution is
implemented<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:30.460> start<00:00:31.029> by<00:00:31.119> taking<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.480> look

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
implemented so start by taking a look

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.250 
implemented so start by taking a look
around<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.990> outside<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.650> device<00:00:32.890> on<00:00:34.260> the

disabled or it can be left on which is
probably<00:01:01.540> how<00:01:01.720> most<00:01:02.020> people<00:01:02.350> who<00:01:02.470> use<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.890> on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
probably how most people who use that on

that the cursor is moving around the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.000 
that the cursor is moving around the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
about 10 millimeters then the screen is

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.960 
about 10 millimeters then the screen is
picking<00:04:40.720> up<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.050> proximity<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.040> pen<00:04:42.280> and

picking up the proximity of the pen and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.940 
picking up the proximity of the pen and
when<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.210> happens<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:44.080> capacitive<00:04:44.710> layer

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
having an active digitizer so without
