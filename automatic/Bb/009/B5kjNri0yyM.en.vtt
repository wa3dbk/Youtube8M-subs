00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:07.320
 planned the hole punch open all 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.380
 only by unlocking from the bottom it 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 just follow the patterns on the base 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.160

 hold the bottom right and press 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.780
 you get a very precise cut 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.060
 to extend it and make a border to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 once again in the hole 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 following the silver lines and press 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.799
 in short, that's how it is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.439
 possible to expand the rafters take 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.680
 the last one squeezed the whole heitz oven 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.680
 bach 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 make sure to be on the line is 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.189
 perforated again the subspecified you see 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.570
 that the rafters are a little wider 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 you can remove what's left with 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.850
 your nails here is how you can 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.100
 change their form to work the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.989
 size of the rafters do not forget this 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.220
 adage it is by forging that one becomes 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.709
 ex blacksmith or really wants 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.989
 experienced you can even realized some 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.630
 ultra thin lines by simply moving 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.640
 the rafters more to the right or the 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.290
 left 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.930
 train yourself again and again here is a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.910
 Another fun example saved us 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.910
 tron chevrons cheron 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.170
 discreet and you will see when you 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.780
 tilt your puncher she 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.330
 has two silver lines there at the bottom 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.300
 this is the beginning of this arrow and the end 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.240
 of this one so I'm lying with 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:00.100
 a marker to better see them that helps 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.870
 to align perfectly if you want 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.160
 to do more complicated things his 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:15.040
 fans it's you are directly at the edge 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.530
 of the page if you return the paper 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.620
 and insert it again with teeth on 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:30.400
 this line down there they should be 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:33.220
 connected connectors like that another 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.140
 funny thing is that if you have 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.980
 some herringbone pegs 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:44.920
 you can nest them neurons it 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.810
 locked up current 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.459
 if you have two they can 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:57.489
 easily be a lighter to do 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:04:01.800
 a nice border to bring them closer and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.800
 hang the rafters one on the other 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.100
 and what's fun is that you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.489
 can move them to do all 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:17.919
 kinds of angels very rough motives 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.430
 here is my border I find him an air a 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.430
 not very romantic 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.590
 so I'm going to finish this page of 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.460
 scrapbooking a day of course I the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.030
 discover and at the right size s 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.590
 I will add my photo 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.840
 and the idea is to add a few 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.400
 small ornaments and maybe to stick 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:44.090
 some branches and leaves there 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:46.870
 in of course some hearts and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.450
 flowers must be scattered here and there 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.510
 I 'm not finished with this page yet 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.060
 no wedding photo without kaka heart 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.190
 that's the idea and I'm going to continue to 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:05.270
 play with until being content with 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:10.520
 rendering should be really cute a 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.950
 times finished ok now you are you 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.770
 ask what to do with all these remains 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:21.140
 you made your borders and recover 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:23.600
 piles of fall like this one must 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.860
 obviously keep them that's what 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.360
 you can do with all these little ones 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.800
 parts 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.390
 you can use them to say 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.390
 hugs and kisses in the box 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.590
 you can collect them up in 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.960
 have tons and stick them on 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:49.480
 birthday cards simply with 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.480
 the glue you can group them all 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.849
 or you can be really creative and 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.519
 cut them each into two well at 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.469
 middle of all the colors then in 

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:17.839
 make a scary patch for a pattern like 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:20.199
 this one was going to same problem I'm 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.199
