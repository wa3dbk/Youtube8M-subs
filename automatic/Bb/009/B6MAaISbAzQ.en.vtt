the way this circuit supposed to run
this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> filter<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.590> which<00:00:52.770> i'm

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
this is a filter by the way which i'm

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220 
this is a filter by the way which i'm
not<00:00:53.129> using<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> power<00:00:54.480> source<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
not using it's for a power source that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.150 
not using it's for a power source that
the<00:00:55.860> energy<00:00:56.370> comes<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.980> supposedly<00:00:58.980> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the energy comes into here supposedly in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.090 
the energy comes into here supposedly in
a<00:00:59.219> normal<00:00:59.489> circuit<00:01:00.059> run<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
a normal circuit run to this the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.439 
a normal circuit run to this the
transistor<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> coils<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
transistor and the coils in the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.320 
transistor and the coils in the
capacitor<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:05.339> supposedly<00:01:05.909> feeds

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
capacitor and then supposedly feeds

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.520 
capacitor and then supposedly feeds
feeds<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.380> load<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.360> circuit<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
feeds the load but on this circuit it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
feeds the load but on this circuit it's
all<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> direction<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> anyway<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
all going that direction so anyway it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
all going that direction so anyway it
does<00:01:14.310> work<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.119> amazing<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.990> watch

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
does work it's an amazing thing to watch

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.260 
does work it's an amazing thing to watch
and<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.860> entered<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.250> part<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.240> i

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and I entered a part to it right here i

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.440 
and I entered a part to it right here i
put<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> charged<00:01:18.810> battery<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> come

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
put a charged battery in it and you come

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.080 
put a charged battery in it and you come
off<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> leds<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> charged

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
off the leds and you go into a charged

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
off the leds and you go into a charged
battery<00:01:24.180> before<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.259> hits<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> switching

comes off the circuit here with one wire
this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.050> going

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
this is going

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.340 
this is going
into<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.360> these<00:02:15.360> wires<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:16.110> are

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
into there and these wires here are

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.050 
into there and these wires here are
strictly<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> go<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.280> capacitor<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
strictly to go to the capacitor and the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.880 
strictly to go to the capacitor and the
meter<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.540> show<00:02:18.750> what's<00:02:18.960> going<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890

switching diodes and the LEDs they all

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.540 
switching diodes and the LEDs they all
face<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.180> direction<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.280> something

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
face that direction so that's something

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.760 
face that direction so that's something
to<00:02:32.700> remember<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.080> amp<00:02:34.290> draw<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.620> a

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.690 
right about now I've got enough push on
that<00:03:35.790> thing<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:37.620> shove<00:03:37.950> energy<00:03:38.460> in<00:03:38.550> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
that thing to shove energy in that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.730 
that thing to shove energy in that
battery<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.480> did<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.870> last<00:03:40.140> night<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.710> a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
battery and I did this last night with a

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.560 
battery and I did this last night with a
couple<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.130> half<00:03:41.340> dead<00:03:41.610> nine<00:03:41.850> volts<00:03:42.270> just<00:03:42.450> to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
couple of half dead nine volts just to

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.450 
couple of half dead nine volts just to
see<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.990> worked<00:03:43.260> before<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.680> ran<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.100> video

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
see if it worked before I ran this video

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.400 
see if it worked before I ran this video
and<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.880> does<00:03:45.090> work<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.510> looks<00:03:45.660> quite<00:03:45.960> well<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
and it does work it looks quite well and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.270 
and it does work it looks quite well and
I'm<00:03:47.100> using<00:03:48.050> alkaline<00:03:49.050> batteries<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.040> better

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
I'm using alkaline batteries the better

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.490 
I'm using alkaline batteries the better
thing<00:03:50.580> would<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.180> nickel<00:03:51.780> metal<00:03:51.900> hydrides

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
thing would be the nickel metal hydrides

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.560 
thing would be the nickel metal hydrides
but<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.070> alkalines<00:03:53.580> do<00:03:53.880> work<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.300> something

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
but the alkalines do work on something

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.140 
but the alkalines do work on something
like<00:03:54.900> this<00:03:55.190> don't<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.490> energies<00:03:56.850> just

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
like this don't see the energies just

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.670

keeps<00:03:57.360> right<00:03:57.570> on<00:03:57.600> climbing<00:03:58.170> on<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.440> thing

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
keeps right on climbing on this thing

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.620 
keeps right on climbing on this thing
this<00:03:59.310> would<00:03:59.490> probably<00:03:59.670> actually<00:04:00.030> charge<00:04:00.510> a

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
this would probably actually charge a

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.720 
this would probably actually charge a
12-volt<00:04:01.170> battery<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.710> go<00:04:01.950> very<00:04:02.250> very<00:04:02.310> very

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
12-volt battery it go very very very

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.720 
12-volt battery it go very very very
slow<00:04:03.200> but<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.230> think<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> course<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.370> time

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
slow but I think in the course of time

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.930 
slow but I think in the course of time
you<00:04:06.300> would<00:04:06.420> actually<00:04:06.720> put<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> charge<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:07.470> this

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you would actually put a charge on this

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.850 
you would actually put a charge on this
this<00:04:08.940> thing<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:10.020> average<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.500> probably<00:04:10.770> very

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
this thing the average is probably very

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.700 
this thing the average is probably very
very<00:04:11.100> low<00:04:11.520> on<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.230> there<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
very low on this but it is there and it

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.200 
very low on this but it is there and it
is<00:04:13.770> enough<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.310> put<00:04:14.340> energy<00:04:14.640> in<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.000> little

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
is enough to put energy in a little

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.130 
is enough to put energy in a little
battery<00:04:15.480> like<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.250> ok<00:04:17.250> I'm<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:18.140> ground

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
battery like that ok I'm going to ground

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.870 
battery like that ok I'm going to ground
out<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.650> cap<00:04:19.980> now<00:04:20.310> you're<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.670> to<00:04:20.730> see<00:04:20.850> a

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
out the cap now you're going to see a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.590 
out the cap now you're going to see a
big<00:04:21.150> spark<00:04:21.540> happen<00:04:22.020> right<00:04:22.140> here

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.050 

ok<00:04:27.600> now<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.840> caps<00:04:28.200> grounded<00:04:28.710> out<00:04:28.830> again<00:04:29.190> that

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
ok now the caps grounded out again that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.690 
ok now the caps grounded out again that
went<00:04:30.300> back<00:04:30.510> down<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.960> zero<00:04:31.460> now<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.610> I'm

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
went back down to zero now what I'm

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.890 
went back down to zero now what I'm
going<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.030> here<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.330> I'm<00:04:33.480> going<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.630> put<00:04:33.780> the

going to do here is I'm going to put the

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.470 
going to do here is I'm going to put the

battery on it if I can get this done
here<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.480> show<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:40.140> thing<00:04:40.440> still

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
here is to show that this thing still

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.870 
here is to show that this thing still
runs<00:04:41.040> with<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> battery<00:04:41.520> hooked<00:04:41.910> up<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:46.880> see

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
runs with a battery hooked up to it see

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.490 
runs with a battery hooked up to it see
the<00:04:48.000> lights<00:04:48.180> went<00:04:48.480> out<00:04:48.600> I'm<00:04:49.020> going<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.200> put<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the lights went out I'm going to put the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.910 
the lights went out I'm going to put the
battery<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.040> now<00:04:51.680> there<00:04:52.680> go<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.830> lights

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
battery on it now there go the lights

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.990 
battery on it now there go the lights
back<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.610> again<00:04:58.280> now<00:04:59.280> I've<00:04:59.400> got<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.670> battery

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
back on again now I've got the battery

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.700 
back on again now I've got the battery
on<00:05:00.090> here<00:05:00.390> no<00:05:00.570> more<00:05:00.750> capacitor<00:05:01.470> that's<00:05:01.920> done

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
on here no more capacitor that's done

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.440 
on here no more capacitor that's done
and<00:05:04.710> like<00:05:04.860> I<00:05:05.010> say<00:05:05.220> what's<00:05:05.490> happening<00:05:05.970> here<00:05:06.240> is

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
and like I say what's happening here is

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.260 
and like I say what's happening here is
I've<00:05:06.750> got<00:05:06.990> energy<00:05:07.440> coming<00:05:07.890> out<00:05:08.270> supposedly

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
I've got energy coming out supposedly

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.990 
I've got energy coming out supposedly
the<00:05:09.720> one<00:05:09.900> water<00:05:10.170> hitting<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.220> then

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
the one water hitting this and then

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.360 
the one water hitting this and then
something's<00:05:12.540> happening<00:05:13.140> here<00:05:13.560> because

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
something's happening here because

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.150 
something's happening here because
energy<00:05:14.640> is<00:05:14.880> flowing<00:05:15.120> back<00:05:15.630> into<00:05:15.660> this<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.590> I'm

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
energy is flowing back into this and I'm

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.790 
energy is flowing back into this and I'm
capturing<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.090> in<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.690> battery<00:05:19.230> right<00:05:19.440> there

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
capturing it in that battery right there

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.880 
capturing it in that battery right there
and<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.730> is<00:05:20.910> an<00:05:21.060> amazing<00:05:21.300> thing<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.440> amp<00:05:22.650> cry

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
and this is an amazing thing the amp cry

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.740 
and this is an amazing thing the amp cry
went<00:05:23.130> up<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.340> little<00:05:23.550> bit<00:05:23.730> went<00:05:23.970> up<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.240> about<00:05:24.390> 10

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
went up a little bit went up to about 10

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.620 
went up a little bit went up to about 10
milliamps<00:05:25.470> but<00:05:26.250> I'm<00:05:26.370> still<00:05:26.669> way<00:05:27.060> down<00:05:27.090> there

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
milliamps but I'm still way down there

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.780 
milliamps but I'm still way down there
and<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:28.350> could<00:05:28.560> do<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.919> for<00:05:29.160> days<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.640> days

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
and I could do this for days and days

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.270 
and I could do this for days and days
and<00:05:29.850> days<00:05:30.120> I've<00:05:30.480> decided<00:05:30.840> at<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.140> eight<00:05:32.070> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
and days I've decided at that eight to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.550 
and days I've decided at that eight to
10<00:05:32.490> milli<00:05:32.730> amp<00:05:32.970> draw<00:05:33.180> right<00:05:33.570> there<00:05:33.840> I<00:05:34.020> just

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
10 milli amp draw right there I just

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.110 
10 milli amp draw right there I just
swap<00:05:34.800> batteries<00:05:35.010> back<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.610> forth<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.000> the
