00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.840
 we women the hair is a 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.510
 important and good theme and or texture 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.650
 today I bring you a restorative lotion 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.449
 tips to stimulate the brightness of the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.179
 hair and you can not imagine the 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.060
 ingredients here are simple 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.460
 easy this insurance do not have in your house 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.640
 let's start with white vinegar 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 white vinegar is well known because 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 brings a lot of shine to hair 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.109
 we have a beer as well as listening 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 tell your husband love I need a 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.550
 beer is what you have in the fridge 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.829
 but not to take my hair 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.460
 the beer contains yeast and contributes 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.160
 a lot of freshness, volume and brightness 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.160
 excessive for the hair and finally the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.320
 milk preferably that is whole 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.120
 because milk will give us fat 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.939
 will provide us with proteins and we will 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.550
 have a pump lotion so let's 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.910
 set it up 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.040
 super easy you are going to need also a 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.320
 sprayer that you can have in your house 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
 You can also get it from a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 bottle that you have already used because 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 the idea is that we are not going to place in 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.620
 hair like spray form and this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 It's very easy, girls, let's mix the 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.050
 ingredients you are going to place with your finger 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.300
 a marquita and they are going to place the milk 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.800
 first more or less a little finger of milk 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.430
 that are about two tablespoons 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.430
 big 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.070
 the star princess 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.070
 the same amount of beer 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.759
 the beer alone in itself gives a lot 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.200
 shine to the hair but let's make a 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.289
 lotion that also has effect 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.719

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.710

 take better spoon 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.910
