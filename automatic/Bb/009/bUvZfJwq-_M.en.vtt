00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.979 
off so now I have another red card so
now<00:03:03.609> if<00:03:03.700> he<00:03:03.790> hits<00:03:03.939> me<00:03:04.090> again<00:03:04.239> he'll<00:03:04.599> be<00:03:04.629> forced

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
now if he hits me again he'll be forced

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.750 
now if he hits me again he'll be forced
out<00:03:05.169> and<00:03:05.680> he'll<00:03:05.829> lose<00:03:05.950> his<00:03:06.010> agility

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
out and he'll lose his agility

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.429 
out and he'll lose his agility
so<00:03:07.239> I<00:03:07.269> actually<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:07.719> for<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> recovery<00:03:08.290> here

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
so I actually go for the recovery here

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.750 
so I actually go for the recovery here
because<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.709> know<00:03:08.769> I<00:03:08.889> can<00:03:09.040> live<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:09.189> meteor<00:03:09.549> mash

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
because I know I can live a meteor mash

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.819 
because I know I can live a meteor mash
but<00:03:10.389> unfortunately<00:03:10.959> he<00:03:11.049> gets<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.260> critical<00:03:11.650> hit

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
but unfortunately he gets a critical hit

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.830 
but unfortunately he gets a critical hit
so<00:03:12.189> that's<00:03:12.400> not<00:03:12.549> good<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:13.090> didn't<00:03:13.599> really<00:03:13.750> get

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
so that's not good I didn't really get

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.679 
so that's not good I didn't really get
to<00:03:13.989> use<00:03:14.079> my<00:03:14.109> DX<00:03:14.530> as<00:03:14.709> much<00:03:14.919> I<00:03:15.760> guess<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.599> to

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
to use my DX as much I guess I have to

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.479 
to use my DX as much I guess I have to
try<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.900> out<00:03:17.109> again<00:03:17.169> in<00:03:17.500> another<00:03:17.709> battle<00:03:18.040> I'm

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
try it out again in another battle I'm

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.089 
try it out again in another battle I'm
gonna<00:03:18.669> set<00:03:18.819> up<00:03:18.909> my<00:03:18.940> level<00:03:19.419> 1<00:03:19.659> Aaron<00:03:19.959> I'm<00:03:20.919> gonna

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
me off guard like ASAP so now I'm going

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.099 
me off guard like ASAP so now I'm going
to<00:03:54.909> predict<00:03:55.180> him<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.329> switch<00:03:55.540> out<00:03:55.720> because<00:03:55.840> I

to predict him to switch out because I
don't<00:03:56.470> really<00:03:56.620> think<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.340> despite<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.759> cow

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909

don't really think the despite the cow
mind<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.209> don't<00:03:58.299> think<00:03:58.540> he<00:03:58.629> can<00:03:58.780> do<00:03:58.900> anything<00:03:59.199> to

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
mind I don't think he can do anything to

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.929 
mind I don't think he can do anything to
me<00:03:59.439> and<00:03:59.739> I<00:04:00.009> don't<00:04:00.069> think<00:04:00.250> he<00:04:00.430> wants<00:04:00.639> to<00:04:00.669> risk

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
me and I don't think he wants to risk

me and I don't think he wants to risk
getting<00:04:01.120> crunched<00:04:01.569> on<00:04:01.689> so<00:04:02.229> I'm<00:04:02.290> gonna<00:04:02.409> go<00:04:02.530> for

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
getting crunched on so I'm gonna go for

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.289 
getting crunched on so I'm gonna go for
the<00:04:02.739> pursuit

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
the pursuit

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.879 
the pursuit
oh<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:05.019> funny<00:04:05.199> thing<00:04:05.379> I<00:04:05.409> don't<00:04:05.560> even<00:04:05.709> have

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
oh the funny thing I don't even have

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.770 
oh the funny thing I don't even have
crunch<00:04:06.159> on<00:04:06.400> this<00:04:06.519> Tyranitar<00:04:07.060> he<00:04:07.599> probably

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
crunch on this Tyranitar he probably

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.050 
crunch on this Tyranitar he probably
wasn't<00:04:07.989> expecting<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.500> pursuit<00:04:08.829> but<00:04:09.489> he<00:04:09.879> gets

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
wasn't expecting the pursuit but he gets

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.879 
wasn't expecting the pursuit but he gets
I<00:04:10.269> get<00:04:10.479> the<00:04:10.599> curse<00:04:10.780> body<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.290> my<00:04:11.409> pursue<00:04:11.769> it

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
I get the curse body on my pursue it

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.580 
I get the curse body on my pursue it
doesn't<00:04:12.129> really<00:04:12.220> matter<00:04:12.430> anyways<00:04:13.379> he's<00:04:14.379> under

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
doesn't really matter anyways he's under

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.620 
doesn't really matter anyways he's under
the<00:04:14.650> boat<00:04:14.829> burrow<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.340> Rose<00:04:15.669> do<00:04:15.909> as<00:04:16.120> death

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
the boat burrow to Rose do as death

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.659 
the boat burrow to Rose do as death
father<00:04:16.840> probably<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> that's<00:04:18.370> good<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.549> I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
father probably so that's good that I

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.249 
father probably so that's good that I
had<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.909> stealth<00:04:19.120> rock<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.479> he's<00:04:19.930> gonna<00:04:20.019> send

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
had to stealth rock so he's gonna send

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.839 
had to stealth rock so he's gonna send
out<00:04:20.380> his<00:04:20.500> burn<00:04:20.739> girl<00:04:20.949> again<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.519> it's<00:04:21.729> going

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
out his burn girl again and it's going

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.040 
out his burn girl again and it's going
to<00:04:21.909> dive<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.210> stealth<00:04:22.510> rocks<00:04:22.719> so<00:04:22.930> he

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
to dive to the stealth rocks so he

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.089 
to dive to the stealth rocks so he
probably<00:04:23.229> should<00:04:23.500> have<00:04:23.529> saved<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.830> for

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
probably should have saved that for

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.680 
probably should have saved that for
later<00:04:24.279> but<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.120> guess

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
later but I guess

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230 
later but I guess
married<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.980> now<00:04:27.100> we<00:04:27.160> sent<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.460> a<00:04:27.520> 0zu<00:04:28.000> Qian

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
married so now we sent that a 0zu Qian

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.860 
married so now we sent that a 0zu Qian
and<00:04:29.850> obviously<00:04:30.850> I'm<00:04:31.210> scared<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
zucchini it might not be a bad idea

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.530 
zucchini it might not be a bad idea
despite<00:04:53.560> because<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.330> repression<00:04:55.330> that

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
despite because of the repression that

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.410 
despite because of the repression that
be<00:04:55.780> running<00:04:56.080> around<00:04:56.170> and<00:04:56.650> stuff<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:57.970> don't

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
be running around and stuff but I don't

be running around and stuff but I don't
think<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.840> really<00:04:59.320> useful<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.400> most

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
think it's really useful in most
