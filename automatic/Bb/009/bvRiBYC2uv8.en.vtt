00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
start to really bad because I really had

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.910 
start to really bad because I really had

to go to a TDM with 64 players just

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.250 
to go to a TDM with 64 players just
because<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.430> get<00:03:23.640> all<00:03:23.880> those<00:03:24.120> Granite<00:03:24.690> Hills<00:03:24.990> I

because to get all those Granite Hills I

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260 
because to get all those Granite Hills I
mean<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.650> could<00:03:26.100> simply<00:03:26.520> get<00:03:26.730> them<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
mean I could simply get them on the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.750 
mean I could simply get them on the
normal<00:03:27.660> maps<00:03:27.870> or<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.500> close<00:03:29.040> quarters<00:03:29.550> or

normal maps or in close quarters or

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.510 
normal maps or in close quarters or
everywhere<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.510> would<00:03:30.660> take<00:03:30.930> more<00:03:31.170> time

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520

personally<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:33.030> love<00:03:33.240> this<00:03:33.390> weapon<00:03:33.750> I

personally I really love this weapon I

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.960 
personally I really love this weapon I
like<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.350> after<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.100> patch<00:03:35.340> even<00:03:35.760> more

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
like it after the patch even more

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760 
like it after the patch even more
because<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.900> really<00:03:37.140> good<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.500> has<00:03:37.740> a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
because it's really really good it has a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.190 
because it's really really good it has a
lower<00:03:38.040> recoil<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.730> still<00:03:39.270> produces<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> very

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
lower recoil and still produces a very

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.199 
lower recoil and still produces a very
good<00:03:40.470> damage<00:03:40.860> over<00:03:41.130> range<00:03:41.370> actually<00:03:42.150> after

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
good damage over range actually after

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.600 
good damage over range actually after
patch<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:42.810> actually<00:03:43.680> bigger<00:03:44.280> than<00:03:44.459> that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
patch it's actually bigger than that

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.970 
patch it's actually bigger than that
like<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.480> said<00:03:45.540> before<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.170> weapon<00:03:46.470> exited

the<00:03:53.940> iron<00:03:54.209> sights<00:03:54.600> we<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.440> don't<00:03:55.590> give<00:03:55.860> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
the iron sights we just don't give you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.770 
the iron sights we just don't give you
enough<00:03:56.100> space<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.640> see<00:03:57.060> your<00:03:57.209> target<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
enough space to see your target and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.449 
enough space to see your target and
therefore<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.410> usually<00:03:58.860> missed<00:03:59.070> a<00:03:59.160> lot<00:03:59.280> of

actually<00:04:31.720> everything<00:04:32.410> related<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:32.980> damage

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
actually everything related to damage

actually everything related to damage
the<00:04:33.970> head<00:04:34.150> multiplier<00:04:34.660> produces<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.230> damaged

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
the head multiplier produces a damaged

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.680 
the head multiplier produces a damaged

of a value of two times higher than a

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.080

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
normal upper chest damage of a one time

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.600 
normal upper chest damage of a one time
is<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.390> full<00:04:40.630> damage<00:04:41.020> if<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.920> shoot<00:04:42.100> someone

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
is the full damage if you shoot someone

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.930 
is the full damage if you shoot someone
the<00:04:42.970> legs<00:04:43.180> they<00:04:43.480> will<00:04:43.630> sustain<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:44.020> damaged<00:04:44.500> of

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
the legs they will sustain a damaged of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.250 
the legs they will sustain a damaged of
ninety-one<00:04:45.940> percent<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.480> maximum<00:04:46.930> bullet

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
ninety-one percent of maximum bullet

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.020 
ninety-one percent of maximum bullet
damage<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:47.830> actually<00:04:48.430> damage<00:04:48.850> would<00:04:48.970> be

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
damage so actually damage would be

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.600 
damage so actually damage would be
deducted<00:04:49.690> by<00:04:49.840> nine<00:04:50.320> percent<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.950> them<00:04:51.160> weapon

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
deducted by nine percent of them weapon

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.300 
deducted by nine percent of them weapon
damage<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.930> if<00:04:53.140> you<00:04:53.320> import<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:53.980> in<00:04:54.160> our

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
damage so if you import this in our

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.160 
damage so if you import this in our
damage<00:04:54.790> values<00:04:55.120> if<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.480> hit<00:04:55.660> an<00:04:55.780> enemy<00:04:55.960> in

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
damage values if you hit an enemy in

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.780 
damage values if you hit an enemy in
their<00:04:56.410> legs<00:04:56.680> they<00:04:56.920> will<00:04:57.040> stain<00:04:57.310> off<00:04:57.460> on<00:04:57.610> a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
their legs they will stain off on a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.910 
their legs they will stain off on a
maximum<00:04:58.270> damage<00:04:58.480> or<00:04:59.020> twenty-three<00:04:59.710> percent

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
maximum damage or twenty-three percent

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.490 
maximum damage or twenty-three percent
of<00:05:00.280> damage<00:05:00.640> a<00:05:00.880> chest<00:05:01.570> hit<00:05:01.810> would<00:05:02.020> produce<00:05:02.230> in

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
of damage a chest hit would produce in

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.200 
of damage a chest hit would produce in
twenty<00:05:02.830> five<00:05:03.070> percent<00:05:03.100> of<00:05:03.610> maximum<00:05:04.000> damage

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
twenty five percent of maximum damage

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.200 
twenty five percent of maximum damage
and<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.630> head<00:05:05.290> shot<00:05:05.560> would<00:05:05.890> hit<00:05:06.130> him<00:05:06.370> at<00:05:06.790> fifty

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
and the head shot would hit him at fifty

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.970 
and the head shot would hit him at fifty
percent<00:05:07.540> of<00:05:07.690> them<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.260> two<00:05:08.440> shots<00:05:08.470> are

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
percent of them so two shots are

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.860 
percent of them so two shots are

that<00:05:32.650> burst<00:05:32.920> firing<00:05:33.190> at<00:05:33.490> longer<00:05:33.790> ranges

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
that burst firing at longer ranges

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.660 
that burst firing at longer ranges
because<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.050> lower<00:05:35.230> recoil<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.950> also

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
because the lower recoil and also

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.550 
because the lower recoil and also
combined<00:05:37.090> with<00:05:37.330> under<00:05:37.660> slug<00:05:37.930> rail<00:05:38.110> or<00:05:38.290> the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
combined with under slug rail or the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.520 
combined with under slug rail or the
bipod<00:05:39.030> because<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.150> use<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.480> scar<00:05:40.750> at<00:05:40.960> medium

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
bipod because I use the scar at medium

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.740 
bipod because I use the scar at medium
to<00:05:41.740> long<00:05:41.890> range<00:05:41.920> distances<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:43.030> engage<00:05:43.300> enemy

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
to long range distances to engage enemy

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.800 
to long range distances to engage enemy
targets<00:05:44.200> I<00:05:44.380> would<00:05:44.890> suggest<00:05:45.010> using<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.670> g70<00:05:46.360> orgy

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810
