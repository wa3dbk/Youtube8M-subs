00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because it cuts closer to the knot still

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.069 
because it cuts closer to the knot still
need<00:00:32.550> scissors<00:00:35.600> clear<00:00:36.600> nail<00:00:36.809> polish<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:39.079> your

need scissors clear nail polish and your

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.209 
need scissors clear nail polish and your
choice<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.649> whatever<00:00:41.070> color<00:00:41.430> beads<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:43.219> then

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
choice of whatever color beads and then

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
choice of whatever color beads and then
it's<00:00:44.399> also<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:45.030> choice<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.989> want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> use

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it's also your choice if you want to use

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.889 
it's also your choice if you want to use
a<00:00:46.559> beading<00:00:46.980> needle<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.660> them

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
a beading needle I like to use them

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.350 
a beading needle I like to use them
because<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.980> speeds<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> process<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because it speeds up the process and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.750 
because it speeds up the process and
it's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.110> easier<00:00:53.180> but<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.809> choice

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
it's a lot easier but it's your choice

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's a lot easier but it's your choice
so<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> beading<00:00:58.320> needle<00:00:58.940> then

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so if you do use a beading needle then

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
so if you do use a beading needle then
there<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> hole<00:01:02.000> inside<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.500> stick<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
there is a hole inside and stick you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
there is a hole inside and stick you
stick<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.100> string<00:01:05.689> through<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> pull<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
stick your string through it and pull it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
stick your string through it and pull it
down<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> ends<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.630> you're<00:01:09.630> not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
down to one of the ends if you're not

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.800 
down to one of the ends if you're not
using<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.290> beading<00:01:10.590> needle<00:01:10.909> then<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.659> go

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
using a beading needle then just go

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
using a beading needle then just go
ahead<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.140> start<00:01:13.350> beating<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> string

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
ahead and start beating on the string

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.800 
ahead and start beating on the string
and<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.530> need<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> ruler<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.850> measure<00:01:18.210> how

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and you also need a ruler to measure how

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
and you also need a ruler to measure how
long<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.740> bracelet<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.799> pattern<00:01:23.159> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
long your bracelet is so the pattern I'm

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.810 
long your bracelet is so the pattern I'm
going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> use<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.740> three<00:01:25.740> blue<00:01:25.979> beads<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

clear bead it looks just like that and
these<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.369> examples<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> bracelets

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
these are some examples of the bracelets

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
these are some examples of the bracelets

of beads this has about seven and this
has<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.649> five<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.689> fit<00:01:45.960> an

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.399 

I'm<00:01:55.030> going<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.479> start<00:01:55.780> beating<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.900> three

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
I'm going to start beating the three

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.660 
I'm going to start beating the three
blues<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.150> one<00:02:01.150> clear<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.890> if<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.369> use<00:02:06.640> a

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
blues and one clear so if you use a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.670 
blues and one clear so if you use a
needle<00:02:07.080> then<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:09.160> will<00:02:09.490> get<00:02:09.610> filled<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.680> pretty

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
needle then it will get filled up pretty

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.040 
needle then it will get filled up pretty
quickly<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.620> pull<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.660> bead<00:02:16.660> down

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
quickly so then just pull the bead down

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.690 
quickly so then just pull the bead down
onto<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> string<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.850> like<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:20.700> start

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
onto the string just like that and start

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.940 
onto the string just like that and start
again<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:28.180> make<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> bracelet<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:29.019> about<00:02:29.230> two

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
again I can make a bracelet in about two

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.540 
again I can make a bracelet in about two
minutes<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.470> I've<00:02:32.590> been<00:02:32.830> doing<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.280> for<00:02:33.519> a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
minutes and but I've been doing it for a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.520 
minutes and but I've been doing it for a
while<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.780> doesn't<00:02:35.110> take<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> lot<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
while but it doesn't take a lot of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
while but it doesn't take a lot of
practice<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.390> learn<00:02:37.390> how<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.600> do<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.989> pretty

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
practice to learn how to do it pretty

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.240 
practice to learn how to do it pretty
quickly<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.700> very<00:02:39.760> simple<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:42.070> with<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
quickly it's very simple so with a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.240 
quickly it's very simple so with a
little<00:02:42.430> practice<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.570> can<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:45.130> about

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
little practice you can do it in about

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.470 
little practice you can do it in about
two<00:02:45.580> minutes<00:02:45.700> too

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.800 

so<00:02:51.200> when<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.099> think<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.930> my<00:02:54.680> beads<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:56.569> I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
so when I think that my beads that I

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.610 
so when I think that my beads that I
filled<00:02:57.110> my<00:02:57.230> string<00:02:57.620> enough<00:02:57.920> with<00:02:58.280> beads<00:02:59.620> going

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
filled my string enough with beads going

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.360 
filled my string enough with beads going
to<00:03:00.830> measure<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:03.470> about<00:03:04.360> 4<00:03:05.360> inches<00:03:06.370> so

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
to measure it that's about 4 inches so

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
to measure it that's about 4 inches so
I'm<00:03:07.519> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.940> bead<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.390> little<00:03:08.720> bit<00:03:08.840> more

better<00:03:57.380> if<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:58.329> pull<00:03:59.329> it<00:03:59.359> hard<00:04:00.549> so<00:04:01.549> then<00:04:02.230> going

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
better if you pull it hard so then going

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.740 
better if you pull it hard so then going
to<00:04:03.410> take<00:04:03.650> my<00:04:03.799> clear<00:04:04.040> nail<00:04:04.190> polish<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:07.540> put<00:04:08.540> a

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.050 
to take my clear nail polish and put a
little<00:04:09.200> drop<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.810> onto<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.440> knot<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:13.060> this

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
little drop of it onto the knot and this

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.490 
little drop of it onto the knot and this
just<00:04:14.569> sets<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.079> knot

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.009 

then<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:20.640> going<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:20.940> lay<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.299> down<00:04:21.450> for<00:04:21.810> about

then I'm going to lay it down for about

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.400 
then I'm going to lay it down for about
30<00:04:22.830> minutes<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.510> here's<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:24.960> has<00:04:25.020> been

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
laid down and it's dry so then I'm going

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.250 
laid down and it's dry so then I'm going
to<00:04:31.380> take<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:32.070> nail<00:04:32.280> clippers<00:04:32.750> just<00:04:33.750> clip<00:04:34.080> off

that string as close as I can get to the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.300 
that string as close as I can get to the
knot<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:39.620> then<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.770> have<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:40.980> finished
