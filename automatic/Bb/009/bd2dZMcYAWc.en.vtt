00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right so here's part two of the

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.849 
all right so here's part two of the
helmet<00:00:02.879> cooling<00:00:03.179> system<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.689> lot<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.650> had

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
helmet cooling system a lot of you had

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.320 
helmet cooling system a lot of you had
questions<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.910> would<00:00:06.000> be<00:00:06.060> hooked

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
questions about how it would be hooked

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.480 
questions about how it would be hooked
up<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.690> whatnot<00:00:06.839> so<00:00:07.319> let<00:00:07.980> me<00:00:08.069> start<00:00:08.280> off<00:00:08.370> with

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
up and whatnot so let me start off with

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.209 
up and whatnot so let me start off with
this<00:00:08.610> first<00:00:09.380> basically<00:00:10.380> this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> fan

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this first basically this is the fan

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.030 
this first basically this is the fan
system<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.730> kind<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.000> made<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.769> set<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.860> out<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
system I kind of made it set it out of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.140 
system I kind of made it set it out of
clay<00:00:16.070> basically<00:00:17.070> what<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.000> look

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
clay basically what it is is if you look

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880 
clay basically what it is is if you look
at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> bottom<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:18.930> there's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.680> little

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
at the bottom here there's a little

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
at the bottom here there's a little
space<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.400> between<00:00:20.430> between<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> top<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
space in between between the top of this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
space in between between the top of this
and<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.980> fan<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.910> what<00:00:24.510> that'll<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.320> since

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and the fan now what that'll do is since

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.089 
and the fan now what that'll do is since
I<00:00:25.830> block<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.310> off<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> if<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.090> put<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> piece<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
I block this off and if I put a piece of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.679 
I block this off and if I put a piece of
foam<00:00:29.099> across<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.699> bottom<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.420> seal

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
foam across the bottom of this to seal

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.959 
foam across the bottom of this to seal
it<00:00:30.869> it'll<00:00:31.650> draw<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:32.070> air<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> back<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it it'll draw an air from the back and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.120 
it it'll draw an air from the back and
have<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.149> cut<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.660> spots<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have to cut out two spots here this is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.220 
have to cut out two spots here this is
actually<00:00:35.250> for<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.239> Chicago<00:00:36.719> style<00:00:36.899> bolts

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
actually for the Chicago style bolts

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
actually for the Chicago style bolts
that<00:00:37.290> hold<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> center<00:00:38.010> part<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.820> which

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that hold down the center part so which

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
that hold down the center part so which
I<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.059> then<00:00:42.210> basically

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I just use like that and then basically

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.970 
I just use like that and then basically
just<00:00:42.629> countersink<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> video<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
just countersink it there's a video on

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.229 
just countersink it there's a video on
it<00:00:44.129> I'll<00:00:44.219> try<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> add<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> link<00:00:45.059> down<00:00:45.210> below

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it I'll try and add the link down below

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.720 
it I'll try and add the link down below
somewhere<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.320> word<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:47.129> about<00:00:47.309> here

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
somewhere the word and right about here

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.700 
somewhere the word and right about here
somewhere<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:49.620> basically<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:51.710> we're

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
somewhere and basically what we're

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.160 
somewhere and basically what we're
trying<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.039> pull<00:00:53.219> air<00:00:53.399> through<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.170> then

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
trying to pull air through here and then

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.750 
trying to pull air through here and then
push<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> top<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.399> seal<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
push it up the top so if you seal this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
push it up the top so if you seal this
across<00:00:57.440> basically<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.829> whole

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
across basically you have this whole

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
across basically you have this whole
area<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> blow<00:00:59.579> air<00:00:59.820> across<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:01.260> may<00:01:01.770> have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
area to blow air across now I may have

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500 
area to blow air across now I may have
to<00:01:02.100> cut<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> back<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> helmet<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to cut into the back of the helmet a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
to cut into the back of the helmet a
little<00:01:03.870> bit<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.159> least<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.430> get

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
little bit to do that but at least I get

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.649 
little bit to do that but at least I get
some<00:01:05.670> airflow<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> helmet<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> haven't

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
some airflow in the helmet I haven't

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
some airflow in the helmet I haven't
seen<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:06.990> many<00:01:07.140> irony<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.619> helmets<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
seen very many irony and helmets that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
seen very many irony and helmets that
have<00:01:08.240> fans<00:01:09.240> installed<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.510> but<00:01:12.510> as

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have fans installed into them so but as

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
have fans installed into them so but as
far<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.869> how<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.710> hooked<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
far as how this would be hooked up this

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.840 
far as how this would be hooked up this
would<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.119> either<00:01:15.450> hooked<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
would actually be either hooked up to a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.690 
would actually be either hooked up to a
plow<00:01:17.850> Lou<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.299> Audrina<00:01:19.140> board<00:01:20.150> with<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
plow Lou or Audrina board with on one

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.899 
plow Lou or Audrina board with on one
channels<00:01:24.180> basically<00:01:24.630> set<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.020> as<00:01:25.170> an<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.759> or

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
channels basically set up as an on or

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.270 
channels basically set up as an on or
off<00:01:26.939> type<00:01:28.220> accessory<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:31.530> real<00:01:31.829> proper

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
off type accessory now the real proper

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
off type accessory now the real proper
way<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.299> be<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.890> get<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
way to do it would actually be to get a

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
way to do it would actually be to get a
temperature<00:01:35.250> sensor<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.540> stick<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.900> on

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
temperature sensor and then stick it on

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.350 
temperature sensor and then stick it on
the<00:01:37.170> inside<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> helmet<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.180> in<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the inside of the helmet here in the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.490 
the inside of the helmet here in the
back<00:01:39.540> or<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> dryer<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> front<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.500> if

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
back or in the dryer up in front and if

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.929 
back or in the dryer up in front and if
the<00:01:44.040> temperature<00:01:44.430> reaches<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> certain

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the temperature reaches a certain

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.690 
the temperature reaches a certain
temperature<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:46.200> tells<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.740> Adreno<00:01:47.250> or<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
temperature it tells the Adreno or the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.249 
temperature it tells the Adreno or the
plow<00:01:47.909> Lou<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.540> go<00:01:48.630> ahead<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.840> keep<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> fan

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
plow Lou do to go ahead and keep the fan

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.920 
plow Lou do to go ahead and keep the fan
on<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.649> know<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.880> certain<00:01:51.479> temperature

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
on I know there are certain temperature

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.630 
on I know there are certain temperature
sensors<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.740> purchase<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.369> are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
sensors that you can purchase that are

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.420 
sensors that you can purchase that are
set<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.000> certain<00:01:54.390> degrees<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.680> basically<00:01:56.070> it's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
set to certain degrees so basically it's

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300 
set to certain degrees so basically it's
if<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.210> below<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> temperature<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.740> powers

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
if it's below the temperature the powers

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
if it's below the temperature the powers
not<00:01:59.520> turned<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.600> once<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> reaches

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
not turned on but once it reaches

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
not turned on but once it reaches
temperature<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> kicks<00:02:02.070> power<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
temperature it kicks power on and it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.020 
temperature it kicks power on and it
allows<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.469> fan<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:04.920> operated<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.729> that'd

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
allows the fan to be operated so that'd

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.399 
allows the fan to be operated so that'd
be<00:02:06.180> that'd<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.979> Audrina<00:02:08.369> or

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
be that'd be one way the Audrina or

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.440 
be that'd be one way the Audrina or
Palala<00:02:10.409> board<00:02:10.739> would<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.159> the<00:02:11.849> first<00:02:12.120> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
Palala board would be that the first and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.759 
Palala board would be that the first and
then<00:02:12.659> the<00:02:12.750> third<00:02:12.989> way<00:02:13.200> would<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
then the third way would be just a

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.830 
then the third way would be just a
regular<00:02:13.890> switch<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.239> gets<00:02:15.299> too<00:02:15.510> hot<00:02:15.690> you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
regular switch so if it gets too hot you

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.619 
regular switch so if it gets too hot you
flick<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.530> flick<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.739> off<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.629> hope

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
flick it on and flick it off so hope

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.250 
flick it on and flick it off so hope
this<00:02:18.659> helps<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.560> guys<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> little<00:02:20.040> bit

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this helps for you guys a little bit

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.240 
this helps for you guys a little bit
this<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.379> basically<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
this is basically this is just a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.369 
this is basically this is just a
prototype<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.819> clay

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
prototype it's clay

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.640 
prototype it's clay
just<00:02:25.379> regular<00:02:25.500> clay<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.440> mock

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
just regular clay so just kind of mock

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.270 
just regular clay so just kind of mock
it<00:02:28.799> up<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:30.049> but<00:02:31.049> yeah<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.829> also<00:02:31.950> stick

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
it up and but yeah so you can also stick

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.500 
it up and but yeah so you can also stick
your<00:02:32.400> batteries<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:32.849> here<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.090> well<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.269> can

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
your batteries in here as well you can

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.910 
your batteries in here as well you can
stick<00:02:33.720> your<00:02:33.750> plugs<00:02:34.140> board<00:02:34.440> in<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.709> whatever

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
stick your plugs board in here whatever

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
stick your plugs board in here whatever
you're<00:02:35.730> getting<00:02:35.909> a<00:02:35.940> nice<00:02:36.030> cool<00:02:36.329> air<00:02:36.480> coming

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you're getting a nice cool air coming

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.600 
you're getting a nice cool air coming
over<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> top<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.040> bad

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
over the top of it so it's not that bad

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.140 
over the top of it so it's not that bad
so<00:02:40.250> depends<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.310> how<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.519> want<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.849> hook<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.060> up

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
so depends on how you want to hook it up

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.000 
so depends on how you want to hook it up
but<00:02:42.299> basically<00:02:42.629> that's<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.989> basic<00:02:43.590> principle

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
but basically that's the basic principle

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.099 
but basically that's the basic principle
of<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.220> fan<00:02:44.430> system<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.599> basically<00:02:45.930> you'd

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
of the fan system so basically you'd

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.330 
of the fan system so basically you'd
draw<00:02:46.319> air<00:02:46.530> from<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.799> back<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.190> helmet

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
draw air from the back of the helmet

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.039 
draw air from the back of the helmet
here<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.450> back<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:51.000> would<00:02:51.120> draw

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
here in the back and then it would draw

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.839 
here in the back and then it would draw
it<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:52.920> over<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.190> top<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.579> the

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
it in and then over the top of the

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.360 
it in and then over the top of the
faceplate<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.200> get<00:02:55.440> cool<00:02:55.620> cool<00:02:56.190> air

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
faceplate so you get cool cool air

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.460 
faceplate so you get cool cool air
running<00:02:56.730> down<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.090> way<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.319> then<00:02:58.409> you

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
running down this way so and then you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.530 
running down this way so and then you
could<00:02:58.620> obviously<00:02:58.829> vent<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.430> different<00:03:00.420> ways

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
could obviously vent it different ways

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.699 
could obviously vent it different ways
depending<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.200> want<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.590> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
depending on what you want to do you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.250 
depending on what you want to do you
could<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.340> put<00:03:02.810> little<00:03:03.810> slots<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.230> here

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
could you know put little slots in here

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.020 
could you know put little slots in here
to<00:03:04.500> push<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.799> air<00:03:04.920> down<00:03:05.099> across<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.579> face<00:03:05.730> or

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
to push the air down across your face or

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.059 
to push the air down across your face or
straight<00:03:06.510> down<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.989> depending<00:03:07.799> on<00:03:07.829> what<00:03:07.890> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
straight down just depending on what you
