 and yes, that's not really the case 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.869
 complicated and I have to do a few things 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.699
 hold 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.010
 or does one work quite well

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.010
 once a game of chance and find that

 below in the description and he at the end 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.420
 of the video again invites purely so 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.969
 that you switch to the channel once 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.390
 can and you look at the desired 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.390
 You can find the terms and conditions 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 you also in this video and there wishes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 Of course, then there is much fun there 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.949
 the great thing to win and now 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.949
 go and real purpose 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.030
 We start with the palm like it 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:34.590
 this is just what it is and that is 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:40.360
 a kind of attack up something 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.870
 wider is that it is on the side 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.970
 the thumb thumb 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.290
 just as every finger has one at the top 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.930
 ball the joint that the finger with the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.920
 hand then connects a small one 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.350
 speak for the parts between the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.570
 draw a joint, so to speak 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:14.130
 joint tip of the dow jones 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.130
 then here is the middle piece 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.030
 Already hand on and pay attention 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.110
 how the differences are for example 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.810
 the little finger there are the limbs 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.480
 to say shorter than the middle finger 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.850
 The middle finger is the longest finger 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.950
 ring finger as a tick bigger than that 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:45.820
 index finger the download ready 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:50.260
 The verses bend the joints and top 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.150
 the tips of the fingers are the ones 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.270
 End runs over the whole nerving 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.370
 so to speak 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.890
 That would give you a hand 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.720
 sketched that is actually that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.000
 basic framework of a hand and exactly with 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.560
 You can use any of these techniques 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.180
 Always draw a device away for hand 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.140
 take the palm of your hand 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:20.010
 slightly larger thumb and thumb 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:24.880
 then the little balls and painted the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.880
 without being here with it very quickly 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.150
 one can imagine how it is on the other hand 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.280
 It might be fast 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.160
 of course you have all the time 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.590
 the world, therefore, so do it all in peace 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.690
 try it a few times 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.060
 Of course, then also in the interior 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.390
 erase and the whole with one 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.360
 year market, so to speak round 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
 if it is a hand in the now for example 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.400
 should be manga style 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.430
 When drawing realistically you have to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.600
 add something more 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.510
 this is similar in the 1 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:10.900
 another video so then again one 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.600
 hand in the palm again here 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.750
 this rectangle will be a bit wider 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.550
 towards the top a little thicker joints for 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.370
 thumbs the little balls again 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.840
 yes, that's not a bad thing 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910
 complicated and i know you can do it 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.950
 that's how it's going to be for sure 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.640
 fantastic hinbekommen there simply 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.610
 Let a little try 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.050
 At the very beginning it should work just fine 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.330
 you do not make any mistake you 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.930
 collect the experience the most important 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.640
 is that you have fun from that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:53.860
 it's your turn le clos looks too 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.500
 google on the internet just pictures 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.650
 which hands look like that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:04.600
 positions that are rotated 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.450
 whole yes in everyday life looks like light 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.170
 and shadow falls depending on what for 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.340
 you want to use it you eg all 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.460
 as I said manga-style approach is 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:22.080
 always a bit coarser and simple 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.960
 kept as at realistic times 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.590
 so now it's your turn so le clos and have 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.400
 fun 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.400
 the selection 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.880
 on 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.550
 known 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.760
