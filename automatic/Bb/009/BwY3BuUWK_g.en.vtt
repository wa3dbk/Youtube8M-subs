some right you've actually didn't the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.219 
some right you've actually didn't the

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
blindfolded yep but how does that work

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.960 
blindfolded yep but how does that work
you<00:01:42.290> just<00:01:42.619> how<00:01:42.770> does<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.040> work<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.610> basically

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
you just how does it work you basically

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.609 
you just how does it work you basically
try<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.600> move<00:01:45.080> as<00:01:45.500> few<00:01:46.070> pieces<00:01:46.190> as<00:01:46.490> possible

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
try to move as few pieces as possible

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.899 
try to move as few pieces as possible
basically<00:01:48.619> you're<00:01:48.770> given<00:01:49.009> some<00:01:49.159> time<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.729> do

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
basically you're given some time to do

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.029 
basically you're given some time to do
an<00:01:50.210> inspection<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:51.649> from<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:51.950> you

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
an inspection and then from there you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.700 
an inspection and then from there you
put<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.190> blindfold<00:01:52.460> on<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.500> solve<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.590> whole

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
put the blindfold on you solve the whole

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.960 
put the blindfold on you solve the whole
cube<00:01:54.979> by<00:01:55.100> damage<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.549> mean<00:01:55.700> you've<00:01:55.850> been<00:01:55.880> doing

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
cube by damage I mean you've been doing

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.880 
cube by damage I mean you've been doing
this<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.539> few<00:01:56.990> years<00:01:57.380> now<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.710> it's<00:01:57.860> not

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
this for a few years now and it's not

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.499 
this for a few years now and it's not
dumb<00:01:58.430> luck<00:01:58.640> either<00:01:58.850> I<00:01:59.000> mean<00:01:59.180> you're<00:01:59.330> studying

dumb luck either I mean you're studying

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.090 
dumb luck either I mean you're studying
algorithms<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.500> course<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.830> get<00:02:00.950> to

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
algorithms and of course you get to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.620 
algorithms and of course you get to
recognize<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.670> patterns<00:02:02.030> yes<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.509> what's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
recognize the patterns yes and what's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.080 
recognize the patterns yes and what's
your<00:02:02.780> personal<00:02:03.140> best<00:02:03.319> for<00:02:03.970> just<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.060> regular
