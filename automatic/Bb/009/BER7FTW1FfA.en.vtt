transistor I have another jewel thief
and<00:00:51.449> I'll<00:00:51.839> show<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.109> that<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.409> a<00:00:52.530> moment<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and I'll show you that in a moment that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.090 
and I'll show you that in a moment that
one<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.030> not<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:55.109> one<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.409> actually<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
one does not that one is actually a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
one does not that one is actually a
pulse<00:00:56.550> generator<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.359> jewel<00:00:57.749> thief<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> the

next one but this is a real jewel thief

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.210 
next one but this is a real jewel thief
it's<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:01.069> I've<00:01:02.069> got<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> memory<00:01:03.199> capacitor

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
it's got I've got a memory capacitor

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.490 
it's got I've got a memory capacitor
across<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.700> battery<00:01:05.940> well<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
across the battery well you know the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.050 
across the battery well you know the
earth<00:01:08.100> battery<00:01:08.550> leads<00:01:08.870> and<00:01:09.870> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.440> germanium

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
earth battery leads and it's a germanium

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.990 
earth battery leads and it's a germanium
transistor<00:01:12.470> but<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.740> found<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.190> that's<00:01:14.760> not

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
transistor but as I found out that's not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
transistor but as I found out that's not
necessary<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.320> take<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.920> has<00:01:17.070> been

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
necessary but take a look this has been

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
necessary but take a look this has been
on<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:18.800> let's<00:01:19.800> see<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.850> 72<00:01:21.480> hours

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
on for let's see it was 72 hours

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.830 
on for let's see it was 72 hours
yesterday<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.040> getting<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> be

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
yesterday so it's now getting to be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.290 
yesterday so it's now getting to be
close<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:25.080> hundred<00:01:25.260> hours<00:01:28.520> 90<00:01:29.520> hours<00:01:29.670> let's

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
close to a hundred hours 90 hours let's

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.450 
close to a hundred hours 90 hours let's
call<00:01:30.510> it<00:01:30.630> 90<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> safe<00:01:31.980> side<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
call it 90 be on the safe side but it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.390 
call it 90 be on the safe side but it
has<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:33.180> hasn't<00:01:33.540> changed<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:35.280> you're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
has it hasn't changed at all what you're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010 
has it hasn't changed at all what you're
also<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.910> looking<00:01:36.330> at<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> brightness<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
also not looking at the brightness of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.500 
also not looking at the brightness of
the<00:01:37.080> light<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:39.240> full

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
the light it's really it's full

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.330 
the light it's really it's full
brightness<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.440> regular<00:01:40.590> jewel

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
brightness it's just a regular jewel

thief running off this plant okay bye so
here<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.280> same<00:01:53.940> plant<00:01:54.540> battery<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.290> running

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
here this same plant battery is running

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.460 
here this same plant battery is running
a<00:01:55.980> jewel<00:01:56.970> thief<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> secondary<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.350> I've

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
a jewel thief or the secondary now I've

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.020 
a jewel thief or the secondary now I've
always<00:01:58.560> called<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> jewel<00:01:59.520> thief<00:01:59.550> or<00:01:59.940> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
always called it a jewel thief or the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.000 
always called it a jewel thief or the
secondary<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.930> fact<00:02:01.230> this<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:01.680> two

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
secondary in fact this one has two

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.400 
secondary in fact this one has two
secondaries<00:02:02.730> I<00:02:02.970> ran<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> room<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.260> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
secondaries I ran out of room on the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.490 
secondaries I ran out of room on the
toroid<00:02:04.800> so<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.430> had<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.000> redesign<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:07.170> jewel

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
toroid so I had to redesign my jewel

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
toroid so I had to redesign my jewel
thief<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.980> put<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.489> aside<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
thief so I put this one aside that's the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.050 
thief so I put this one aside that's the
only<00:02:09.989> reason<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.739> particular<00:02:11.370> jewel

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
only reason I have this particular jewel

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.880 
only reason I have this particular jewel
thief<00:02:12.269> available<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.579> was<00:02:14.700> there

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
thief available but it was there

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.600 
thief available but it was there
uh<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.610> has<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.790> two<00:02:17.630> separate

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
uh but it has to two separate

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.710 
uh but it has to two separate
secondaries<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.240> one<00:02:20.420> light<00:02:20.569> is

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
secondaries and you can see one light is

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120 
secondaries and you can see one light is
brighter<00:02:20.990> than<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.350> other<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.620> that's<00:02:21.830> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
brighter than the other and that's the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
brighter than the other and that's the
function<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.790> how<00:02:23.090> many<00:02:23.270> times<00:02:23.870> i<00:02:24.050> turned<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
function of how many times i turned the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.650 
function of how many times i turned the
wires<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.569> each<00:02:26.720> secondary<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.240> this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
wires for each secondary so this is this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.050 
wires for each secondary so this is this
is<00:02:29.840> attached<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> same<00:02:31.040> place<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
is attached in the same place to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.780 
is attached in the same place to
magnesium<00:02:32.720> ribbon<00:02:33.490> over<00:02:34.490> here<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.930> copper

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
magnesium ribbon over here the copper
