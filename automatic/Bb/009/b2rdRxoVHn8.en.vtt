00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.680
I'm going to teach you how to make scars using
a product called rigid

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.590
collodion.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.510
It looks like this and it's from a company
named Kryolan.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.680
And,
you can get it at Halloween supply stores

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.689
and professional specialty make
up stores, such as Alcone in New York City.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.020
Or, you can also get it at the
Make-Up Designery.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.579
So basically what this is, is a product that
pulls the skin together.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.280
So,
it's pretty chemically.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.590
It smells a little bit like nail polish.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.969
If you
have super sensitive skin, I recommend not

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:43.969
using this.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.269
But, if you don't
have super sensitive skin, like Mico, we can

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:49.269
use it.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.460
So basically what's going to happen is, I'm
going to brush this on and I'm

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.019
going to have him pull his face taught.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.019
Like that.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.160
Can you do that for me
with both hands?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.160
Perfect.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.430
And, I'm going to make a Jokeresque scar,
kind

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.760
of like, Keith Ledger's scar in Batman.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.210
So, I have a little bit and I'm just going
to apply that here in the shape that I want.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.890
Can I have you move your fingers back off
your face a little bit, a little more.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.130
It dries pretty quick and the more layers
you add, the more severe the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.050
scarring will be.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.170
This you definitely don't want to get it in
your mouth,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.329
but I'm going to put it right up to the lip
to create that effect.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.700
Okay, we're going to do this on both sides,
but we're going to let this side dry

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.700
first.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.380
And, it's going to take, maybe, two to three
minutes.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.640
So, the scar should be a little shiny, usually
scars are.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.440
But, I'm going
to powder this one down just a little bit.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.840
So, I have powder on my powder
brush and I'm just going to tap it out on

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.050
both sides.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.720
And there we have
the start of the Joker scar.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.410
If you use rigid collodion, you can make very
subtle scars on pretty much

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.550
any part of the body.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.830
Especially arms.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.600
It's good for arms.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300
Depending on
what brush you use and how much you apply,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.500
you can get very real looking
scars.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.931
If you want to add a little bit of pinkish
color underneath it, you

00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:42.130
can start with a little bit of make-up underneath,
very, very, light, and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.780
subtle, and add that on top for a variation.
