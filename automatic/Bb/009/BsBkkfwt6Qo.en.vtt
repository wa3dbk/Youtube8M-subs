of<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.030> getting<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.450> hard<00:01:42.899> feeling<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
of just getting that hard feeling and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
of just getting that hard feeling and
I've<00:01:44.189> only<00:01:44.369> ever<00:01:44.460> used<00:01:44.850> them<00:01:45.030> once<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.540> did<00:01:46.140> wash

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I've only ever used them once I did wash

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.990 
I've only ever used them once I did wash
them<00:01:46.619> before<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.950> did<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.820> because

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
them before I did use them just because

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
them before I did use them just because
they<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> plasticky<00:01:49.079> coating<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.619> them

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
they have that plasticky coating on them
just<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> they<00:01:50.670> look<00:01:50.850> super<00:01:51.210> shiny
