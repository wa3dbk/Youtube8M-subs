00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.760
 karin any case with regard to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 totally unexpected accessories for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 tablet and phone and we start with 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 the house with a second 8 inch screen 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.930
 with a second screen why close 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.250
 because we all like to personalize our 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.019
 mobile phones including 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 name covers that are matched to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.840
 noosa nono notice our way of dressing 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.070
 look at this foam that is a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.239
 second screen that lets you go 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 much further since we can put 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.540
 the image we want we can even do 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.129
 photos and have it directly to 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 the back of his mobile phone 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.160
 it's even better than the wallpaper 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 and except that as it was technology of 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.309
 meaning that is to say ink 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.570
 electronic the same ink that is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.539
 used in electronic reading lights 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.739
 reading lights that exists today 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.180
 well they consume very little 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 of energy that allows like that to have in 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 constantly his notes give even 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.690
 books cards all notifications 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 that we receive instead of using 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.289
 the lcd screen that consume him from the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.969
 battery well the ink screen 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.930
 electronic moon we do not eat and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.460
 so we can have like that all these 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.200
 notifications all these notes all his 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 shopping list directly behind 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.530
 his phone no it's pretty cool 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 other accessories that I doubt a little 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.619
 under the portico for tablets 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.670
 I doubt you because you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.159
 did not have this experience 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 traumatic who is we in a bed 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.150
 we want to watch his tablet in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.439
 the combine and the tablet it falls to you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 on top you do not know how she 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.200
 bring so is what we have and we have mounted 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 this kind of porticos that feels a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 little to children's arousal games except 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 that it is an adult who is below 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.750
 of the portico 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 he hangs the tablet attal is in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.000
 levitation somewhere above the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.860
 nobody 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.299
 we do not even have to keep it with 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.430
 these access arms so we do not get tired 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.720
 the more hands she holds all alone and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.970
 we can like watching movies 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 in bed this without needing to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.329
 hold on to put cushions this is a 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.399
 very traumatic experience for 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.810
 people to be forced to tinker for 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.030
 plug in his phone so his 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.020
 tablet in the ricoh just link and 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 Besides, it can be a trauma 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 more convenient a bag that recharges these 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.840
 electronic gadgets sometimes hurt all 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.610
 dream because we always have a gadget 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.899
 electronics to more autonomy case more 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.100
 battery so it's great 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.420
 to have it like this one a bag 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.979
 normal we can make his computer 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.049
 portable inside except that when we 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.160
 louvre to the darija full of cables all 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.289
 these cables are used for what purpose to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.910
 recharge the tablet to recharge the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.590
 phone because actually this 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.300
 who seems to agree a kilo he has 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.950
 a big battery inside this 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.560
 big battery can charge 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.690
 it's his phone his tablet and even 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.790
 watch and even his laptop 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.930
 via a small little plug like that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.100
 they are like in the vacuum cleaners 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.990
 and you can plug in his computer 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.160
 portable and charging power is rare 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 of course it can be a little heavier 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.680
 it is then but what is it like 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.420
 additional autonomy it's 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.590
 great for those who leave 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.880
 journalists who are on the ground who 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.260
 need autonomy that have little 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 serge rsa kormann battery 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.290
 you have to recharge the sacb there is a 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.690
 little application to know if we have 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.270
 reload the bag before leaving 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.270
 displacement canton and genlis for example 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:58.610
 in addition it is a ladle on and ipad 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.610
 attacks on the physical because it has me 2011 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.520
 yes the pregnant cover so where his 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.110
 meaning what is it is a 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.550
 accessory that is very useful for everyone 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.410
 those who use their tablet as 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.310
 chain hifi the shelves problem 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.870
 today is that they have everything 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.890
 little speakers so that can not 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.450
 sonorized a house so this is it 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.770
 what did my general age do we buy a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.390
 accessory that are not speakers 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.100
 in which we connect the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.240
 tablet and that gives a big sound and 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.240
 well someone has an idea to put some 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.590
 pregnant around the tablet 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.670
 and when we have elders all around 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.860
 the table what does it give karine 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.750
 it gives ten years of sound we come from very 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.550
 good it gives a drop is accessory 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.780
 which is interesting is that we can 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.250
 no longer needs to have a speaker 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.920
 external the tablet becomes a speaker 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.670
 all alone because he loses his charisma 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.670
 to charisma thank you very much and who knows
