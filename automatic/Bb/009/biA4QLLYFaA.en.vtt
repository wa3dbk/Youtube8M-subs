00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.969
 he just shows me that 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.310
 paravan project the way I like it 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.920
 have presented from the beginning that is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.380
 a cool action is in his today 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.950
 video his opinion about 6 was in fact 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.270
 eg 1 comment under chimpanzee I like 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.159
 they are much better than commander 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.380
 Rieger is of course the ass occurs for 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.630
 but that's exactly what it's about 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.980
 i want you on my channel yes 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.480
 present cool people or permanently 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.610
 the cool people I want 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.250
 of course, offer a platform over the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
 you get more attention where you are 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.890
 maybe even have the possibility 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.930
 to do the whole with full-time 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.400
 not with your channel but over 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.629
 my channel because of my channel 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.450
 Of course, guys also deserve it 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.860
 little money 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.140
 and you have the advantage that you are on 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.849
 collectors could know this is a job 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.099
 other video I like so much market and 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.000
 that's the stupid old commander in gar 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.069
 can not stand anymore 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.180
 I watch the tank video so am 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.580
 collection below right in the corner 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.530
 recognizes her about the whole and that's 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 champagne actually showed me that way 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.550
 and the comments below the job others 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.769
 video have indeed shown me that the idea 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.500
 by jörg rieger spa are waiting for something 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.880
 is reasonable and that I keep it up 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.560
 must stick to every case because as well 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.500
 jimmy is right now doing what I call 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.269
 I love it jimmy 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.160
 me the palawan project always and always 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.260
 just as it was my wish 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.750
 and of course now came after 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.790
 jimmy his opinion video about six 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.079
 of course came out, too 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.640
 now a few people to me and has 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.560
 told 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 commander how are your opinion about in 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.000
 his text and yes, how can I sometimes 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.720
 just cut out 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.220
 In principle I even have 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480
 no problem with them not only 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.890
 basically I do not have any 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.349
 problem with that i come the eu very much 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.690
 well and there is nothing between us 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.849
 Of course, and unfortunately I can 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.349
 He would have said that as a padawan 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.200
 meanwhile a bit more effort 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.459
 you can and you see right now 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.230
 Anja panse like me the whole 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.489
 that 's what I said 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.650
 expected a bit 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.600
 because Jim really does that 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.200
 excellence else I can unfortunately 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 do not say 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.010
 and I think that's very cool and that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.560
 I think that's very cool and I think that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.420
 the gym also a bit of the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.569
 The trigger was that texts to the small 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.519
 Ass kicked off and off 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.359
 Immediately the d sentix a little bit more 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.609
 will strain 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.440
 He now sees where the journey goes and 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.910
 he will get from me anyway 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.769
 a chance as I said each of his 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.650
 Good luck with what you can do with the opportunities 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.239
 make that is a left to yourself and 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.459
 I'm not anybody right now 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.010
 Knebelverträge raushaut and said 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.630
 sometimes you have at least 834 videos 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.760
 upload to my kölner every year 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.470
 otherwise you're shit do something 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.419
 Not only when he says he wants 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.070
 videos are good that's good for him 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.229
 that for me it's good for you 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.830
 Well, that's good for everyone 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:30.620
 and that's what it's about and nothing else 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.849
 and I assume there too 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.280
 again the screaming starts 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.409
 how do you get kriegers palawan and 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.210
 then it starts again I go 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.240
 of it 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.180
 the end of september will give the paravan 3.0 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.069
 will or the parliament 3.0 tournament 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.870
 that is the third round of paravan 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.970
 Project where the third paravan wanted 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.270
 it will be a total I guess 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.750
 it will leave five maximum of six paravent 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.240
 give 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.770
 so, how much is ultimately his 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.880
 is so I can not say but 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.080
 I guess it will be like that and it 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.150
 is now in any case with the number 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.400
 three going on and when we found number 3 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.360
 then we have the rempler first 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.009
 a little break 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 so that people first time so 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.190
 can acclimatize a bit 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.919
 and I think that's easy 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.320
 just more than okay so everyone 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.880
 case what will share avant 3.0 look like 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.620
 how many people will participate 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.289
 What are the tasks 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.880
 I can tell you all that 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.470
 we still think I will of course 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.280
 also with semtex and chimpanzee 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.490
 chat over it 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.000
 whether to leave 432 people or 16 people too 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.720
 to let 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.190
 It will be back via an application video 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.990
 the people will be chosen by 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.340
 us we do have is ultimately 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.900
 to work together for the people 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.780
 and if so, let me just say 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.270
 anyone can come purple can daniela 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.289
 then of course shit but I have to 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.909
 with the people finally 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.470
 mainly work together 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.409
 and if as somebody is on the 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.580
 not even not at all clear get there 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.530
 will not participate because no 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.990
 hottest application video how to do 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.139
 only there is for the personal nose the 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.639
 pattern otherwise you agree with what you see 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.280
 Upload the gym and you can 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.139
 Set that up a bit too 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.229
 means if you do not have so much time 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:14.180
 to produce as many videos 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.590
 then you should do a little bit better 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.539
 you have to be more careful so yes 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:22.909
 unfortunately frankly formulate and he say yes 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.830
 I'd rather wait a bit longer 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.169
 that should already be so 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.729
 maybe scale of things 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:29.479
 a little bit less, but maybe 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.250
 also a little bit more 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.340
 that's just up to you but up 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.620
 in any case, not too little with it 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.719
 synonymous content complies so that's one 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.729
 little of the claim of the whole 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.130
 and as I said, that's just mine 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.289
 personal thanksgiving video engine 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.020
 armor and the drops is here too 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.210
 Yes 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.620
 Partially it sucked was somehow 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.020
 a bit longer I hope that with me 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.400
 licked and not with you 40 to 4 is 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.900
 the drops went out 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 Thanks a lot to the capsule of the election 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.979
 not the first time here with me on the 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.300
 always gladly always 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.310
 happy again and I say goodbye 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.900
 now with a good shot or 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.080
 commander warriors until next time 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.080
 bye
