00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
see these cross beams here they're all

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.460 
see these cross beams here they're all
crumbling<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.620> falling<00:05:28.680> apart<00:05:30.470> it's

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
crumbling and falling apart it's

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.210 
crumbling and falling apart it's
freaking<00:05:31.919> crazy<00:05:33.590> but<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.740> absolutely<00:05:35.159> we

and<00:05:42.449> what's<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.750> point<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.020> having<00:05:43.139> a<00:05:43.349> tunnel

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
and what's the point of having a tunnel

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.860 
and what's the point of having a tunnel
if<00:05:44.849> you're<00:05:45.060> not<00:05:45.120> going<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.330> maintaining<00:05:45.690> I

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
if you're not going to maintaining I

in

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.570 

as<00:05:58.320> you<00:05:58.470> can<00:05:58.530> see<00:05:58.710> this<00:05:58.950> side<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.400> tunnel

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
as you can see this side of the tunnel

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.780 
as you can see this side of the tunnel
is<00:05:59.820> where<00:06:00.510> shaped<00:06:00.870> on<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.200> other<00:06:01.320> side<00:06:01.790> even

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
is where shaped on the other side even

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.030 
is where shaped on the other side even
bigger<00:06:03.060> sections<00:06:03.570> of<00:06:03.720> panels<00:06:04.170> missing

bigger sections of panels missing

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.890 
bigger sections of panels missing
because<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:06.090> mean<00:06:06.210> I<00:06:06.270> know<00:06:06.420> there's<00:06:06.660> concrete

because I mean I know there's concrete

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.880 
because I mean I know there's concrete
and<00:06:07.410> behind<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:08.040> but<00:06:08.250> still<00:06:08.580> just<00:06:09.890> looks

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
and behind it but still just looks

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:19.670 
and behind it but still just looks
really<00:06:11.220> really<00:06:11.520> really<00:06:11.700> bad

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.379 

yeah<00:06:20.280> of<00:06:20.400> course<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:20.789> tunnel<00:06:21.090> you<00:06:21.180> got<00:06:21.300> to

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
yeah of course with tunnel you got to

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.029 
yeah of course with tunnel you got to
run<00:06:21.509> the<00:06:21.630> middle<00:06:21.870> lane<00:06:22.020> for<00:06:22.380> trucks<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.949> as

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
run the middle lane for trucks and as

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.499 
run the middle lane for trucks and as
soon<00:06:23.220> as<00:06:23.310> we<00:06:23.400> get<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.759> other<00:06:23.820> side<00:06:24.090> we<00:06:24.360> got

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
soon as we get to the other side we got

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.360 
soon as we get to the other side we got
to<00:06:24.600> get<00:06:24.690> over<00:06:24.780> into<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.080> right<00:06:25.199> lane<00:06:25.440> luckily

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
to get over into the right lane luckily

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.800 
to get over into the right lane luckily
is<00:06:26.580> not<00:06:26.759> super<00:06:27.150> heavy<00:06:27.389> traffic<00:06:27.810> today

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
is not super heavy traffic today

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.490 
is not super heavy traffic today
otherwise<00:06:30.810> you<00:06:30.960> usually<00:06:31.110> gets<00:06:31.440> pretty

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
otherwise you usually gets pretty

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.029 
otherwise you usually gets pretty
difficult<00:06:31.889> to<00:06:32.250> get<00:06:32.370> over<00:06:33.530> we<00:06:34.530> got<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:34.770> take<00:06:34.919> the

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
difficult to get over we got to take the

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.409 
difficult to get over we got to take the
2nd<00:06:35.460> exit<00:06:35.520> that<00:06:35.880> we<00:06:35.970> come<00:06:36.120> out<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.330> the<00:06:36.389> tunnel

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
2nd exit that we come out of the tunnel

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:48.100 
2nd exit that we come out of the tunnel
here<00:06:36.870> on
