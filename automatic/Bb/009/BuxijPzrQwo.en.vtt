touched on already that Evelyn not

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.290 
touched on already that Evelyn not
making<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> impact<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.590> them<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.160> kind<00:00:12.120> of

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
making the impact at them it's kind of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.150 
making the impact at them it's kind of
it<00:00:12.750> would<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.230> able<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.679> do<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.130> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
it would be able to do and it was a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.530 
it would be able to do and it was a
first<00:00:14.460> pic<00:00:14.639> first<00:00:14.670> lock<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.389> immediately

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
first pic first lock and you immediately

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.599 
first pic first lock and you immediately
said<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.410> something<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:17.460> would

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
said that is not something that we would

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.570 
said that is not something that we would
do<00:00:17.850> why<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:19.350> first<00:00:20.250> picking

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
do why is that I think first picking

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.830 
do why is that I think first picking
evident<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> good<00:00:21.420> option<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.779> be

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
evident is not a good option to be

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960 
evident is not a good option to be
honest<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.949> many<00:00:23.100> pigs<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.910> were

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
honest there was so many pigs that were

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.089 
honest there was so many pigs that were
better<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.199> even<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.890> first

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
better and I think even the first

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.730 
better and I think even the first
preclusion<00:00:26.430> would<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.849> been<00:00:26.939> better<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
preclusion would have been better and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.230 
preclusion would have been better and
the<00:00:28.740> fact<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.490> IP<00:00:29.609> didn't<00:00:29.939> take<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> in

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the fact that and IP didn't take it in

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.150 
the fact that and IP didn't take it in
the<00:00:30.300> first<00:00:30.480> rotation<00:00:31.050> told<00:00:31.560> me<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.949> they

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the first rotation told me that they

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.590 
the first rotation told me that they
actually<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> play<00:00:32.910> against<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.329> because

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually want to play against it because

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.790 
actually want to play against it because
there<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.930> no<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.530> will<00:00:34.680> leave

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there was no way that they will leave

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.080 
there was no way that they will leave
Lucien<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> Leona<00:00:37.200> kinda<00:00:38.090> yeah

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
Lucien of them and the Leona kinda yeah

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
Lucien of them and the Leona kinda yeah
they<00:00:39.360> also<00:00:39.510> locked<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> Jena<00:00:40.140> against<00:00:40.770> Leona

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
they also locked in Jena against Leona

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.440 
they also locked in Jena against Leona
and<00:00:41.190> expected<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.820> two<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.090> two<00:00:42.239> lanes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and expected to go two on two lanes

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.889 
and expected to go two on two lanes
which<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.530> disagree<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:44.870> yeah<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
which I really disagree with yeah I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.639 
which I really disagree with yeah I
think<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.260> should<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.440> picked

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
think they should have picked

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
think they should have picked
differently<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.789> our<00:00:47.910> picks<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
differently and they got our picks and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.650 
differently and they got our picks and
our<00:00:49.410> class<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> whole<00:00:50.219> game<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.239> talking

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
our class in the whole game and talking

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
our class in the whole game and talking
to<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> two<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:52.410> lines<00:00:52.590> obviously<00:00:52.949> but

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
to the two in two lines obviously but

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
to the two in two lines obviously but
they<00:00:53.219> went<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> 40<00:00:53.850> split<00:00:54.690> Porsche<00:00:55.020> which

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
they went for the 40 split Porsche which

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.340 
they went for the 40 split Porsche which
we've<00:00:55.500> seen<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.219> commonly<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.030> he<00:00:57.930> spotted<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
we've seen so commonly but he spotted a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
we've seen so commonly but he spotted a
mistake<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:01:00.210> both<00:01:00.420> teams<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:01.350> miss

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
mistake I think both teams actually miss

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.250 
mistake I think both teams actually miss
played<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.250> oral<00:01:03.180> 0<00:01:03.329> suen<00:01:03.510> ftp<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> he

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
played it as oral 0 suen ftp that he

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.509 
played it as oral 0 suen ftp that he
could<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.409> died<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.189> valium

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
could have died there like if valium

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.760 
could have died there like if valium
would<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.420> done<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> right<00:01:07.080> choice<00:01:07.320> they

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
would have done the right choice they

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.660 
would have done the right choice they
would<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.979> drove<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> him<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.460> he<00:01:08.520> would

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
would have drove in him and he would

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340 
would have drove in him and he would
have<00:01:08.760> died<00:01:08.880> even<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.420> spare<00:01:09.600> shop<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> being

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
have died even with spare shop and being

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.240 
have died even with spare shop and being
a<00:01:10.409> mondo<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.520> also<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> same<00:01:12.270> time

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
a mondo but also think at the same time

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
a mondo but also think at the same time
like<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.460> refer<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> c9<00:01:15.900> push

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
like we refer to it as like the c9 push

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.510 
like we refer to it as like the c9 push
where<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> second<00:01:17.400> wave

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
where you just put on the second wave

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.249 
where you just put on the second wave
instead<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.060> third<00:01:18.210> wave<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:19.020> gives

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
instead of the third wave which gives

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
instead of the third wave which gives
you<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.740> advantage<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you like the advantage and you just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.249 
you like the advantage and you just
stick<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.270> jungler<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.869> take<00:01:22.080> one

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
stick as a jungler you only take one

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
stick as a jungler you only take one
buff<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.680> leave<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> other<00:01:23.700> buff<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
buff and leave the other buff that you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.820 
buff and leave the other buff that you
have<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.869> journal<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.650> five

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
have in your journal for like five

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.140 
have in your journal for like five
minute<00:01:26.159> mark<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:26.970> come

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
minute mark or something and then come

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.390 
minute mark or something and then come
back<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.979> way<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> don't

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
back and get it but that way you don't

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
back and get it but that way you don't
waste<00:01:29.610> any<00:01:29.759> time<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.600> leather<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
waste any time you get leather to on

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
waste any time you get leather to on
both<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.439> jungler<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.220> top<00:01:32.670> lane<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.060> then

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
both your jungler and top lane and then

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.469 
both your jungler and top lane and then
you<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.560> 40<00:01:34.799> push<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.479> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you just go for the 40 push so it's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
you just go for the 40 push so it's
really<00:01:36.869> effective<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.890> win<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.340> one

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
really effective and you win like one

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.890 
really effective and you win like one
minute<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.909> something<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> win<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> base

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
minute or something and win the base

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
minute or something and win the base
race<00:01:40.170> even<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.590> purpose<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> do

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
race even on purpose like when you do

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.609 
race even on purpose like when you do
that<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.299> even<00:01:42.659> without<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.470> way

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that so even without going that way

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109 
that so even without going that way
let's<00:01:43.860> let's<00:01:44.130> expand<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
let's let's expand on that on the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
let's let's expand on that on the
junglers<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> said<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> Evelyn

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
junglers because as you said the Evelyn

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
junglers because as you said the Evelyn
and<00:01:46.649> take<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.640> best<00:01:47.909> pick<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> first

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and take not that best pick as a first

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
and take not that best pick as a first
pick<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> effluent<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> other

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pick and in the effluent on the other

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
pick and in the effluent on the other
side<00:01:49.799> how<00:01:50.369> impressed<00:01:50.909> were<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.090> with

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
side how impressed were you with

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
side how impressed were you with
gilberto<00:01:52.170> skills<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> Elise<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.280> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
gilberto skills on that Elise in this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.510 
gilberto skills on that Elise in this
game<00:01:53.579> um<00:01:54.149> yeah<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.740> went<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> cooler

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
game um yeah he actually went the cooler

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
game um yeah he actually went the cooler
reduction<00:01:57.000> build<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> e<00:01:57.719> second<00:01:58.350> max

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
reduction build with the e second max

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
reduction build with the e second max
which<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> pretty<00:01:59.310> good<00:01:59.430> right<00:01:59.670> now<00:01:59.700> because

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
which is pretty good right now because

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.420 
which is pretty good right now because
um<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.990> meteors<00:02:01.469> was<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.770> first<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.219> who

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
um I think meteors was the first one who

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
um I think meteors was the first one who
played<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.939> showed<00:02:03.509> everyone<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.899> is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
played it and showed everyone that is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
played it and showed everyone that is
really<00:02:04.409> effective<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.460> lucidity<00:02:06.270> boot<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
really effective so lucidity boot on a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
really effective so lucidity boot on a
lease<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.290> good<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.220> think<00:02:08.610> even

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
lease are really good and I think even

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.490 
lease are really good and I think even
when<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> matchup<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.810> bad<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> early<00:02:10.319> game

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
when the matchup is bad the early game

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.330 
when the matchup is bad the early game
for<00:02:11.039> Elise

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
for Elise

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.610 
for Elise
didn't<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.700> anything<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:14.230> least<00:02:14.410> could

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
didn't do anything so at least could

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.910 
didn't do anything so at least could
just<00:02:14.830> firm<00:02:15.069> up<00:02:15.280> get<00:02:15.910> levels<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.830> after<00:02:17.830> like

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
just firm up get levels and after like

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.800 
just firm up get levels and after like
they<00:02:18.040> were<00:02:18.129> 13<00:02:18.459> when<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> East<00:02:18.910> mixed<00:02:19.330> it's

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
they were 13 when the East mixed it's

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.229 
they were 13 when the East mixed it's
like<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> two<00:02:20.110> second<00:02:20.470> stun<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.890> they<00:02:21.640> alter<00:02:21.940> TF

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
like a two second stun and they alter TF

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.460 
like a two second stun and they alter TF
were<00:02:22.420> just<00:02:22.569> like<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> two-second<00:02:23.200> stunter<00:02:23.440> 13

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
were just like a two-second stunter 13

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.559 
were just like a two-second stunter 13
so<00:02:24.069> they<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.610> change<00:02:24.790> CC<00:02:25.180> pretty<00:02:25.390> much

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
so they can just change CC pretty much

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.470 
so they can just change CC pretty much
forever<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.500> really<00:02:27.069> like<00:02:27.190> TF<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
forever so I really like TF and the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.390 
forever so I really like TF and the
least<00:02:28.660> together<00:02:28.900> which<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.170> pretty<00:02:29.860> good<00:02:30.099> so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
least together which is pretty good so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.640 
least together which is pretty good so
yeah<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.330> like<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:31.750> item<00:02:31.900> build<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.260> yeah<00:02:32.620> I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
yeah I like the item build it up yeah I

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.050 
yeah I like the item build it up yeah I
mean<00:02:32.799> obviously<00:02:32.920> they're<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.700> global

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
mean obviously they're the the global

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.970 
mean obviously they're the the global
gold<00:02:34.269> stacks<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.870> driving<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.709> along

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
gold stacks the driving in there along

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.650 
gold stacks the driving in there along
with<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.190> twisted<00:02:36.370> fate<00:02:36.730> would<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.360> make<00:02:37.510> it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
with the twisted fate would you make it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.910 
with the twisted fate would you make it
that<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> twisty<00:02:38.110> pay<00:02:38.230> up<00:02:38.379> against<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> car

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
that the twisty pay up against the car

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.680 
that the twisty pay up against the car
thurs<00:02:39.129> do<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.310> think<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.760> curb<00:02:40.120> maybe<00:02:40.480> could

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thurs do you think the curb maybe could

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.729 
thurs do you think the curb maybe could
have<00:02:40.750> pulled<00:02:40.930> something<00:02:41.049> better<00:02:41.470> than<00:02:41.709> a

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
have pulled something better than a

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.750 
have pulled something better than a
Karthus<00:02:42.549> out<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.430> fact

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
Karthus out there I think was the fact

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.420 
Karthus out there I think was the fact
that<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.390> pick<00:02:46.870> Jenna<00:02:47.079> that<00:02:47.319> early<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.739> think

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
that I pick Jenna that early I think

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.920 
that I pick Jenna that early I think
Soraka<00:02:48.730> had<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.090> better<00:02:49.299> impact<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:49.840> I'm

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
Soraka had a better impact and I'm

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.750 
Soraka had a better impact and I'm
pretty<00:02:50.170> surprised<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.860> no<00:02:51.010> ones<00:02:51.190> were<00:02:51.370> like

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
pretty surprised that no ones were like

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
pretty surprised that no ones were like
no<00:02:52.180> one<00:02:52.299> was<00:02:52.390> picking<00:02:52.510> Soraka<00:02:53.019> she<00:02:53.650> has<00:02:53.769> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
no one was picking Soraka she has the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
no one was picking Soraka she has the
same<00:02:54.130> impact<00:02:54.459> she<00:02:55.420> has<00:02:55.569> better<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.829> if<00:02:57.549> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
same impact she has better like if you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.670 
same impact she has better like if you
heal<00:02:58.239> it's<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.629> same<00:02:58.810> as<00:02:58.840> taking<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.650> you

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
heal it's the same as taking like you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.770 
heal it's the same as taking like you
mitigate<00:03:00.190> damage<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.730> know<00:03:00.760> yeah<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.390> we<00:03:01.629> say

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
mitigate damage you know yeah and we say

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.869 
mitigate damage you know yeah and we say
Jenna<00:03:01.959> together<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.560> has<00:03:02.590> more<00:03:02.920> sense<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.610> it

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
Jenna together it has more sense like it

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.640 
Jenna together it has more sense like it
makes<00:03:04.030> more<00:03:04.329> sense<00:03:04.390> because<00:03:04.780> they<00:03:05.290> had<00:03:05.440> no

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
makes more sense because they had no

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.289 
makes more sense because they had no
killed<00:03:05.890> pressure<00:03:06.129> on<00:03:06.430> both<00:03:06.819> lines<00:03:07.030> like

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
killed pressure on both lines like

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.699 
killed pressure on both lines like
Savannah<00:03:07.629> doesn't<00:03:07.930> kill<00:03:08.049> anyone<00:03:08.079> on<00:03:08.590> their

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
Savannah doesn't kill anyone on their

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.300 
Savannah doesn't kill anyone on their
own<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:10.299> Jenna<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.200> Lucien<00:03:12.190> line

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
own and the Jenna and Lucien line

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.430 
own and the Jenna and Lucien line
doesn't<00:03:12.489> kill<00:03:12.730> one<00:03:12.879> either<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.690> think<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
doesn't kill one either so I think the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.960 
doesn't kill one either so I think the
car<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.739> was<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.890> really<00:03:15.069> miss<00:03:15.310> big<00:03:15.489> steak<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
car this was a really miss big steak and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.870 
car this was a really miss big steak and
a<00:03:16.420> TF<00:03:17.049> pick<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.950> even<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.370> blue<00:03:18.519> side<00:03:18.700> would

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
a TF pick on even on blue side would

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.000 
a TF pick on even on blue side would
have<00:03:18.970> been<00:03:19.120> better<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.380> best<00:03:20.590> option

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
have been better but the best option

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.800 
have been better but the best option
would<00:03:21.130> probably<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.549> Soraka<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:22.569> go<00:03:22.660> for

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
would probably be Soraka and just go for

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.809 
would probably be Soraka and just go for
teamfights<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.310> main<00:03:24.549> thing<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
teamfights so is that the main thing you

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.150 
teamfights so is that the main thing you
take<00:03:25.060> from<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.359> should<00:03:25.780> they<00:03:25.989> even<00:03:26.709> if<00:03:26.920> they

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
take from this should they even if they

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.650 
take from this should they even if they
don't<00:03:27.280> play<00:03:27.489> it<00:03:27.609> bandit<00:03:28.030> TF<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.420> take<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
don't play it bandit TF and take the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.030 
don't play it bandit TF and take the
Sirocco<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.230> what<00:03:29.440> were<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.650> other<00:03:29.769> lanes

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
Sirocco or what were the other lanes

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.470 
Sirocco or what were the other lanes
what<00:03:30.250> order<00:03:30.430> pics<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.910> kind<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.359> see

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
what order pics you kind of want to see

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.390 
what order pics you kind of want to see
coming<00:03:31.720> out<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:31.959> millennium<00:03:32.290> well<00:03:33.069> honestly

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
coming out for millennium well honestly

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.300 
coming out for millennium well honestly
I<00:03:33.700> think<00:03:34.019> TF<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.319> first<00:03:35.560> pic<00:03:35.769> or<00:03:36.099> band

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
I think TF is the first pic or band

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.870 
I think TF is the first pic or band
worthy<00:03:36.819> champion<00:03:37.000> again<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:38.220> even<00:03:39.220> i<00:03:39.489> sided

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
worthy champion again and even i sided

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.780 
worthy champion again and even i sided
at<00:03:40.000> tails<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.810> my<00:03:40.900> team<00:03:41.280> been<00:03:42.280> TF<00:03:42.549> maybe

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
at tails like to my team been TF maybe

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.000 
at tails like to my team been TF maybe
even<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.329> salon<00:03:43.540> plate<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.319> risk<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.829> hide

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
even the salon plate the risk is to hide

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.890 
even the salon plate the risk is to hide
that<00:03:45.280> they've<00:03:45.489> might<00:03:45.639> play<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.849> and<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.690> think

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
that they've might play it and I think

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.720 
that they've might play it and I think
he's<00:03:47.230> making<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.590> comeback<00:03:47.799> right<00:03:48.040> now<00:03:48.220> he<00:03:48.700> is

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
he's making a comeback right now he is

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
he's making a comeback right now he is
really<00:03:49.030> really<00:03:49.239> good<00:03:49.450> especially<00:03:49.989> with<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
really really good especially with the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.530 
really really good especially with the
new<00:03:50.680> items<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.609> lich<00:03:51.819> bane<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.389> bill

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
new items like the lich bane the bill

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.080 
new items like the lich bane the bill
part<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.900> better<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.669> he<00:03:54.669> doesn't<00:03:54.880> have<00:03:54.910> any

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
part is better and he doesn't have any

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.000 
part is better and he doesn't have any
bad<00:03:55.269> matchup<00:03:55.599> if<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:56.109> go<00:03:56.230> on<00:03:56.290> an<00:03:56.380> assassin<00:03:56.739> he

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
bad matchup if you go on an assassin he

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.949 
bad matchup if you go on an assassin he
just<00:03:57.220> takes<00:03:57.400> exhaust<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.090> gates<00:03:58.359> holder

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
just takes exhaust and the gates holder

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.349 
just takes exhaust and the gates holder
like<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.319> all<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.530> early<00:03:59.769> game<00:03:59.919> and<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:01.090> four

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
like to all the early game and the four

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.659 
like to all the early game and the four
push<00:04:01.599> for<00:04:02.440> men<00:04:02.560> push<00:04:02.739> really<00:04:03.040> favors<00:04:03.370> him<00:04:03.489> too

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
push for men push really favors him too

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.430 
push for men push really favors him too
because<00:04:03.790> he<00:04:04.030> gets<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.239> free<00:04:04.359> lane<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
because he gets a free lane and the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.979 
because he gets a free lane and the
second<00:04:05.799> for<00:04:05.950> tows<00:04:06.130> are<00:04:06.280> down<00:04:06.340> like<00:04:06.760> TFS<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.599> free

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
second for tows are down like TFS a free

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.920 
second for tows are down like TFS a free
farm<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.410> free<00:04:08.590> roam<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.180> i<00:04:10.180> also<00:04:10.419> think<00:04:10.750> that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
farm and free roam and i also think that

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.800 
farm and free roam and i also think that
first<00:04:11.919> working<00:04:12.190> Evelyn<00:04:12.519> was<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.150> TF<00:04:13.419> open<00:04:13.690> is

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
first working Evelyn was the TF open is

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.809 
first working Evelyn was the TF open is
the<00:04:13.900> mistake<00:04:14.200> because<00:04:14.440> it's<00:04:14.769> negates<00:04:15.639> the

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
the mistake because it's negates the

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.360 
the mistake because it's negates the
stealth<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.389> share<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:17.680> obviously<00:04:17.950> rolling

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
stealth and share so obviously rolling

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.149 
stealth and share so obviously rolling
into<00:04:18.519> game<00:04:18.849> to<00:04:19.180> game<00:04:19.780> 1<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.139> said<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.560> lot<00:04:20.859> hinges

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
into game to game 1 we said a lot hinges

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.120 
into game to game 1 we said a lot hinges

on that do we CN IP now rolling through

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.190 
on that do we CN IP now rolling through

this one or Waka millennium do to make

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.460 
this one or Waka millennium do to make
turn<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.530> back<00:04:26.650> around<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.780> depends<00:04:29.200> if<00:04:29.410> they

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
turn it back around it depends if they

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.370 
turn it back around it depends if they
have<00:04:30.460> another<00:04:30.790> strategy<00:04:31.060> prepared<00:04:31.660> for<00:04:32.200> it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
have another strategy prepared for it

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.010 
have another strategy prepared for it
and<00:04:32.680> an<00:04:33.100> IPS<00:04:33.940> blue<00:04:34.120> side<00:04:34.330> right<00:04:34.510> now<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:34.990> I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
and an IPS blue side right now so I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.790 
and an IPS blue side right now so I
guess<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.650> expect<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:37.060> either<00:04:37.180> get<00:04:37.450> like<00:04:37.800> Lucien

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
guess I expect to either get like Lucien

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.500 
guess I expect to either get like Lucien
maybe<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.490> SEC<00:04:39.670> notation<00:04:40.120> or<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:40.360> leave

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
maybe on the SEC notation or they leave

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.000 
maybe on the SEC notation or they leave
