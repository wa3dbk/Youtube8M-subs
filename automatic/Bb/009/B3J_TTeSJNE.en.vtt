about<00:01:48.350> twenty<00:01:48.740> percent<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.220> their<00:01:49.340> operating

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
about twenty percent of their operating

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.060 
about twenty percent of their operating
profit<00:01:50.330> comes<00:01:50.570> from<00:01:50.750> watches<00:01:51.140> retailing

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
profit comes from watches retailing

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.920 
profit comes from watches retailing
below<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> thousand<00:01:52.909> dollars<00:01:53.270> that's<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
below a thousand dollars that's the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.600 
below a thousand dollars that's the
segment<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.440> could<00:01:54.619> be<00:01:54.710> cannibalized<00:01:55.250> by

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
segment that could be cannibalized by

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490 
segment that could be cannibalized by
the<00:01:56.000> Apple<00:01:56.300> watch<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:57.140> think<00:01:57.380> this

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
the Apple watch and I think this

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.200 
the Apple watch and I think this
initiative<00:01:58.070> they<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.729> development

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
initiative they have in the development

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.090 
initiative they have in the development
of<00:01:59.270> smartwatches<00:01:59.720> is<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.380> way<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> maintain

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
of smartwatches is a way to maintain

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.340 
of smartwatches is a way to maintain
market<00:02:01.670> share<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.869> think<00:02:03.229> what

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
market share and I think what

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.070 
market share and I think what
everybody's<00:02:03.800> hoping<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:04.280> an<00:02:04.399> Apple<00:02:04.700> watch

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
everybody's hoping is an Apple watch

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.840 
everybody's hoping is an Apple watch
develops<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.320> sort<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.619> whole<00:02:06.830> new<00:02:07.130> segment<00:02:07.700> of

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
develops a sort of whole new segment of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.820 
develops a sort of whole new segment of
the<00:02:08.060> watch<00:02:08.239> market<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.020> actually<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> Swiss

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the watch market and actually the Swiss

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.280 
the watch market and actually the Swiss
watchmakers<00:02:10.489> will<00:02:10.610> be<00:02:10.729> able<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.000> gain<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.660> yes

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
watchmakers will be able to gain so yes

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.530 
watchmakers will be able to gain so yes
I<00:02:12.440> think<00:02:12.620> in<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.100> first<00:02:13.310> instance<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
I think in the first instance there is a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.170 
I think in the first instance there is a
risk<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.050> them<00:02:15.560> losing<00:02:16.040> share<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.610> Apple<00:02:17.030> watch

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
risk of them losing share as Apple watch

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.090 
risk of them losing share as Apple watch
is<00:02:17.209> launched<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.019> end<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.470> end<00:02:18.709> of

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
is launched at the end of the end of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.370 
is launched at the end of the end of
April<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.780> over<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.080> sort<00:02:21.350> of

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
April but I think over the sort of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.440 
April but I think over the sort of
coming<00:02:21.680> months<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.100> quarters<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:23.239> could

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
coming months and quarters they could

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
coming months and quarters they could
actually<00:02:23.570> gain<00:02:23.959> share<00:02:24.290> if<00:02:24.590> this<00:02:24.830> market

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
actually gain share if this market

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.210 
actually gain share if this market
really<00:02:25.430> starts<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.910> take<00:02:26.180> off<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:27.260> NFC<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.010> not

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
really starts to take off the NFC is not

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.090 
really starts to take off the NFC is not
just<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.760> payment<00:02:29.480> way<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.290> pay<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.920> also

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
just a payment way to pay you can also

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.190 
just a payment way to pay you can also
use<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.580> for<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> key<00:02:32.300> lock<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.780> open<00:02:32.810> your

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
use it for as a key lock to open your

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.460 
use it for as a key lock to open your
car<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.430> build<00:02:35.030> loyalty<00:02:35.239> program<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.230> there's

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
car to build loyalty program so there's

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
car to build loyalty program so there's
a<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.680> more<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.160> than<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.430> making

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
a lot more to it than just making

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
a lot more to it than just making
payments<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.230> really<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.250> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
payments and really I think this is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.040 
payments and really I think this is
where<00:02:40.580> swatch<00:02:40.910> group<00:02:40.940> sees<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.569> future<00:02:41.690> of

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
where swatch group sees the future of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.600 
where swatch group sees the future of
the<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.590> Swiss<00:02:42.830> watch<00:02:43.040> industry<00:02:43.340> at

does<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.930> does<00:03:18.079> look<00:03:18.290> pretty<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.620> pretty<00:03:18.980> rough

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
does it does look pretty a pretty rough

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.180 
does it does look pretty a pretty rough
however<00:03:20.420> look<00:03:20.810> at<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> swiss<00:03:21.230> franc<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.890> is

are in dollar a dollar denominated so

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.750 
are in dollar a dollar denominated so
things<00:03:32.810> are<00:03:33.019> not<00:03:33.530> as<00:03:33.590> good<00:03:33.890> as<00:03:34.010> they<00:03:34.160> were<00:03:34.220> pre

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
things are not as good as they were pre

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.580 
things are not as good as they were pre
what<00:03:35.359> happened<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.900> swiss<00:03:36.109> franc<00:03:36.410> in

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
what happened with the swiss franc in

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.440 
what happened with the swiss franc in
middle<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.890> january<00:03:37.340> but<00:03:37.820> probably<00:03:38.180> actually

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
middle of january but probably actually

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.509 
middle of january but probably actually
every<00:03:39.019> day<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.320> gets<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.620> bit<00:03:39.650> better<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.190> a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
every day it gets a bit better as a

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.490 
every day it gets a bit better as a
dollar<00:03:40.820> goes<00:03:41.030> up<00:03:41.269> they've<00:03:41.780> all<00:03:41.959> put<00:03:42.200> through<00:03:42.470> a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
dollar goes up they've all put through a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.590 
dollar goes up they've all put through a
sort<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.130> round<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.549> price<00:03:43.790> increases<00:03:44.299> in

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
sort of a round of price increases in

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.349 
sort of a round of price increases in
euroland<00:03:45.200> they're<00:03:45.920> also<00:03:46.359> introducing

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
euroland they're also introducing

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.090 
euroland they're also introducing
different<00:03:47.480> changes<00:03:48.049> in<00:03:48.200> working<00:03:48.530> practices

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
different changes in working practices

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.620 
different changes in working practices
so<00:03:49.549> i<00:03:49.579> think<00:03:49.670> they're<00:03:49.970> working<00:03:50.329> hard<00:03:50.510> to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
so i think they're working hard to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.050 
so i think they're working hard to
offset<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.650> impact<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.730> currency

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
offset the impact of the of the currency

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.090 
offset the impact of the of the currency
as<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.449> result<00:03:53.989> profitability<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.949> the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
as a result profitability of the

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.100 
as a result profitability of the
industry<00:03:55.549> probably<00:03:56.150> won't<00:03:56.389> be<00:03:56.570> in

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
industry probably won't be in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.320 
industry probably won't be in
as<00:03:57.410> much<00:03:57.590> as<00:03:57.860> people<00:03:58.130> were<00:03:58.520> worried<00:03:58.820> about<00:03:58.910> so

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
as much as people were worried about so

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.660 
as much as people were worried about so
