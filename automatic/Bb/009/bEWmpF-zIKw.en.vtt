00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.510
 Welcome to this edition of the driving school 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.069
 Today's episode is about the Barnim main and its right 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.119
 To be able to get off the ground by bike, of course, you have to 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.539
 jump the trick in the matter is to jump from the bike with the bike 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.210
 and that goes like this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.279
 from the forehead Rolf position had upper body down to get momentum 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.359
 to be able to 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.710
 The arms wave at it as well as the legs 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 this is the necessary posture to make a jump 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.220
 I want to jump off with both wheels at the same time 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.430
 Use the rear wheel as a jump lever 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.760
 The weight must be shifted to the jump to the rear 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.780
 It is ideal to have the center of gravity in the jump just above the rear wheel 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.230
 So you push off first with the hands of Lenka diagonally behind 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.330
 and then van Gaal I here while rowing so the front wheel lifts 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.040
 As soon as the calls take off you have to go on while you continue the handlebar itself 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.270
 pulls the legs force to full weight up to the entire body weight 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090
 to get 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.110
 if the upper body is then at the top position pushes the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 Handlebar forward again while pulling on the legs 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.070
 This pulls up the rear wheel and can overcome obstacles 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 only the landing is missing 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.500
 but let stretch 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 the legs stretch again and as far as the best comes up pretty deep 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 error 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 that does not hurt so much and spares the joints and the material 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.370
 if you want to land particularly soft you should expose with the characters 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.370
 this reduces especially the on impact force 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.370
 For a train station you need a lot of power but with regular 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.390
 He certainly achieves faster success with sda 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.820
 When buying one can apply in many areas 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.890
 around WÃ¼rzburg Tel 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.970
 or even longer obstacles to jump 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.820
 or to jump on it somewhere or was on and then but only over 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.820
 particularly sensitive and sick professionals fall back 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.209
 or on a sloping order 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.310
 jump up and down again 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.419
 or from one oblique to the other over short or 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 Ha 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:34.099
 Prof next to actually the contract would be nothing if you 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.939
 come over it 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.379
 and you can increase yourself 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.649
 when he learned to jump or jump 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.209
 a short board is very helpful in the beginning to not pop against the edge 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.379
 and to get his plates or to damage possible cases
