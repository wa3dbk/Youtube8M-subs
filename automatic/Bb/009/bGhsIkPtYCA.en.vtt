for overall I think the game plays very
well<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:33.899> there's<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> huge<00:00:34.860> AI

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
well and I think there's a huge AI

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430 
well and I think there's a huge AI
improvement<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.140> talking

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
improvement you know when I was talking

improvement you know when I was talking
about<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.129> game<00:00:38.370> before<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:39.450> couple<00:00:39.989> months

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

about this game before a couple months
ago<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> couple<00:00:40.950> people<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> they're

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
ago with a couple people and they're

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
ago with a couple people and they're
like<00:00:41.640> yeah<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> AI

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
like yeah they really don't think the AI

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
like yeah they really don't think the AI
is<00:00:43.500> gonna<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> much<00:00:44.309> different<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
is gonna be that much different and you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.799 
is gonna be that much different and you

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

know EA is always claiming that it's
it's<00:00:50.510> improving<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.260> surely<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.770> never

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's improving but surely it never

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's improving but surely it never
really<00:00:53.250> does<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> biggest<00:00:54.989> things
