00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
live until May twenty first and then we

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.760 
live until May twenty first and then we
just<00:00:43.210> might<00:00:43.450> see<00:00:43.480> with<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.960> rapture<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.560> all

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
just might see with the rapture and all

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.880 
just might see with the rapture and all
of<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.220> stuff<00:00:45.670> if<00:00:46.239> we<00:00:46.390> do<00:00:46.600> make<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:46.960> 2012

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
of that stuff if we do make it to 2012

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.830 
of that stuff if we do make it to 2012
we<00:00:48.070> should<00:00:48.280> be<00:00:48.430> seeing<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.820> 4g<00:00:49.270> network<00:00:49.660> on

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
we should be seeing the 4g network on

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.830 
we should be seeing the 4g network on
the<00:00:50.200> iphone<00:00:50.710> 6<00:00:51.190> or<00:00:51.550> whatever<00:00:51.700> Apple<00:00:52.480> decides

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840

the iphone 6 or whatever Apple decides
to<00:00:53.020> call<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.350> they<00:00:53.500> don't<00:00:53.710> call<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.160> iphone

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
to call it they don't call it the iphone

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.660 
to call it they don't call it the iphone
4s<00:00:55.149> this<00:00:55.480> year<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:56.110> iphone<00:00:56.500> 4s<00:00:56.980> is<00:00:57.250> rumored<00:00:57.640> to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
4s this year the iphone 4s is rumored to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.819 
4s this year the iphone 4s is rumored to
come<00:00:57.880> out<00:00:58.000> this<00:00:58.270> year<00:00:58.329> in<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.809> fall<00:00:59.290> so<00:00:59.680> we

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
come out this year in the fall so we

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.100 
come out this year in the fall so we
should<00:01:00.070> be<00:01:00.250> seeing<00:01:00.550> somewhat<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.450> a<00:01:01.570> faster

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
should be seeing somewhat of a faster

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.039 
should be seeing somewhat of a faster
iphone<00:01:02.559> 4<00:01:02.890> kind<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.610> similar<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.390> 3gs

dollars more a month but we should be

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.109 
dollars more a month but we should be
seeing<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.810> sometime<00:01:35.260> in<00:01:35.400> 2012<00:01:36.400> like<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:37.060> said

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
seeing this sometime in 2012 like I said

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.109 
seeing this sometime in 2012 like I said
if<00:01:37.450> we're<00:01:37.630> still<00:01:37.900> alive<00:01:38.700> yeah<00:01:39.700> we<00:01:39.880> need<00:01:40.030> to

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
if we're still alive yeah we need to

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.179 
if we're still alive yeah we need to
find<00:01:40.330> John<00:01:40.600> Cusack<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.439> save<00:01:41.680> us<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.040> we'll

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
find John Cusack to save us and we'll

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.920 
find John Cusack to save us and we'll
have<00:01:42.340> Woody<00:01:42.610> Harrelson<00:01:43.180> predicting<00:01:43.720> things

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
have Woody Harrelson predicting things

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.960 
have Woody Harrelson predicting things
anyways<00:01:44.439> so<00:01:44.890> yeah<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.220> new<00:01:45.460> network<00:01:45.790> is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
anyways so yeah this new network is

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.999 
anyways so yeah this new network is
super<00:01:46.600> fast<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.200> once<00:01:47.470> they<00:01:47.650> add<00:01:47.830> the

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
super fast and once they add the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.399 
super fast and once they add the
t-mobile<00:01:48.490> network<00:01:48.850> who<00:01:49.299> knows<00:01:49.540> how<00:01:49.780> fast<00:01:50.110> it's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
t-mobile network who knows how fast it's

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.010 
t-mobile network who knows how fast it's
going<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.650> be<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:50.860> have<00:01:51.340> no<00:01:51.700> clue<00:01:52.060> maybe<00:01:52.840> it'll
