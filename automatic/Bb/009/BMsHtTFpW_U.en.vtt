with<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.760> razor<00:00:37.970> or<00:00:38.270> other<00:00:38.900> times<00:00:39.200> if<00:00:39.350> you

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
with the razor or other times if you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.390 
with the razor or other times if you
just<00:00:39.530> pull<00:00:39.710> on<00:00:39.740> them<00:00:39.980> because<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.310> just

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
just pull on them because it's just

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.070 
just pull on them because it's just
older<00:00:40.790> plastic<00:00:41.240> it<00:00:41.300> has<00:00:41.360> fatigue<00:00:41.780> over<00:00:41.930> time

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
so you have one here we do have to pull

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.559 
so you have one here we do have to pull
back<00:01:12.259> another<00:01:13.009> one<00:01:13.130> here<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:13.609> another<00:01:14.329> one

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:14.569 
back another one here and another one

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:15.819 
back another one here and another one
here<00:01:14.719> and<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.229> give<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.439> another<00:01:15.469> look

between the parking light and low beam
assembly<00:01:17.929> this<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.229> tab<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.799> talking

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
assembly this is a tab I was talking

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.039 
assembly this is a tab I was talking
about<00:01:19.189> earlier<00:01:19.509> which<00:01:20.509> does<00:01:20.749> need<00:01:20.929> to<00:01:20.960> be

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
about earlier which does need to be

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.899 
about earlier which does need to be
pulled<00:01:21.380> back<00:01:21.530> as<00:01:21.740> well<00:01:21.920> luckily<00:01:22.549> when<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.759> are

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
pulled back as well luckily when you are

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.879 
pulled back as well luckily when you are
popping<00:01:23.299> these<00:01:23.389> tabs<00:01:23.689> up<00:01:24.020> there's<00:01:24.469> a<00:01:24.560> certain

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
popping these tabs up there's a certain

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.050 
popping these tabs up there's a certain
amount<00:01:25.009> of<00:01:25.130> prep<00:01:25.310> does<00:01:25.490> hold<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.819> assembly

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
amount of prep does hold the assembly

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.489 
amount of prep does hold the assembly
together<00:01:26.539> so<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.929> don't<00:01:26.960> actually<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.439> to

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
together so you don't actually have to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.349 
together so you don't actually have to
worry<00:01:27.590> about<00:01:27.859> them<00:01:28.159> popping<00:01:28.579> back<00:01:28.700> closed<00:01:29.060> on

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
worry about them popping back closed on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.230 
worry about them popping back closed on
you<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:29.719> you<00:01:30.530> need<00:01:30.679> you<00:01:31.549> know<00:01:31.670> more<00:01:31.909> than<00:01:32.030> just

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
you and you need you know more than just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.059 
you and you need you know more than just
a<00:01:32.299> single<00:01:32.450> pair<00:01:32.749> of<00:01:32.810> hands<00:01:33.139> to<00:01:33.619> take<00:01:33.979> this

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
a single pair of hands to take this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.590
