 Hello everyone today, we will analyze one of 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 most popular improvisations based on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.000
 simple collegiate fight means sounds 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000
 it is so 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:35.510
 Well, such a topic I will immediately say that it is 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:40.510
 my favorite theme is most of the songs i 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.100
 I play it here with this fight 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.010
 It is played as follows: 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.350
 simple Zurich battles 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.350
 down down and once again down nails 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.940
 here and further and further down up down 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.370
 up down up and down nails 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.670
 that is, three times down up and nails 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.670
 way down 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.110
 like this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.750
 at 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.760
 now combine both parts together 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.760
 it turns out like this 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 but 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.109
 if you play a pick, then basically everything 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:44.730
 same thing just beats down we play 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:46.560
 how would dad himself only those blows 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.120
 which we played nails we play by 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.420
 lower strings but to highlight them 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 somehow 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.540
 Here's a fight to study it well, he 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.130
 cool 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.960
 Thank you all for your attention
