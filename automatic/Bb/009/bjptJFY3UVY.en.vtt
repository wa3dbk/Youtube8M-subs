 the moment when was 300,000 well 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.740
 I somehow waited a little 30 303 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.990
 how are we growing fast on this 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.880
 would only be happy now would have champagne 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.010

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 important be you congratulate why am i 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.789
 I will call you because it is merit 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.350
 not only mine and yours means you 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.059

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.929
 video and I appreciate it I would love to 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.109
 replied to all your comments if 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.370
 helped but imagine you 30001 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.620
 so I created a random rubric 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 conversations where I reply to your comments 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.769
 which you ask me under the video 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.420
 answer the next issue I think this is for you 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.519
 help our call all the comments there 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.300
 further there are still many many interesting 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.039
 headings 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 which I won't talk about yet 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.690
 let's see how I will enter them with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.750
 time to see what will lead to this 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.610
 for now what is waiting for me 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.440
 tests are waiting for me about their exam 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 approaching session so now with 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.000
 video from video is such a tense point i 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.080
 I still try to do them every day. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.940
 but this is not always the case. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 as subscribers grow there we'll see 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.380
 other headings about platoon training 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
 I understood that the rubric is not bad but still 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.770
 together so why are you going to be on it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 work when you're not sliding start i 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 I do not know and how I will recruit on 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.390
 platoon training people I don't know either 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 so let's see how everything goes with 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.230
 time to think, I understand that all of you 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.370
 most want to play well, but not all of 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.070
 at least some amount 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.620
 man wanted to play 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 I present him with each play 30,000 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 man play every beat it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.160
 somehow bust but see what you can 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.620
 still try to do somehow 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.740
 satisfy most of the audience 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.390
 You can all but see in general I 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.360
 I want to congratulate you not only with words but 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.170

 signed no generally decent all this 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.030
 it was easy to do everything therefore 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.980
 literally a minute lived all the settings 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.470
 This is the first part of the draw and there will be 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330

 this video which you watch you this 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.850
 the video will send surely like and

 leave a comment the subject itself 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.800

 which will receive the 2500 Golda but it is still 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.100
 not everything that is theoretically 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.530
 purely on two channels having one youtube 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.930
 account if a person can get lucky 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.180

 there will be caps hanging from podcasts 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.260
 draw and so on it needs to be 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.510
 like or later this should do 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.630
 how is it at my sasha bank 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.160
 accordingly two winners will be
