I<00:00:19.490> looked<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.609> like<00:00:20.760> five<00:00:20.970> videos<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.539> YouTube

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
I looked at like five videos on YouTube

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.980 
I looked at like five videos on YouTube
and<00:00:22.140> each<00:00:23.070> one<00:00:23.460> such<00:00:23.850> thing<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.359> Mesa's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and each one such thing going Mesa's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
and each one such thing going Mesa's
span<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.859> number<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.939> were<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.210> the
