they're<00:01:45.349> working<00:01:45.709> on<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.009> monster<00:01:46.399> patch

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:46.669 
they're working on like a monster patch

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.499 
they're working on like a monster patch
i<00:01:46.880> think<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.179> like<00:01:47.329> two<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:49.520> two<00:01:50.240> patches

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
i think it's like two it's two patches

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.809 
i think it's like two it's two patches
that<00:01:51.109> will<00:01:51.349> they'll<00:01:51.889> be<00:01:51.919> updated<00:01:52.549> over<00:01:52.789> time

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
that will they'll be updated over time

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.639 
that will they'll be updated over time
the<00:01:53.299> first<00:01:53.329> one<00:01:53.689> already<00:01:53.840> went<00:01:54.169> live<00:01:54.349> and<00:01:54.590> it

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
the first one already went live and it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.739 
the first one already went live and it
was<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.889> some<00:01:55.069> basic<00:01:55.459> stuff<00:01:55.579> but<00:01:56.539> now<00:01:56.689> the

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
was just some basic stuff but now the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.709 
was just some basic stuff but now the
second<00:01:57.439> one<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.590> just<00:01:57.889> waiting<00:01:58.249> to<00:01:58.849> go<00:01:58.969> live<00:01:59.209> I

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
second one is just waiting to go live I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.510 
second one is just waiting to go live I
think<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.349> pending<00:02:00.799> I<00:02:00.979> think<00:02:01.189> that's<00:02:01.369> what

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
think it's pending I think that's what

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.519 
think it's pending I think that's what
they<00:02:01.639> said<00:02:01.789> so<00:02:01.969> should<00:02:02.179> be<00:02:02.299> live<00:02:02.509> soon<00:02:02.899> I'm<00:02:03.349> not

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
they said so should be live soon I'm not

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.690 
they said so should be live soon I'm not
really<00:02:03.709> sure<00:02:03.799> if<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.159> going<00:02:04.279> to<00:02:04.369> cover<00:02:04.520> the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
really sure if it's going to cover the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.300 
really sure if it's going to cover the
guns<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.149> stuff<00:02:05.209> but<00:02:05.450> hopefully<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.929> does

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
guns and stuff but hopefully it does

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.680 
guns and stuff but hopefully it does
there's<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.549> a<00:02:07.609> couple<00:02:07.639> little<00:02:08.119> issues<00:02:08.270> in

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
there's just a couple little issues in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.059 
there's just a couple little issues in
the<00:02:08.780> game<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.140> that's<00:02:09.500> not<00:02:09.649> really<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> point

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
the game and that's not really the point

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.970 
the game and that's not really the point
the<00:02:10.429> point<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.940> gun<00:02:11.150> balancing<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.770> gun

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the point is the gun balancing this gun

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.610 
the point is the gun balancing this gun
that<00:02:13.160> i'm<00:02:13.250> using<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.670> hbr<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.150> three<00:02:14.660> feels

that i'm using the hbr a three feels

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.380 
that i'm using the hbr a three feels
like<00:02:15.860> an<00:02:15.980> AR<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.580> feels<00:02:16.820> like<00:02:16.910> an<00:02:17.090> assault

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
like an AR it feels like an assault

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.620 
like an AR it feels like an assault

if they're going to buff other guns and

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.640 
if they're going to buff other guns and
ignore<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.210> bow<00:03:17.570> or<00:03:17.930> if<00:03:18.050> they're<00:03:18.200> gonna<00:03:18.320> nerf

I'm<00:03:20.720> not<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.020> sure<00:03:21.110> how<00:03:21.410> that's<00:03:21.590> going<00:03:21.710> to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
I'm not really sure how that's going to

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.740 
I'm not really sure how that's going to
work<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:22.160> hope<00:03:22.520> they<00:03:22.730> give<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.150> subs<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.570> buff

work I hope they give the subs a buff

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.150 
work I hope they give the subs a buff
though<00:03:23.960> because<00:03:24.110> rue<00:03:24.380> subs<00:03:24.650> really<00:03:24.890> have<00:03:24.980> no

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.130 
though because rue subs really have no
chance<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.670> this<00:03:26.120> game<00:03:26.240> they<00:03:26.570> definitely<00:03:26.870> feel

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
chance in this game they definitely feel

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.660 
chance in this game they definitely feel
realistic<00:03:27.470> though<00:03:27.800> because<00:03:28.010> that's<00:03:28.310> how<00:03:28.400> subs

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
realistic though because that's how subs

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.540 
realistic though because that's how subs
are<00:03:29.080> but<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.290> terms<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.650> gameplay<00:03:30.950> just<00:03:31.430> not

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
are but in terms of gameplay just not

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.090 
are but in terms of gameplay just not
fun<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.790> use<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.890> maps

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
fun to use one just because the maps

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.940 
fun to use one just because the maps
there<00:03:34.910> although<00:03:35.390> they're<00:03:35.630> smaller<00:03:36.110> than

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
there although they're smaller than

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.570 
there although they're smaller than
ghosts<00:03:37.310> maps<00:03:37.490> they're<00:03:37.820> not<00:03:38.110> tiny<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.860> you

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
ghosts maps they're not tiny and so you

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.040 
ghosts maps they're not tiny and so you
really<00:03:40.940> wouldn't<00:03:41.180> be<00:03:41.270> able<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.510> use<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.630> sub<00:03:41.900> it

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
really wouldn't be able to use a sub it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680 
really wouldn't be able to use a sub it
it's<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.380> AR<00:03:42.620> dominant<00:03:43.070> game<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:43.660> yeah<00:03:44.660> I

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
it's just a AR dominant game so yeah I

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.060 
it's just a AR dominant game so yeah I
hope<00:03:44.990> that<00:03:45.170> they<00:03:45.320> are<00:03:45.380> able<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.740> do<00:03:45.860> something

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
hope that they are able to do something

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.310 
hope that they are able to do something
about<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:47.600> submachine<00:03:47.930> guns<00:03:48.200> because

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.270 
I'm a I'm a sub player I love it that's
why<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> b<00:03:50.900> al<00:03:51.140> feels<00:03:51.440> really<00:03:51.680> good<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:51.920> me<00:03:52.070> is

because it's a it's pretty much a

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
really really like the hbr i think it

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.270 
really really like the hbr i think it
feels<00:06:10.310> most<00:06:10.639> like<00:06:10.880> an<00:06:11.030> AR<00:06:11.410> it's<00:06:12.410> got<00:06:12.680> that<00:06:12.889> you

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
feels most like an AR it's got that you

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.860 
feels most like an AR it's got that you
know<00:06:13.310> that<00:06:13.550> recoil<00:06:14.060> it's<00:06:14.510> got<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.970> the<00:06:16.970> slower

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
know that recoil it's got the the slower

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.110 
know that recoil it's got the the slower
rate<00:06:18.590> of<00:06:18.740> fire<00:06:18.919> than<00:06:19.190> a<00:06:19.220> submachine<00:06:19.820> gun<00:06:19.970> it's

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
rate of fire than a submachine gun it's

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.620 
rate of fire than a submachine gun it's
not<00:06:20.180> slow<00:06:20.690> but<00:06:20.990> it's<00:06:21.110> not<00:06:21.260> fast<00:06:21.590> like<00:06:22.130> the<00:06:22.280> bow

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
not slow but it's not fast like the bow

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.080 
not slow but it's not fast like the bow
or<00:06:23.630> a<00:06:23.720> sub<00:06:24.050> and<00:06:24.349> it's<00:06:25.130> got<00:06:25.310> really<00:06:25.550> good<00:06:25.669> damage

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
or a sub and it's got really good damage

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.180 
or a sub and it's got really good damage
does<00:06:26.360> really<00:06:26.599> damage<00:06:27.020> i<00:06:27.139> feel<00:06:27.349> like<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.889> beat

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
does really damage i feel like the beat

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.159 
does really damage i feel like the beat
or<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.580> hbr<00:06:28.940> is<00:06:29.300> what<00:06:29.539> everything<00:06:29.960> should<00:06:30.139> be

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
or the hbr is what everything should be

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.719 
or the hbr is what everything should be
based<00:06:30.440> off<00:06:30.740> of<00:06:30.770> and<00:06:31.099> i<00:06:31.250> don't<00:06:31.400> know<00:06:31.460> how<00:06:31.610> this

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
based off of and i don't know how this

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.120 
based off of and i don't know how this
guy<00:06:31.940> survived<00:06:32.479> you<00:06:33.110> didn't<00:06:33.349> have<00:06:33.560> this<00:06:33.830> damn

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
guy survived you didn't have this damn

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.760 
guy survived you didn't have this damn
hit<00:06:34.340> marker<00:06:34.729> so<00:06:35.389> i'm<00:06:35.720> not<00:06:35.810> really<00:06:35.990> sure<00:06:36.110> what

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
hit marker so i'm not really sure what

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.149 
hit marker so i'm not really sure what
was<00:06:36.889> going<00:06:37.039> on<00:06:37.160> about<00:06:37.310> that<00:06:37.550> but<00:06:38.680> yeah<00:06:39.680> i<00:06:39.950> just

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
was going on about that but yeah i just

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.839 
was going on about that but yeah i just
think<00:06:40.370> i<00:06:41.080> think<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.140> hbr<00:06:42.500> is<00:06:42.860> should<00:06:43.580> be<00:06:43.700> like

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
think i think the hbr is should be like

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:45.100 
think i think the hbr is should be like
the<00:06:43.969> baseline<00:06:44.419> and<00:06:44.599> everything

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
the baseline and everything

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.260 
the baseline and everything
should<00:06:45.230> be<00:06:45.350> based<00:06:45.560> around<00:06:45.830> the<00:06:46.370> hbr<00:06:46.760> because

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
should be based around the hbr because

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.090 
should be based around the hbr because
it<00:06:47.420> feels<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.750> best<00:06:47.990> I<00:06:48.320> feel<00:06:48.710> like<00:06:48.800> it's<00:06:49.010> the

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
it feels the best I feel like it's the

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.780 
it feels the best I feel like it's the
most<00:06:49.310> balanced<00:06:49.790> weapon<00:06:50.320> and<00:06:51.340> as<00:06:52.340> of<00:06:52.580> right<00:06:52.760> now

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
most balanced weapon and as of right now

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.400 
most balanced weapon and as of right now
anyways<00:06:53.390> and<00:06:53.540> that's<00:06:53.690> just<00:06:53.870> my<00:06:53.990> opinion<00:06:54.020> but

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
anyways and that's just my opinion but

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.680 
anyways and that's just my opinion but
it's<00:06:54.740> really<00:06:54.950> fun<00:06:55.130> to<00:06:55.160> use<00:06:55.400> the<00:06:55.610> ak-12<00:06:56.180> is

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
it's really fun to use the ak-12 is

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.800 
it's really fun to use the ak-12 is
really<00:06:56.900> good<00:06:57.020> too<00:06:57.200> but<00:06:57.470> the<00:06:58.540> HPR<00:06:59.540> is<00:06:59.660> my

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
really good too but the HPR is my

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.140 
really good too but the HPR is my
favorite<00:07:00.200> so<00:07:00.580> anyways<00:07:01.580> just<00:07:01.700> want<00:07:01.910> to<00:07:01.970> let<00:07:02.030> you

that<00:07:16.160> amount<00:07:16.400> of<00:07:16.550> percent<00:07:16.880> sure<00:07:17.000> I<00:07:17.030> haven't

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
that amount of percent sure I haven't

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.170 
that amount of percent sure I haven't
counted<00:07:17.450> them<00:07:17.920> but<00:07:18.920> yeah<00:07:19.610> it<00:07:19.850> went<00:07:20.000> pretty

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
counted them but yeah it went pretty

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.790
