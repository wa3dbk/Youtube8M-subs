add a fool you know head printing but

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.960 
add a fool you know head printing but
nothing<00:03:20.260> on<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.040> back<00:03:21.190> toe<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.790> once

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
nothing on the back toe so this once

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.130 
nothing on the back toe so this once
this<00:03:22.270> was<00:03:22.420> identical<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.959> previous<00:03:23.380> versions

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
this was identical to previous versions

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.140 
this was identical to previous versions
so<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.740> clone<00:03:27.780> Rhonda<00:03:29.670> see<00:03:30.670> really

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
so you got the clone Rhonda see really

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.590 
so you got the clone Rhonda see really
really<00:03:31.750> good<00:03:31.959> printing<00:03:32.320> right<00:03:32.440> there<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.600> the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
really good printing right there and the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
colors on helmet a lot darker so you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.720 
colors on helmet a lot darker so you
know<00:03:37.840> more<00:03:38.050> ink<00:03:38.260> was<00:03:38.470> used<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.550> face

looks<00:03:40.030> decent<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.870> my<00:03:41.020> guess<00:03:41.230> but<00:03:41.260> pretty

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
looks decent to my guess but pretty

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.290 
looks decent to my guess but pretty
similar<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.520> previous<00:03:43.030> version<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:46.030> cuz
