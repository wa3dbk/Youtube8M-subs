plane

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
plane

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.980 
plane
the<00:02:46.080> helicopter<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.600> don't<00:02:48.750> know

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
the helicopter and I like I don't know

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.590 
the helicopter and I like I don't know
if<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.350> both<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.360> thought<00:02:51.360> you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
if it's both to this but I thought you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.550 
if it's both to this but I thought you
take<00:02:51.930> some<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.320> teams<00:02:52.590> off<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.410> they

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
take some on teams off and then they

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
take some on teams off and then they
snap<00:02:56.040> right<00:02:56.250> back<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.790> bottom<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.350> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
snap right back on the bottom of it so I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.160 
snap right back on the bottom of it so I
thought<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.710> was<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> little<00:02:59.370> meat

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
thought that was like a little meat

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.140 
thought that was like a little meat
sure<00:03:00.319> let's<00:03:00.560> go<00:03:00.650> rescue<00:03:00.980> somebody<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:01.940> can

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
sure let's go rescue somebody you can

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.360 
sure let's go rescue somebody you can
continue<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.810> pontoon<00:03:03.410> plane<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.250> it's

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
continue a pontoon plane so it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.010 
continue a pontoon plane so it's
basically<00:03:04.550> two<00:03:04.970> planes<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.450> one<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.900> can

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
basically two planes and one and it can

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.870 
basically two planes and one and it can
be<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> Coast<00:03:06.590> Guard<00:03:06.650> check<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> think

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
be like a Coast Guard check so I think

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.229 
be like a Coast Guard check so I think
that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.330> very<00:03:08.360> cool<00:03:09.050> i<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.830> arms<00:03:10.239> profs

that is very cool i like the arms profs

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.020 
that is very cool i like the arms profs

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
on it and you got a nice back end on it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.170 
on it and you got a nice back end on it
