00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.330
 - the card will be inside me 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.509
 with the possibility all the fans to have access to the stadium 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.239
 cheeeee even 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.919
 availability an object from 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.079
 paoloa arrival to use the means of transport of rome 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.359
 for the three days 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 Three days 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 Free admission to some museums 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.159
 the branch more 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.380
 beautiful that has ever been organized 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.810
 in the sense that there are rides 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.130
 putting everything we know 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.950
 and we have to work hard so far I think we have already taken a lot of steps 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 important 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.970
 like the launch of the welcome logo 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.320
 oo a few months ago and we have it 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.510
 a city so important so beautiful that we are historical 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.880
 valuing even more close what is already 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.820
 and today with the opening of the ticket office presented by the EU we have therefore 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.050
 already two of interest will be others that will bring us closer to the game 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 at the marassi stadium 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.370
 I think that 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.300
 safety ahahah for class dinner coupled with what it is 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 success happened yesterday in disgrace 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.260
 lucia inopportune in this case 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.850
 oh we are all like federation 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.850
 in fact, attentive to the performance of forecast 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.060
 back all the wish that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.130
 What happened to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.230
 gravity of what will come at this time we know 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.230
 penetrated by almost and one on the fact that 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.090
 all in room 6 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.420
 it is hoped that at least one spider years in the final will also be read at least 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 school should be in to show up in 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 but we don't even put limits on it, even two balls 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.850
 the wish if we do it 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.660
 I couldn't play a final in Italy though 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.519
 I dare to think of playing in front of your audience 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.319
 I owe the Italian public anyway 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.129
 Italian Italian that you know neither well 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.899
 the player is definitely an advantage 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:22.790
 another thing about the derby instead, she followed what you think last night 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.980
 libertatea.ro entirely at this point the distance on the pursuers is 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.019
 quite considerable 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.299
 I think it really was 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.420
 a spot for soccer is a beautiful match we talk about a soccer one 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.199
 spectacular Italian 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.479
 yesterday's game I think that in addition to emotions it was also qualitatively 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 extraordinary 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.629
 odds and how all verbs could is that of andres stockings also verified 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.889
 yesterday it could happen all in the sense that it could go to the inter on 3 to 0 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.929
 how to match mine 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.879
 you think it was a good game 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.549
 perhaps it is seeing the time from outside and therefore not as a former Milanese 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.369
 the draw would have been 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.799
 a fairer result there are those who have spoken evidence in view of the race 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.239
 yesterday of the urgency to introduce the slow motion in the field you agree 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.659
 in short it is true 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.739
 I honestly don't know the most personal thing 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.019
 many times I don't see the 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.449
 let's say sicilia would notice imaging error that may be between 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:29.389
 many times for many cases it would not be and could not be a common rule 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.119
 just because 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.959
 even in the evening we see Italians and what there is to discuss about 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.269
 moviola or on penalty if I hear you different versions also on the foul on 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.909
 Inzaghi or not every year to his own idea would also be a 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.329
 or more difficult perhaps in the judging cn 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.959
 personally in this case 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.959
 I would be favorable though 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.609
 I think it will take a little bit more Roman time 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.429
 good morning 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.899
 I honestly don't know yesterday's and I think so 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.419
 mood involuntary gesture to me memories adriano the ass 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.259
 thank you talk a little bit in that gesture 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:19.789
 It is also true that a few Sundays before the Milan was canceled a goal is 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.939
 very similar 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:25.110
 hands draw a volunteer 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.060
 it is always difficult to make the referee and also unify the decisions of the game 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.600
 game
