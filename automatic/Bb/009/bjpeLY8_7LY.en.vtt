kind<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.370> long<00:05:18.490> nails<00:05:18.699> but<00:05:18.909> they<00:05:19.000> would<00:05:19.120> just

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
kind of long nails but they would just

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.459 
kind of long nails but they would just
break<00:05:19.509> off<00:05:19.750> when<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.020> they<00:05:20.139> reach<00:05:20.319> a<00:05:20.440> certain

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
break off when I they reach a certain

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.390 
break off when I they reach a certain
point<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.099> now<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.430> have<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.759> file<00:05:21.940> them<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:23.400> used

them because they're too long so anybody
over<00:05:27.939> 30<00:05:27.969> I<00:05:28.330> would<00:05:28.479> recommend<00:05:29.169> you<00:05:29.919> take<00:05:30.490> stem

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
over 30 I would recommend you take stem

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.559 
over 30 I would recommend you take stem
kind<00:05:31.449> as<00:05:31.629> a<00:05:31.659> daily<00:05:32.139> supplement<00:05:32.699> because<00:05:33.699> our

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
kind as a daily supplement because our

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.749 
kind as a daily supplement because our
bodies<00:05:35.199> are<00:05:35.229> older<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:36.159> not<00:05:36.250> producing<00:05:36.430> as

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
bodies are older and not producing as

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.360 
bodies are older and not producing as
many<00:05:36.940> stem<00:05:37.210> cells<00:05:37.479> to<00:05:38.080> keep<00:05:38.289> your<00:05:38.560> circulating

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
many stem cells to keep your circulating

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.180 
many stem cells to keep your circulating
levels<00:05:39.699> of<00:05:39.879> stem<00:05:40.509> cells<00:05:40.779> at<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.289> youthful<00:05:41.830> level

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
levels of stem cells at a youthful level

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.339 
levels of stem cells at a youthful level
then<00:05:42.639> you<00:05:43.029> know<00:05:43.150> don't<00:05:43.330> smoke<00:05:43.719> eat<00:05:44.050> your

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
then you know don't smoke eat your

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.890 
then you know don't smoke eat your
vegetables<00:05:44.669> go<00:05:45.669> out<00:05:45.819> and<00:05:45.969> exercise<00:05:46.180> every<00:05:46.719> day

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
vegetables go out and exercise every day

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.200 
vegetables go out and exercise every day
and<00:05:47.229> now<00:05:47.770> science<00:05:48.190> is<00:05:48.279> telling<00:05:48.460> us<00:05:48.699> that<00:05:48.759> stem

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
and now science is telling us that stem

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.019 
and now science is telling us that stem
kind<00:05:49.509> can<00:05:49.990> be<00:05:50.110> added<00:05:50.409> to<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.620> equation<00:05:51.159> and<00:05:51.310> to

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
kind can be added to the equation and to

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.029
