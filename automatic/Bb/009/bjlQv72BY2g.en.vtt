the life cycle of the console lord knows
that<00:02:01.499> we've<00:02:01.679> seen<00:02:01.889> at<00:02:02.039> many<00:02:02.280> iterations<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that we've seen at many iterations of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.379 
that we've seen at many iterations of
the<00:02:03.270> xbox<00:02:03.600> 360<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.280> many<00:02:05.520> many<00:02:05.789> changes

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
the xbox 360 you I and many many changes

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.540 
the xbox 360 you I and many many changes
over<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.749> years<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.889> months<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
over the years and months and all that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.540 
over the years and months and all that
good<00:02:08.700> stuff<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.210> I<00:02:09.740> like<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:10.950> Microsoft<00:02:11.460> do

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
good stuff so I like that Microsoft do

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.640 
good stuff so I like that Microsoft do
keep<00:02:11.760> us<00:02:11.850> updated<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.990> that<00:02:13.260> where

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
keep us updated and to know that where

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.160 
keep us updated and to know that where
they<00:02:14.010> are<00:02:14.129> listening<00:02:14.459> sorry<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.970> our

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
they are listening sorry to our

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.869 
they are listening sorry to our
suggestions<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.700> that

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
suggestions and so on I think that

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.580 
suggestions and so on I think that
external<00:02:18.450> hard<00:02:18.780> drive<00:02:18.930> support<00:02:19.319> is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
external hard drive support is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.170 
external hard drive support is
very<00:02:19.890> important<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.430> especially

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
very important one especially

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.180 
very important one especially
considering<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.900> rather<00:02:22.110> massive<00:02:22.470> game<00:02:22.860> size

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
considering the rather massive game size

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.570 
considering the rather massive game size
of<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> lot<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> next-generation<00:02:24.120> titles

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
of a lot of next-generation titles

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.880 
of a lot of next-generation titles
numerous<00:02:26.580> games<00:02:26.879> are<00:02:27.209> weighing<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.170> about<00:02:28.470> 40

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
numerous games are weighing in about 40

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.670 
numerous games are weighing in about 40
plus<00:02:29.220> gigabytes<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.450> while<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> xbox<00:02:31.530> one

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
plus gigabytes so while the xbox one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.380 
plus gigabytes so while the xbox one
does<00:02:31.890> come<00:02:32.099> with<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.340> rather<00:02:32.580> nicely<00:02:32.940> sized

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
does come with a rather nicely sized

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.479 
does come with a rather nicely sized
internal<00:02:34.200> hard<00:02:34.349> drive<00:02:34.590> knowing<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> can

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
internal hard drive knowing that you can

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.250 
internal hard drive knowing that you can
expand<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.150> ease<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.690> definitely

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
expand it with ease is definitely

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
expand it with ease is definitely
something<00:02:37.530> that's<00:02:37.769> going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.129> be<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> box

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
something that's going to be a box

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.670 
something that's going to be a box
ticked<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.629> lot<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:39.989> when<00:02:40.500> that
