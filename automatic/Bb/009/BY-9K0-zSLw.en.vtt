00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.310
 the gun 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.160
 although I even regretted it because 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.950
 It's too expensive, just the gun and now for me. 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.330
 buy the complete package I'm going to spend 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.600
 carnival package to protect yourself is a 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.190
 Tupi Iraqi guy could also

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.380
 player with those with that weapon 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.020
 It is good for you to change clothes and 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.700
 to protect those who do not compensate 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.229

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.290

 Kill the person together so I will not 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.680
 To change people, there are a lot of people there. 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.530
 that you are doing a great 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.750
 update is buying items that have been 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.519
 sold for a limited time, which is not 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.049
 the case of this shirt from Brazil here 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.020
 then look at the guy gives the tone is standing with 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.330
 pants that I said 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.310
 nor paralyze the bastard to kill him 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.990
 some play iran and he killed himself 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.100
 nor was he paralyzed because he has the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.620
 local pants are ghosts is the 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.290
 then you want to do the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.460
 downgrade, you're getting this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.220
 Brazil you have to download the update 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.840
 There dako in the cup does not turn you're not going 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.230
 find these silver t-shirt 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.230
 buying more in the carnival update 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.430
 these brasil shirts have been 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.470
 resold staff there 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 so if you download the update and if 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 I'm not mistaken, it was 2.6.1 0 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.600
 I'm not sure but I think it was 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.730
 carnival update 16 low this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.740
 good update to have the possibility is 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.680
 buying the brasil shirts 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.570
 only when you come back to upgrade to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.930
 the current version responsible I suggest 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.470
 that you uninstall the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.240
 carnival and king is there do not update 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.010
 On top of that you run a risk still 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.130
 you're missing out on some item you've won 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.180
 in the update there my son did it from there 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.800
 he lost him he lost the gun he 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.870
 won at the Easter event 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.480
 so you have to be very smart 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.180
 With that, you can do that too. 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.090
 in updating it to get that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.020
 There camouflage package is of the snow has 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.140
 how you pick it up it is also and the other 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.450
 What else can I get you? 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.320
 personal is that is any other package 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.690

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.400

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.020
