00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
it's been a little while and this
usually<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:12.119> pass<00:01:12.330> usually<00:01:12.689> doesn't<00:01:12.960> let<00:01:13.080> me

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

trios out of there I doubt it would
probably<00:02:22.760> survive<00:02:23.270> an<00:02:23.480> attack<00:02:23.720> at<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.110> point

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
probably survive an attack at this point

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
probably survive an attack at this point
I<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:26.870> hoping<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.500> critical<00:02:27.950> hit<00:02:28.130> but

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
I was hoping for a critical hit but

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.040 
I was hoping for a critical hit but
he'll<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.760> saw<00:02:29.240> my<00:02:29.390> luck<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.840> last

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
he'll you saw my luck in that last

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.449 
he'll you saw my luck in that last
battle<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.709> hasn't<00:02:31.010> gotten<00:02:31.190> any<00:02:31.280> better

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
battle and it hasn't gotten any better

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.040 
battle and it hasn't gotten any better
since<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:33.459> no<00:02:34.459> critical<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.480> did<00:02:35.750> enough

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
since so no critical but did enough

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.190 
since so no critical but did enough
damage<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.650> I'm<00:02:36.740> glad<00:02:36.980> about<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:38.200> shadow

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200

Pikachu<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.269> choose<00:03:41.540> well<00:03:42.380> Pikachu<00:03:42.830> is

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.520 
this is one of that all those three
since<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.100> could<00:03:52.340> not<00:03:52.549> hear<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.840> game<00:03:54.079> and

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
since I could not hear the game and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.530 
since I could not hear the game and
there's<00:03:54.890> no<00:03:54.950> announcer<00:03:55.610> right<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.239> could

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
with that attack and I'm so sleazy I

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
with that attack and I'm so sleazy I
didn't<00:04:02.299> even<00:04:02.360> check<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.750> hit<00:04:03.590> point<00:04:03.860> count<00:04:04.100> on

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
didn't even check the hit point count on

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.289 
didn't even check the hit point count on
Gardevoir<00:04:05.590> after<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.370> battle<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.000> was<00:04:08.269> just

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
Gardevoir after the battle so I was just

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.150 
Gardevoir after the battle so I was just
like<00:04:08.450> oh<00:04:08.690> god<00:04:08.930> was<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.140> half<00:04:09.500> was<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:09.980> not

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
like oh god was that half was that not

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.199 
like oh god was that half was that not
half<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:13.100> was<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> little<00:04:13.370> worried<00:04:13.910> I<00:04:14.090> was

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
half so I was a little worried I was

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.780 
half so I was a little worried I was
hoping<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.690> wouldn't<00:04:14.870> be<00:04:14.989> taken<00:04:15.350> out

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
hoping that it wouldn't be taken out

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.370 
hoping that it wouldn't be taken out
because<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.060> pokemon<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.600> was<00:04:17.870> worried<00:04:18.290> about

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
because the pokemon I was worried about

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.699 
because the pokemon I was worried about
most<00:04:18.919> when<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.220> saw<00:04:19.669> my<00:04:19.880> opponent

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
most when I saw my opponent

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.110 
most when I saw my opponent
uh<00:04:21.360> selection<00:04:22.360> was<00:04:22.590> nine<00:04:23.590> tails<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.130> f<00:04:24.310> nine

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
uh selection was nine tails and f nine

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.850 
uh selection was nine tails and f nine
tails<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.449> faster<00:04:25.750> than<00:04:25.780> Gardevoir<00:04:26.380> then<00:04:26.680> I'm

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
tails is faster than Gardevoir then I'm

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.499 
tails is faster than Gardevoir then I'm
pretty<00:04:27.100> much<00:04:27.250> good<00:04:27.520> because<00:04:27.639> leafeon<00:04:28.210> cannot

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
pretty much good because leafeon cannot

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.200 
pretty much good because leafeon cannot
do<00:04:28.660> much<00:04:28.900> against<00:04:29.289> it<00:04:29.440> but<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.759> looks<00:04:30.940> like<00:04:31.090> I

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
do much against it but it looks like I

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.080
