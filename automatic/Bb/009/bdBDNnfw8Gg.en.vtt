00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 chapter 24 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.809
 when Saul returned from chasing the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.519
 Philistines were given notice saying 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.370
 here life is in the desert of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 engadí and taking Saúl 3000 men 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.019
 chosen from all israel was looking for 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.960
 David and his men by the summits 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:20.789
 of the rocks of the mountain goats and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.339
 when he came to a sheep fold in the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 road where there was a cave entered Saul 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.810
 in her to cover her feet and david and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 his men were sitting in the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 corners of the cave then the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.920
 David 's men said to him , behold , 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.870
 the day that the Jehovah told you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
 I give your enemy in your hand and you will do 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.150
 with him as it seemed to you and he got up 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.240
 david and quietly cut the edge of the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.190
 mantle of Saul after this was troubled 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.830
 the heart of David because he had cut 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 the edge of Saul's mantle and he said his 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.170
 mens 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 jehovah keeps me from doing such a thing 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.450
 against my lord the anointed one of jehová that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.320
 I extend my hand against him because he is 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.570
 the anointed of jehovah 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.520
 thus he repressed life to his men with 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.580
 words and he did not allow them to 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.310
 stand up against Saul and Saul coming out 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.470
 from the cave he went on his way too 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.210
 David got up later and leaving 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.750
 the cave shouted behind Saul 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.180
 saying my lord the king and when according to 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.030
 I look back David tilted his face 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.520
 grounded and bowed and said the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.680
 Saul life because you hear the words of 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.610
 the cave and they told me to kill you but 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 I forgave you because I said do not extend in my 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.070
 hand against my lord because he is the anointed 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.380
 of jehovah and look father of mine look at the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.190
 edge of your mantle in my hand because I 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.600
 cut the edge of your cloak and do not kill you 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.970
