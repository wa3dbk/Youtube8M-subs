00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.860
 good day greeting conversations friends 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.279
 let's review today an application that 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.330
 it's called animated photos animated photos 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.410
 refers to the creation of a gif 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.759
 animated precisely as I did his 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.320
 name like this that you see here are 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.390
 situations that are recorded with the camera 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.769
 that are then edited to finish what 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.820
 part of the space is going to have a 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.710
 animation will determine the loop of the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.980
 activity which is the time in which 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.300
 begins and ends the animation and then 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 you can save it and share it in 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.199
 your social networks or send by mail 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.210
 electronic or use in a site where 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.180
 the insertion of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.660
 gif which is the format for the animation 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.789
 that is allowed let's review how it 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.949
 make an animated photo here I have 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.339
 some others that I created test 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.989
 who is at least here as well 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.879
 I left static because you can not 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.620
 determine what part of the photo is going 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.749
 encourage I left static of these 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 curtains and the animation is this 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:05.089
 just that it's in the middle we're going to 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.020
 perform a test so you can see here 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.020
 have then 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.979
 the camera is activated automatically and 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 here says to take the picture 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.580
 keep the phone that position is 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 very important this the phone should 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.409
 be totally static and then leave 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 here and we're going to do an exercise to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 that you see, we are going to then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 start here to animate notice how there 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.990
 a watch that you are seeing there in that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 moment in the middle of the screen has 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.390
 finished here an error occurs must 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.860
 be because moved a lot then the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.860
 phone we will try again 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.770
 and here we are doing with 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 a second test we will verify no 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.090
 I can do it still says that the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.070
 image has moved too much today 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.190
 enough or not enough movement 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.660
 let's validate for the last time here if not 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.350
 we do the test with one of the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.610
 Photographs you have created 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.850
 and let's see at this moment 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.590
 not here let's say he could not capture 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.290
 we go to perform the test to take a 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.420
 exercise for you to how you 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.970
 perform the animation here I can 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 tell a photo that I created 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.120
 edit and then here you are going to see 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.110
 something in second I play or press here I 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.600
 I can remove parts of the scene that 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.630
 are going to cheer up for that I have this 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.670
 button and I can here add or remove 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.580
 space in I go to instruments to remove 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.560
 space and forgiveness is the other way around here 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.350
 I'm going to take space for you 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.960
 see how then this curtain goes to 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.390
 gain some movement 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.920
 notice how then it has changed now 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.830
 a little the situation me that if I want 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.750
 I could also remove this space from 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.910
 here 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.290
 everything is done with the finger that also 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.750
 all this curtain is going to have something of 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.380
 movement the last thing I could do 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.570
 suddenly leave some static part 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.980
 for that then we're going to say that 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.790
 we want to let this here do not move 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.520
 look, you have to have 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.800
 something to care obviously because 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.060
 one could make an error 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.060
 in the movement 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.410
 and that does not look 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.290
 it's a bit natural we're going to remove something 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.500
 here and here it could be and we are going to leave 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.970
 this curtain then also static 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 for that I touch the whole curtain 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.879
 I leave it in this blue color 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.580
 and there you have it then, how 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.130
 the situation has changed a bit 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.160
 can save you out a little 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.580
 to make it look 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.010
 more natural and here they have the loop in the 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.680
 loop I can determine how much space 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.230
 will last the action I could indeed 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.110
 change the here when he 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.930
 the flips I can leave it fixed so that 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.180
 only do this move could 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.600
 start after all this is the loop 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.650
 you finish it here below by determining 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.970
 where will it start and where will it 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.970
 finish the action 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.220
 and this is a totally different scream 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:34.949
 of which we had previously this if 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.319
 we want we can save it in what 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.310
 we are doing at this time and now 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.170
 we can here and share it 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.370
 then to share order if you have 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.160
 social media email and 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.310
 messages define where you want 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.890
 share it here I finished it in 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.590
 directly from going up here says 3 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.620
 megabytes and duration of this action 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 automatic his had preconfigured 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.440
 linkedin twitter and facebook you can 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.050
 predetermine some message can leave 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.660
 some of the networks or they can leave some 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.280
 message and this will then be like 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.780
 a kind of link in social networks 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 this comes as a link where the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.110
 people can access and you can see it 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.090
 then in motion or if you 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.330
 have a blog or have as I say 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.650
 some some avatar somewhere that 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.630
 be animated 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.690
 can then insert this gif for 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.640
 take it as an image this is photos 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.980
 animated the new application that is 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.570
 available they get it for teams 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.480
 difference that I already have then 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.760
 I can say that here then watch 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.530
 I want to publish this they get it 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.290
 available of course for windows 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.530
 phone 8 and here is going to leave recently 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.210
 for windows phone 7.5 greetings friends of 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.140
 not that conversations and it will be up to 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.140
 next opportunity
