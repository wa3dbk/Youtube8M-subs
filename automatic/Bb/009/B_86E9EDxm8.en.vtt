00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:11.190
 You say that there is a surgery rises method only remaining not switch back in the Kinki the day before yesterday 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.190
 Completed 110 years of mission 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:26.440
 Through the Article 5 from the western part of the town prince Nara Prefecture connecting to Wakayama jr Wakayama Line 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.490
 You can't buy that and it's the best 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.760
 Between Gosho City and Gojo City, Nara Prefecture 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.570
 It was set up to cross the forest of wind 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:49.940
 The only switchback station Kita Uchi in Kansai 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:54.910
 It is approximately 4 k 6 from house of 5 mats of foottown town to here coming 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.910
 Height difference is also about 50 meters 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:04.320
 It was difficult to build a station on the way because we could not climb all at once with steam locomotives of the Meiji era 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:17.470
 So at that time in the south where the construction was underway, the railway was mainstream for climbing steep slopes 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.470
 I built this role by the switchback method 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 It is a facility that became unnecessary on the current train, but has been left for a long time due to problems such as removal costs 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:44.070
 Beneath Let's take a look at the fact that the movement is in it 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.070
 The train that climbs up the slope from 5 tatami once passes by just beside the home 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:55.110
 Enter the flat track created next to the uphill 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.110
 There is nothing going drum art stop 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.660
 The driver gets off the train and moves to the opposite driver's seat 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.790
 I went back to Imakita direction 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.849
 This also aims at the station's home built in a flat place 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.690
 About 5 minutes after seeing the station 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 It is finally arrival 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 When I leave, I change direction again 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.730
 Head uphill to the next station 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.730
 It is switchback 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:56.510
 The track structure is also complicated by that device, so it is by this unsurprising corporation 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.500
 Do you say that there is a certain reduction to the work of the driver there 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.500
 It has also been reduced so we think more safely enjoy that you use to say 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.269
 In addition to this, there is the advantage that the required time and the time to shut off the level crossings in the station can be shortened 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.269
 There is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:29.780
 Nishi-ku country village living near the railroad crossing 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.780
 It is a former Japanese National Railways of the journal 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.920
 It was only the sound that I was driving this switchback with a steam locomotive every day in the active service 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.730
 It'll is 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.550
 It's bothersome but it's time to stop 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.180
 Both prefectures are involved and pad blood does not stop 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.210
 After Danger, it takes some time to wonder why such a person is necessary 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.210
 Hmm 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.810
 A person in the film woman's house has a secret of vibration 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.459
 I think that is better was Kokura 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.459
 I feel that sad but 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.980
 From that his railroad crossing version chasing 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:26.000
 I was allowed to play well , but I can teach Shogi 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.980
 It feels a little disappointing because it is a famous place 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.190
 After all old nostalgic element of when 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.550
 Image Akieru Tadashi thing 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.360
 It's not a service 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.360
 It is feeling 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.039
 Switchback last day 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.449
 Together a lot of people visited the scene with each of the feelings 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.830
 I'm burning on my chest 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:05:00.409
 Old man thought to cup the gradient 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:06.310
 Ummm, it's rampant, I guess that's what I'm feeling the so-called intrepid history 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:10.060

 I thought Naa nostalgic 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.580
 200 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.580
 Mr. Kojima, a photographer, is one of them 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.920
 People who got on for the first time are not home , but I think that the train is gold and not mine 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.460
 Though 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.210
