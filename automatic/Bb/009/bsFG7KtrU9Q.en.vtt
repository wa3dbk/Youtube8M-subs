real a real can of worms now because I'm

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
then you kind of hear the explanations

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.760 
then you kind of hear the explanations
of<00:02:44.180> circuses<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.080> they<00:02:45.260> trained<00:02:45.530> and<00:02:45.739> that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
of circuses of how they trained and that

this isn't actually happening so to see
this<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.110> kind<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.290> realizing<00:02:48.770> all<00:02:48.920> your

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
this is just kind of realizing all your

worst<00:02:49.310> fears<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:50.750> think<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.170> be

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
worst fears and I don't think to be

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.720 
worst fears and I don't think to be
honest<00:02:51.470> I'm<00:02:51.620> going<00:02:51.770> too<00:02:51.950> far<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.370> saying<00:02:52.400> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
honest I'm going too far in saying that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.640 
honest I'm going too far in saying that
I<00:02:52.760> hope<00:02:53.120> somebody<00:02:53.690> takes<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.020> stick<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.410> some<00:02:54.560> of

I hope somebody takes a stick to some of
the<00:02:54.709> people<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.310> saw<00:02:55.459> wielding<00:02:55.970> them

the people we just saw wielding them
there<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.989> mean<00:02:57.739> is<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.160> an<00:02:58.370> inevitable

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
there I mean is this an inevitable

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.630 
there I mean is this an inevitable
element<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.959> circuses<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.739> it<00:03:01.040> possible<00:03:01.489> to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.020 
Nature and I think a lot a lot of people
do<00:04:39.140> agree<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.440> that<00:04:39.620> now<00:04:40.130> when<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.669> comes<00:04:40.850> to

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
do agree with that now when it comes to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.060 
do agree with that now when it comes to
training<00:04:41.270> say<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.600> poodle<00:04:42.020> or<00:04:42.110> a<00:04:42.169> housecat<00:04:42.710> it's

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
training say a poodle or a housecat it's

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.900 
training say a poodle or a housecat it's
a<00:04:43.190> different<00:04:43.490> story

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
a different story

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.540 
a different story

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
so some countries have outlawed the use

thing to judge but I think a lot of
animal<00:05:07.880> experts<00:05:08.270> say<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:09.290> first<00:05:09.560> step

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
animal experts say that the first step

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.350 
animal experts say that the first step
in<00:05:10.040> dealing<00:05:10.190> with<00:05:10.430> an<00:05:10.550> animal<00:05:10.700> and<00:05:11.120> in<00:05:11.270> a

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
humane way is to make sure they've got

that's just not happening here so and
then<00:05:17.479> so<00:05:17.750> that<00:05:18.710> even<00:05:18.919> if<00:05:19.040> they<00:05:19.160> are<00:05:19.190> treated

that's gonna they're going to be paying

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.460 
that's gonna they're going to be paying
a<00:06:16.490> pretty<00:06:16.760> penny<00:06:16.880> for<00:06:17.180> that<00:06:17.480> and<00:06:17.690> so<00:06:18.169> I<00:06:18.200> think<00:06:18.290> a

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
a pretty penny for that and so I think a

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.020 
a pretty penny for that and so I think a
lot<00:06:18.590> of<00:06:18.740> people<00:06:18.980> agree<00:06:19.190> that<00:06:19.430> properly

lot of people agree that properly

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.629 
lot of people agree that properly
housing<00:06:20.480> these<00:06:20.630> animals<00:06:20.990> is<00:06:21.230> not<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:22.010> reality

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
housing these animals is not a reality

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
now any Yahoo on the off the street can

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.810 
now any Yahoo on the off the street can
come<00:06:44.960> in<00:06:45.110> and<00:06:45.290> and<00:06:45.440> take<00:06:46.040> an<00:06:46.160> exotic<00:06:46.460> animal

like a monkey and and train it to do
tricks<00:06:49.640> and<00:06:50.200> not<00:06:51.200> only<00:06:51.320> that<00:06:51.440> but<00:06:51.650> animal

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
tricks and not only that but animal

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.969 
tricks and not only that but animal
rights<00:06:52.340> here<00:06:53.000> in<00:06:53.180> in<00:06:53.720> Russia<00:06:53.960> are<00:06:54.260> very<00:06:54.440> feeble

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
rights here in in Russia are very feeble

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.100 
rights here in in Russia are very feeble
so<00:06:55.639> when<00:06:55.760> it<00:06:55.850> comes<00:06:56.000> to<00:06:56.120> the<00:06:56.210> prosecutors<00:06:56.870> even

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
so when it comes to the prosecutors even

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.370 
so when it comes to the prosecutors even
getting<00:06:57.740> these<00:06:57.860> these<00:06:57.919> abusers<00:06:58.790> in<00:06:59.180> court<00:07:00.050> and

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
getting these these abusers in court and

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.469 
getting these these abusers in court and
hopefully<00:07:01.190> with<00:07:01.310> some<00:07:01.340> jail<00:07:01.729> time<00:07:01.760> that's

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
hopefully with some jail time that's

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.610 
hopefully with some jail time that's
very<00:07:02.570> difficult<00:07:02.930> in<00:07:03.260> Russia

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
very difficult in Russia

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.100 
very difficult in Russia
to<00:07:03.919> do<00:07:04.070> animals<00:07:04.910> do<00:07:05.060> not<00:07:05.270> have<00:07:05.570> rights<00:07:05.840> when<00:07:06.050> it

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
to do animals do not have rights when it

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.150 
to do animals do not have rights when it
comes<00:07:06.440> to<00:07:07.780> essentially<00:07:08.780> their<00:07:08.930> personhood<00:07:09.380> so

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
comes to essentially their personhood so

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.710 
comes to essentially their personhood so
it'll<00:07:10.400> be<00:07:10.490> very<00:07:10.520> difficult<00:07:10.700> prosecutors<00:07:11.600> are

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 
it'll be very difficult prosecutors are

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.210 
it'll be very difficult prosecutors are
looking<00:07:11.810> at<00:07:12.050> the<00:07:12.140> case<00:07:12.320> and<00:07:12.350> they<00:07:12.560> want<00:07:12.740> to<00:07:13.039> see

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
looking at the case and they want to see

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.560 
looking at the case and they want to see
if<00:07:13.340> they<00:07:13.430> can<00:07:13.490> bring<00:07:13.820> charges<00:07:14.060> against<00:07:14.450> these

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
if they can bring charges against these

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.560 
if they can bring charges against these
people<00:07:14.780> within<00:07:15.620> 10<00:07:16.070> days<00:07:16.210> so<00:07:17.210> it's<00:07:17.360> difficult

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570 
people within 10 days so it's difficult

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.180 
people within 10 days so it's difficult
to<00:07:17.870> call<00:07:18.169> a<00:07:18.200> lot<00:07:18.470> of<00:07:18.590> the<00:07:18.680> world<00:07:18.860> is<00:07:19.039> just

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
to call a lot of the world is just

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.710 
to call a lot of the world is just
outlawing<00:07:19.669> the<00:07:19.820> use<00:07:19.910> of<00:07:20.150> these<00:07:20.270> animals

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
outlawing the use of these animals

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.200 
outlawing the use of these animals
because<00:07:20.930> it<00:07:21.320> time<00:07:21.770> and<00:07:21.919> time<00:07:22.130> again<00:07:22.160> it's<00:07:23.030> been

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
because it time and time again it's been

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.570 
because it time and time again it's been
shown<00:07:23.450> to<00:07:23.660> be<00:07:23.780> done<00:07:23.930> improperly<00:07:24.919> and<00:07:25.220> so<00:07:25.550> I

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580 
shown to be done improperly and so I

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.080 
shown to be done improperly and so I
think<00:07:25.700> a<00:07:25.880> lot<00:07:26.000> of<00:07:26.060> activists<00:07:26.660> here<00:07:26.930> don't

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
think a lot of activists here don't

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.790 
think a lot of activists here don't
necessarily<00:07:29.090> feel<00:07:29.240> confident<00:07:29.780> in<00:07:30.020> Russia's

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
necessarily feel confident in Russia's

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.610 
necessarily feel confident in Russia's
ability<00:07:31.220> to<00:07:31.400> properly<00:07:31.760> regulate<00:07:32.240> this<00:07:33.169> in<00:07:33.500> the
