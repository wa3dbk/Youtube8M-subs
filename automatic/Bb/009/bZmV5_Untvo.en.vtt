00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
installed if I had multiple ones that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
installed if I had multiple ones that
would<00:02:20.550> give<00:02:20.730> me<00:02:20.820> an<00:02:20.910> option<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.840> know

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
ask me to authenticate and then it will

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.120 
ask me to authenticate and then it will
just<00:02:33.870> take<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.080> few<00:02:34.170> minutes<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.710> we'll

just take a few minutes and we'll

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.220 
just take a few minutes and we'll
basically<00:02:35.340> create<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> entire<00:02:36.720> disk<00:02:36.990> there's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
basically create the entire disk there's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
basically create the entire disk there's
really<00:02:37.350> no<00:02:37.500> other<00:02:37.620> steps<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.160> done<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
really no other steps to be done and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.280 
really no other steps to be done and

icon so so don't worry about the image
not<00:03:08.100> being<00:03:08.130> quite<00:03:08.459> correct<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.420> it's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
not being quite correct so when it's

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.210

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
done it renames the drive recovery HD

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.740 
done it renames the drive recovery HD
and<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> won't<00:03:11.910> even<00:03:12.000> actually<00:03:12.330> see<00:03:12.630> it

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and you won't even actually see it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.480 
and you won't even actually see it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that at least in my test that's what it

that at least in my test that's what it
showed<00:04:07.739> now<00:04:08.250> one<00:04:08.430> footnote<00:04:08.700> here<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:09.180> believe

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
showed now one footnote here I believe

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.330 
showed now one footnote here I believe
what<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.750> actually<00:04:09.930> does<00:04:10.230> is<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.560> copies<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
what this actually does is it copies the

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.090 
what this actually does is it copies the
data<00:04:11.940> from<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.570> recovery<00:04:13.320> partition<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.950> your

drive to this external drive so if you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.409 
drive to this external drive so if you
