in profit I'm definitely not complaining

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
in profit I'm definitely not complaining
about<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.000> me<00:01:09.180> they'll<00:01:09.360> go

about that one you can see me they'll go

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
about that one you can see me they'll go
in<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> checking<00:01:10.229> his<00:01:10.409> grass<00:01:10.619> meadows<00:01:11.010> at

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
in and checking his grass meadows at

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.070 
in and checking his grass meadows at
about<00:01:11.400> eighty<00:01:11.670> thousand<00:01:12.360> coins<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:12.930> he

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
about eighty thousand coins I think he

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.570 
about eighty thousand coins I think he
was<00:01:13.200> being<00:01:13.350> price<00:01:13.650> fixed<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> time<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
was being price fixed at the time and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.700 
was being price fixed at the time and
that<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> reason<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.689> him<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.500> in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that was the reason for him going up in

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.730 
that was the reason for him going up in
price<00:01:16.770> by<00:01:17.580> such<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.270> large<00:01:18.600> amount<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.170> coins

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
price by such a large amount of coins

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
price by such a large amount of coins
but<00:01:20.490> anyway<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.210> ahead<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> pick

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but anyway I think we go ahead and pick

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.429 
but anyway I think we go ahead and pick
up<00:01:21.990> some<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.380> players<00:01:22.799> right<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:24.439> because

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
up some more players right now because

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
up some more players right now because
he<00:01:25.530> went<00:01:25.799> into<00:01:25.920> our<00:01:26.130> club<00:01:26.340> I'm<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> end

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
he went into our club I'm going to end

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.429 
he went into our club I'm going to end
up<00:01:27.180> checking<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> fact<00:01:28.200> have

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
up checking and I do in fact have

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
up checking and I do in fact have
