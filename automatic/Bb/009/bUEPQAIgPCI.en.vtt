00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, my friend 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:12.500
 an avid angler asked me to do 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.799
 he has a knife to make a knife out of 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.330
 fast cutter 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.430
 Well, that is, I drank and the blade of the saw 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.670
 bolster is likely to be from 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.119
 stainless steel 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 4 mm thick handle 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.850
 I have not decided yet, but the main thing is that it be 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.880
 such a form 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:42.360
 most likely it will be wooden 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.010
 the hilt will be from the bottom I'm descending plan 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 to make 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.770
 concave by the way about the descents if someone does not 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 knows what it is and why it is eaten 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.260
 Click on the annotation there covered Senka I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 I lead shichko want to say right away I don't 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.629
 great professional in manufacturing 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 cold weapons 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:11.159
 Here in the garage I was lying around 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.530
 here saw teeth already stoked here and on 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.170
 a little rusted but it doesn't matter 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 In general, I cut out a paper template 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.240
 which will make the blade it will 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.240
 here and so somehow 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 I will cut the grinder then 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 sharpen 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:43.850
 I draw a picture like this 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.850
 there will be a blade of me 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:53.869
 here is the wedge I carved actually 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.030
 it was almost a pattern 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.340
 the blade is naturally not polished only 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.979
 accurate and slightly sandpaper downhill 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.560
 selected as they turned out 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.229
 concave 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.899
 Well, as if not very, but all this 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.500
 will naturally be refined 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:16.430
 sanded and so on will be done 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.430
 bolster handle but this is already in the following 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.430
