00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
not really sure what I just grabbed my

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.380 
not really sure what I just grabbed my
case<00:05:54.270> in<00:05:54.950> a<00:05:55.950> con<00:05:56.220> is<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:56.730> doesn't<00:05:57.150> fit

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
case in a con is that it doesn't fit

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.620 
case in a con is that it doesn't fit
with<00:05:57.570> this<00:05:57.750> case<00:05:58.080> on<00:05:58.910> when<00:05:59.910> I<00:05:59.970> fold<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.480> down

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
with this case on when I fold it down

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.560 
with this case on when I fold it down
and<00:06:01.170> try<00:06:01.350> to<00:06:01.380> fit<00:06:01.710> it<00:06:01.830> in<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:02.910> does<00:06:03.180> give<00:06:03.390> your

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
and try to fit it in it does give your

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.290 
and try to fit it in it does give your
macbook<00:06:03.960> quite<00:06:04.260> a<00:06:04.290> bit<00:06:04.500> of<00:06:04.620> bulk<00:06:05.300> you're

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
macbook quite a bit of bulk you're

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.420 
macbook quite a bit of bulk you're
probably<00:06:06.510> thinking<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:07.410> doesn't<00:06:07.860> but<00:06:07.980> it<00:06:08.190> does

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
probably thinking it doesn't but it does

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.040 
probably thinking it doesn't but it does
it<00:06:09.060> gives<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.360> about<00:06:09.540> six<00:06:10.190> extra<00:06:11.190> ounces<00:06:11.670> of

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
it gives it about six extra ounces of

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.490 
it gives it about six extra ounces of
weight<00:06:13.050> on<00:06:13.380> it<00:06:13.850> so<00:06:14.850> overall<00:06:15.300> i<00:06:15.690> think<00:06:15.780> i<00:06:16.440> would

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
weight on it so overall i think i would

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.630 
weight on it so overall i think i would
rate<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.890> case<00:06:17.400> on<00:06:17.730> nine<00:06:18.270> out<00:06:18.600> of<00:06:18.630> ten<00:06:19.640> the

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
rate this case on nine out of ten the

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.320 
rate this case on nine out of ten the
only<00:06:21.060> con<00:06:21.360> is<00:06:21.390> that<00:06:22.190> it<00:06:23.190> doesn't<00:06:23.550> fit<00:06:23.790> in<00:06:23.970> your

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
only con is that it doesn't fit in your

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.270 
only con is that it doesn't fit in your
sleeve<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.290> you<00:06:25.410> don't<00:06:25.560> really<00:06:25.680> need<00:06:25.980> it<00:06:26.100> to

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
sleeve but you don't really need it to

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.390 
sleeve but you don't really need it to
sense<00:06:26.640> it<00:06:26.790> already<00:06:27.000> has<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.180> case<00:06:27.510> on<00:06:27.780> it<00:06:28.400> so

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
sense it already has a case on it so

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.900 
sense it already has a case on it so
that's<00:06:29.610> another<00:06:29.850> good<00:06:30.090> thing<00:06:30.120> about<00:06:31.910> this

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
that's another good thing about this

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.600 
that's another good thing about this
case<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:33.540> my<00:06:33.840> favorite<00:06:34.260> feature<00:06:34.500> has<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.460> be

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
case and my favorite feature has to be

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.330 
case and my favorite feature has to be
the<00:06:36.090> flip<00:06:36.960> out<00:06:37.140> legs

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
the flip out legs

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.550 
the flip out legs
they're<00:06:38.910> just<00:06:39.060> a<00:06:39.180> really<00:06:39.419> nice<00:06:39.570> addition<00:06:40.199> and

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
they're just a really nice addition and

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.240
