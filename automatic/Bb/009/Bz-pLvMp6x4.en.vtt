00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
will recognize the Iron Heart system

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
will recognize the Iron Heart system
here<00:00:34.770> very<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:36.000> similar<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.390> last<00:00:36.510> year<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
here very very similar to last year in

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.680 
here very very similar to last year in
terms<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> looks<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.800> few<00:00:38.010> key<00:00:38.250> changes<00:00:38.730> so

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
terms of looks but a few key changes so

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.069 
terms of looks but a few key changes so
the<00:00:40.399> chicken<00:00:41.399> loop<00:00:41.579> itself<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.690> molded

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the chicken loop itself is a all molded

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.250 
the chicken loop itself is a all molded
rubber<00:00:43.739> piece<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.280> still<00:00:45.239> fits<00:00:45.539> attaches

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
rubber piece now still fits attaches

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.670 
rubber piece now still fits attaches
quick<00:00:47.010> releases<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.230> reconnects<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.289> exactly

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
quick releases and reconnects in exactly

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.069 
quick releases and reconnects in exactly
the<00:00:49.829> same<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:51.270> chicken<00:00:51.570> loop<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> year

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the same way the chicken loop this year

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.180 
the same way the chicken loop this year
is<00:00:52.350> also<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.239> thicker<00:00:54.239> molded<00:00:54.719> rubber<00:00:54.980> with<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is also a thicker molded rubber with a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
is also a thicker molded rubber with a
slightly<00:00:57.059> increase<00:00:57.449> whiff<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> end<00:00:59.239> just

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
slightly increase whiff at the end just

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
slightly increase whiff at the end just
to<00:01:00.270> give<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> bit<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.690> stiffness<00:01:01.050> stop<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
to give it a bit more stiffness stop you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.380 
to give it a bit more stiffness stop you
inadvertently<00:01:02.030> unhooking<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:05.390> attachment

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
inadvertently unhooking the attachment

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
inadvertently unhooking the attachment
point<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.750> where<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> deep<00:01:07.260> our<00:01:07.439> run<00:01:07.710> line

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
point here where the deep our run line

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.670 
point here where the deep our run line
runs<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.030> again<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:10.500> was

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
runs through and back out again that was

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.100 
runs through and back out again that was
previously<00:01:10.950> metal<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> past<00:01:12.420> three

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
previously metal for the past three

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
previously metal for the past three
years<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:13.770> they've<00:01:14.610> changed<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.970> now

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
years or so now they've changed that now

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
years or so now they've changed that now
to<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> plastic<00:01:15.540> system<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.310> no<00:01:17.460> chance

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to a plastic system so there's no chance

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.289 
to a plastic system so there's no chance
of<00:01:17.820> any<00:01:17.970> corrosion<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.310> pin

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of any corrosion at all and the pin

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.990 
of any corrosion at all and the pin
system<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.960> Hound<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.580> plastic

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
system that Hound the the top plastic

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
system that Hound the the top plastic
section<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.450> place<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.409> being<00:01:25.619> replaced

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
section in place is now being replaced

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.480 
section in place is now being replaced
with<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.729> grub<00:01:27.210> screws<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:28.680> allen<00:01:29.040> key<00:01:29.220> heads

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
with to grub screws with allen key heads

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
with to grub screws with allen key heads
on<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.970> super<00:01:30.900> simple<00:01:31.200> now<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> replace

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
on so super simple now just to replace

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
on so super simple now just to replace
the<00:01:32.729> deep<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.060> line<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> no<00:01:34.140> smacking<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the deep power line and no smacking it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.780 
the deep power line and no smacking it
with<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> hammer<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.100> anything<00:01:35.220> else<00:01:35.610> needed

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
with a hammer or anything else needed

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.899 
with a hammer or anything else needed
now<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.170> easy<00:01:37.520> one<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.670> great

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
now so really really easy one of a great

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.760 
now so really really easy one of a great
thing<00:01:39.119> about<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> while<00:01:40.470> we're<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
thing about the while we're on the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.380 
thing about the while we're on the
subject<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.250> near<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> d<00:01:41.729> power<00:01:41.939> line<00:01:42.119> itself

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
subject of near the d power line itself

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.039 
subject of near the d power line itself
is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> deep<00:01:43.380> our<00:01:43.560> line<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.460> need<00:01:44.909> snow<00:01:45.299> doesn't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
is a deep our line now need snow doesn't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
is a deep our line now need snow doesn't
need<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> sewn<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> end<00:01:48.119> anymore

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
need to have a sewn I at the end anymore

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
need to have a sewn I at the end anymore
so<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.990> actually<00:01:49.079> helped<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.680> significant

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so it's actually helped with significant

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.039 
so it's actually helped with significant
see<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.240> actually<00:01:51.299> held<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.810> two

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
see here it's actually held with two

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
see here it's actually held with two
knots<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.530> place<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.520> away<00:01:53.759> on

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
knots in place so if you are away on

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
knots in place so if you are away on
holiday<00:01:53.939> somewhere<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:55.290> snap<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
holiday somewhere and you snap it and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
holiday somewhere and you snap it and
you<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> replacement<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:57.659> can

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
you don't have a replacement you can

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
you don't have a replacement you can
pretty<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.380> any<00:01:58.530> six<00:01:58.890> mil<00:01:59.100> bits<00:01:59.280> spectra

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
pretty much get any six mil bits spectra

while<00:04:25.810> flying<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.260> kite<00:04:26.410> wouldn't<00:04:27.130> recommend

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
while flying the kite wouldn't recommend

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.330 
while flying the kite wouldn't recommend
it<00:04:27.600> obviously<00:04:28.600> for<00:04:28.930> for<00:04:29.620> legal<00:04:29.860> reasons<00:04:29.979> there

it obviously for for legal reasons there

it obviously for for legal reasons there
but<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.389> actually<00:04:31.660> do<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.810> while<00:04:31.930> flying

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
but you can actually do it while flying

but you can actually do it while flying
the<00:04:32.260> kite<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.650> if<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.699> me<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:33.970> you're

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the kite so if you like me and you're

the kite so if you like me and you're

constantly moving between the smaller
sizes<00:04:35.860> say<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.699> seven<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.210> five<00:04:37.510> the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
sizes say like a seven and a five the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.020 
sizes say like a seven and a five the
five<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.130> traditionally<00:04:39.610> keep<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
five you traditionally keep on the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.219 
five you traditionally keep on the
inside<00:04:40.300> setting<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.720> seven<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.080> could

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
inside setting the seven you could

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.480 
inside setting the seven you could
actually<00:04:41.410> keep<00:04:41.680> on<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.889> outside<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.370> it's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
actually keep on the outside and it's

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.219 
actually keep on the outside and it's
always<00:04:42.639> annoying<00:04:42.910> when<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.240> put<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> kite<00:04:44.080> up

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
always annoying when you put the kite up

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.450 
always annoying when you put the kite up
especially<00:04:44.440> if<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:44.800> pretty<00:04:44.979> windy<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.370> then

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
especially if it's pretty windy and then

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.219 
especially if it's pretty windy and then
I<00:04:45.490> have<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.060> land<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.389> again<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.199> can

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
I have to land it again so you can

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.050 
I have to land it again so you can
actually<00:04:47.530> change<00:04:47.860> these<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.520> fly<00:04:48.699> so<00:04:49.000> to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
actually change these on the fly so to

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.620 
actually change these on the fly so to
speak<00:04:49.949> if<00:04:50.949> you<00:04:51.039> want<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.280> adjust<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.300> real

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
speak if you want to adjust the the real

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.260 
speak if you want to adjust the the real
line<00:04:52.840> length<00:04:53.050> fur<00:04:53.199> till<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:54.370> can<00:04:54.550> then<00:04:54.729> also

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
line length fur till you can then also

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.870 
line length fur till you can then also
get<00:04:55.690> into<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.139> this<00:04:56.650> little<00:04:56.860> less<00:04:57.160> section<00:04:57.789> in

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
get into it this little less section in

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.090 
get into it this little less section in
here<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.180> pops<00:04:58.360> out<00:04:58.510> it's<00:04:59.500> also<00:04:59.650> held<00:04:59.949> on

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
here that pops out it's also held on

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.219 
here that pops out it's also held on
nicely<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:00.699> if<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:01.570> did<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.810> inadvertently

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
nicely so if you did it inadvertently

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.200 
nicely so if you did it inadvertently
unclip<00:05:02.860> it<00:05:02.889> I<00:05:03.100> don't<00:05:03.610> know<00:05:03.669> how<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.789> do<00:05:04.060> that

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
unclip it I don't know how you do that

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.969 
unclip it I don't know how you do that
but<00:05:04.270> if<00:05:04.419> you<00:05:04.510> did<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:05.470> wouldn't<00:05:05.650> lose<00:05:05.830> the

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
but if you did you wouldn't lose the

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.469 
but if you did you wouldn't lose the
piece<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.280> again<00:05:06.490> all<00:05:06.699> available<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.240> spares

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
piece and again all available of spares

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.270 
piece and again all available of spares
and<00:05:07.750> you'll<00:05:08.229> see<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:08.590> all<00:05:08.949> nicely

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
and you'll see here all nicely

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.950 
and you'll see here all nicely
color-coded<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.210> know<00:05:10.330> exactly<00:05:10.479> where

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
color-coded so you know exactly where

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.120 
color-coded so you know exactly where
you<00:05:11.080> are<00:05:11.110> as<00:05:11.289> you<00:05:11.380> adjusting<00:05:11.740> your<00:05:11.800> airline

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
you are as you adjusting your airline

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.740 
you are as you adjusting your airline
length<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.970> it's<00:05:13.120> just<00:05:13.270> held<00:05:13.419> in<00:05:13.539> place<00:05:13.660> with

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
length and it's just held in place with

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.960 
length and it's just held in place with
a<00:05:13.960> really<00:05:14.350> neat<00:05:14.560> little<00:05:14.740> fleet<00:05:14.979> system<00:05:15.370> so<00:05:15.910> you

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
a really neat little fleet system so you

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.279 
a really neat little fleet system so you
just<00:05:16.090> adjust<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.840> length<00:05:16.960> where<00:05:17.200> you

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
just adjust it to the length where you

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.840 

and<00:05:29.720> then<00:05:29.980> there<00:05:30.980> we<00:05:31.040> go<00:05:31.160> clicks<00:05:31.490> back<00:05:31.670> in

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
and then there we go clicks back in

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.370 
and then there we go clicks back in
that's<00:05:32.420> actually<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.720> first<00:05:32.840> time<00:05:32.990> I've<00:05:33.230> done

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
that's actually the first time I've done

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.560 
that's actually the first time I've done
that<00:05:33.560> don't<00:05:34.490> even<00:05:34.850> know<00:05:34.940> quite<00:05:35.090> amazed<00:05:35.330> at<00:05:35.480> how

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
that don't even know quite amazed at how

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.270 
that don't even know quite amazed at how
easy<00:05:35.750> that<00:05:35.960> went<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:38.630> moving<00:05:39.110> on<00:05:39.200> lines<00:05:40.130> and

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
easy that went so moving on lines and

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.880 
easy that went so moving on lines and
tells<00:05:40.520> very<00:05:40.760> similar<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.680> don't<00:05:42.680> know<00:05:42.770> the

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
tells very similar I don't know the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.320 
tells very similar I don't know the
technicalities<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:43.940> believe

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
technicalities of it but I believe

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.120 
technicalities of it but I believe
they've<00:05:44.600> put<00:05:44.780> a<00:05:44.810> different<00:05:45.020> coating<00:05:45.830> on<00:05:46.040> the

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
they've put a different coating on the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.500 
they've put a different coating on the
lines<00:05:46.340> themselves<00:05:46.490> they<00:05:46.970> do<00:05:47.030> look<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.420> little

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
lines themselves they do look a little

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.630 
lines themselves they do look a little
bit<00:05:47.960> yellower<00:05:48.380> than<00:05:49.100> they<00:05:49.250> have<00:05:49.400> done<00:05:49.520> in

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
bit yellower than they have done in

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.270 
bit yellower than they have done in
previous<00:05:49.820> years<00:05:50.740> Norfolk<00:05:51.740> been<00:05:51.860> using<00:05:52.160> this
