here<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.130> starts<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.180> garage<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
here it starts out in a garage or you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.680 
here it starts out in a garage or you
have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.559> create<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.829> character<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.690> your

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.350 
company name and eventually you have to
start<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> 80s<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.149> about

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
start out in the 80s I think it's about

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.520 
start out in the 80s I think it's about
the<00:00:42.570> 80s<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.980> 30<00:00:44.250> years<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.640> time

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the 80s and you have 30 years of time

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.110 
the 80s and you have 30 years of time
each<00:00:46.530> few<00:00:47.070> dots<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> upper<00:00:47.969> right

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
each few dots you see in the upper right

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.350 
each few dots you see in the upper right
corner<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.620> week<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.070> pass<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
corner and one week will pass and you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.900 
corner and one week will pass and you
cannot<00:00:51.629> speed<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> game<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.350> slow<00:00:52.559> down

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
cannot speed up the game or slow down

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
cannot speed up the game or slow down
you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.059> pause<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.570> by<00:00:54.719> opening<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.500> menus

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you can pause it by opening the menus

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
you can pause it by opening the menus
but<00:00:56.100> other<00:00:56.309> than<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.910> cannot<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.660> any

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
but other than that you cannot do any

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.760 
but other than that you cannot do any
pause<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.100> speed<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.489> thingies<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.620> have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pause or speed up thingies so you have

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
pause or speed up thingies so you have
30<00:01:01.949> years<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.340> time<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> best<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
30 years of time to do the best to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.070

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
is no protection against that but I

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.080 
is no protection against that but I
think<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.500> this<00:04:51.650> game<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.100> very<00:04:52.490> well<00:04:52.820> worth

think that this game is very well worth

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.570 
think that this game is very well worth
the<00:04:53.300> money<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.630> costs<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.110> think<00:04:54.320> 6<00:04:55.040> euros<00:04:55.430> or

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the money it costs I think 6 euros or

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.000 
the money it costs I think 6 euros or
something<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:57.350> definitely<00:04:57.560> see
