vehicle ribbons for me the easiest way
to<00:00:57.470> do<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.860> was<00:00:58.070> go<00:00:58.310> on<00:00:58.340> go<00:00:58.580> for<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.820> man<00:00:59.060> with<00:00:59.240> a

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
to do this was go on go for a man with a

and try and kill as many vehicles I

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.749 
and try and kill as many vehicles I
could<00:01:04.670> now<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:06.439> don't<00:01:07.070> get<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:07.610> achievement

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
could now you don't get this achievement

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.330

by<00:01:08.390> killing<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.990> crew<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.469> vehicle<00:01:09.950> so

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
by killing the crew of a vehicle so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.370 
by killing the crew of a vehicle so
cancel<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.969> kill<00:01:11.149> if<00:01:11.329> somebody<00:01:11.689> else<00:01:11.899> hits<00:01:12.170> it

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
cancel the kill if somebody else hits it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.099 
cancel the kill if somebody else hits it
afterwards<00:01:13.009> doesn't<00:01:13.810> get<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:14.960> the

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
afterwards doesn't get you the

achievement you need vehicle destroyed

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.149 
achievement you need vehicle destroyed
so<00:01:18.939> disableds<00:01:19.999> hits<00:01:20.649> don't<00:01:21.649> count<00:01:21.950> as

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
so disableds hits don't count as

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.130 
so disableds hits don't count as
anything<00:01:22.579> if<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.270> don't<00:01:23.450> get<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.689> destroy

the flags and I'm then just going out

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.569 
the flags and I'm then just going out
and<00:01:45.109> playing<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.649> game<00:01:45.799> for<00:01:46.039> some<00:01:46.219> reason

will sit there and wait while you go up

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.830

you can see vehicles pass by the flags

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.850 
you can see vehicles pass by the flags
quite<00:02:07.729> often<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.720> get<00:02:08.899> my<00:02:09.050> anti<00:02:09.440> vehicle

got the line of objectives along the
beach<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:24.680> you've<00:02:24.890> got<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:26.209> ones<00:02:26.660> in

area where the tanks are going to be

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.210 
area where the tanks are going to be
most<00:02:32.120> vulnerable<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:33.040> they've<00:02:34.040> got

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
most vulnerable because they've got

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.660 
most vulnerable because they've got
across<00:02:34.550> open<00:02:34.790> ground<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.190> with<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.370> little

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
hill here you can look down on quite a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.820 
hill here you can look down on quite a
few<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.880> objectives<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> straw

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
few of the objectives and the straw

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.600 
few of the objectives and the straw
doesn't<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.910> maximum<00:02:47.450> range<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:49.310> long<00:02:49.489> as

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
doesn't have a maximum range as long as

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.160 
doesn't have a maximum range as long as
you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:50.330> you're<00:02:50.480> shooting<00:02:50.930> up<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
you can see what you're shooting up the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.820 
you can see what you're shooting up the
name<00:02:51.640> you'll<00:02:52.640> get<00:02:53.000> hit<00:02:53.440> in<00:02:54.440> fact<00:02:54.709> the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
name you'll get hit in fact the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.350 
name you'll get hit in fact the
trickiest<00:02:55.190> thing<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:55.580> this<00:02:55.670> assignment<00:02:55.970> is

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
trickiest thing with this assignment is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.660 
trickiest thing with this assignment is
getting<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> final<00:02:57.350> hit<00:02:57.560> before<00:02:58.100> somebody

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
getting the final hit before somebody

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.479 
getting the final hit before somebody
else<00:02:58.700> does<00:02:59.590> there's<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.709> lot<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:00.920> people<00:03:01.160> with

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
else does there's a lot of people with

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.680 
else does there's a lot of people with
rocket<00:03:01.850> launchers<00:03:02.180> trying<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.510> get<00:03:02.600> this

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
rocket launchers trying to get this

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.090 
rocket launchers trying to get this
achievement<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.410> there's<00:03:03.890> another

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
achievement and there's another

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.380 
achievement and there's another
anti-vehicle<00:03:04.610> ribbon<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.760> you're<00:03:08.060> really

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
anti-vehicle ribbon if you're really

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.570 
anti-vehicle ribbon if you're really
lucky<00:03:08.570> there'll<00:03:09.110> be<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.440> nice<00:03:09.680> recon<00:03:10.190> out<00:03:10.310> there

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
lucky there'll be a nice recon out there

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140 
lucky there'll be a nice recon out there
who's<00:03:10.910> blocking<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.459> you'll<00:03:13.850> get

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
who's blocking for you and you'll get

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.170 
who's blocking for you and you'll get
hit<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.709> an<00:03:15.799> idea<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.190> how<00:03:16.459> far<00:03:16.850> away

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
hit so this is an idea of how far away

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.289 
hit so this is an idea of how far away
from<00:03:17.510> this<00:03:18.049> point<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.739> can<00:03:19.040> get<00:03:19.519> vehicle

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
from this point you can get vehicle

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.039 
from this point you can get vehicle
kills<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.670> vehicles<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:23.600> almost<00:03:23.840> no

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
kills so that vehicles but almost no

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.289 
kills so that vehicles but almost no
chance<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.590> hitting<00:03:24.799> you<00:03:25.010> back<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.640> yet<00:03:26.120> you

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
chance of hitting you back and yet you

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.539 
chance of hitting you back and yet you
can<00:03:26.510> quite<00:03:26.959> simply<00:03:27.140> take<00:03:27.620> potshots<00:03:27.920> at<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:30.549> so

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
can quite simply take potshots at it so

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.800 
can quite simply take potshots at it so
I'll<00:03:31.640> show<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:31.910> why<00:03:32.060> I<00:03:32.090> think<00:03:32.180> these<00:03:32.540> five

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
I'll show you why I think these five

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.539 
I'll show you why I think these five
kills<00:03:33.140> need<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.470> be<00:03:33.590> done<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.010> same<00:03:34.190> round

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
kills need to be done in the same round

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.630 
kills need to be done in the same round
but<00:03:35.360> here<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.660> can<00:03:35.840> see<00:03:36.079> I<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:36.799> two<00:03:37.280> kills

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
but here you can see I have two kills

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.610 
but here you can see I have two kills
and<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.299> have<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.570> anti<00:03:38.840> vehicle<00:03:39.290> ribbon

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and I have the anti vehicle ribbon

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.810 
and I have the anti vehicle ribbon
because<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:40.130> joined<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.730> round<00:03:41.030> late<00:03:42.700> but<00:03:43.700> as

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
because I joined this round late but as

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220 
because I joined this round late but as
you<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.030> see<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.390> next<00:03:44.690> round<00:03:44.840> where<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.140> do

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
you can see on the next round where I do

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.370 
you can see on the next round where I do
complete<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.790> white<00:03:47.120> bar<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.900> shows<00:03:48.170> you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
complete it the white bar that shows you

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.710 
complete it the white bar that shows you
what<00:03:48.650> you've<00:03:48.860> previously<00:03:49.250> completed<00:03:49.910> only

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
what you've previously completed only

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.620 
what you've previously completed only
shows<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.769> small<00:03:52.250> section<00:03:52.820> which<00:03:53.299> is<00:03:53.450> for

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
shows that small section which is for

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.190 
shows that small section which is for
the<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:54.110> anti-vehicle<00:03:54.860> ribbon<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:56.780> shows

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
the one anti-vehicle ribbon and it shows

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.039 
the one anti-vehicle ribbon and it shows
that<00:03:57.470> all<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.010> vehicle<00:03:58.730> kills<00:03:59.060> are<00:03:59.420> in<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
that all the vehicle kills are in the

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.069 
that all the vehicle kills are in the
orange<00:04:00.320> section<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.150> does<00:04:02.390> look<00:04:02.600> like<00:04:02.870> you

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
orange section so it does look like you

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.170 
orange section so it does look like you
need<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.260> get<00:04:03.440> all<00:04:03.680> five<00:04:03.950> vehicle<00:04:04.549> kills<00:04:04.820> in

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
need to get all five vehicle kills in

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
wrong gadget now the reload is pretty

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.550 
wrong gadget now the reload is pretty
slow<00:04:47.169> as<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.590> would<00:04:47.710> expect<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:50.020> not<00:04:50.229> going

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560

in<00:04:52.960> fact<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:53.320> think<00:04:53.410> only<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.830> pkp<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.760> slower
