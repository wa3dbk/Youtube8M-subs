00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
serial number on the back we did a laser

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.920 
serial number on the back we did a laser
scan<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> weapon<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.780> actually

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
scan of the weapon you can actually

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
scan of the weapon you can actually
actuate<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.560> weapon<00:03:28.980> all<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.340> parts<00:03:29.730> move

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
actuate the weapon all the parts move

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.460 
actuate the weapon all the parts move
the<00:03:30.209> way<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.510> parts<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:30.900> supposed<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.260> move

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the way the parts are supposed to move

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.710 
the way the parts are supposed to move
so<00:03:32.070> there's<00:03:32.370> an<00:03:32.550> incredible<00:03:33.240> amount<00:03:33.510> of
