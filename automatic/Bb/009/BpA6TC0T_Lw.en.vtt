00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 Banditi! There are hundreds of them! Six hours! 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.700
 They have German markings. 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.160
 Let's get them! 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.440
 Where are the fucking fighters flying? Was there anything left of our escort? 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.120
 Mayday, Mayday! 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.240
 Get ready to jump! 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.260
 They tear our boys to shreds. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.400
 I need pilots to build bombers before themselves 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 When we came under your command, Colonel, you said clearly, 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.780
 that we will never find blacks who lay down pilot strings, 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.520
 they manage the flight school, survive the basic duel. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.660
 We've done it all. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.060
 I don't trust your guys who don't have a single aerial shot. 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.280
 It's damn hard to shoot down an enemy hundreds of miles behind the front line. 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.260
 What do we do, how well do we do, it doesn't matter? 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.500
 And what did you all think? That you break, and that will end hundreds of years of delusion? 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.420
 Head up boy. You're fighter pilots. 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.760
 We have the right to fight for our country, just like any other American. 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.000
 Just don't give up. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.480
 I can't afford the losses we've suffered in the bombers. 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 Can you help us save lives? 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.360
 When you give us new aircraft ... 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.440
 ... so we can help your men. 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.320
 Nothing is complicated. Everything is a challenge. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.280
 Despite adversity - to the stars! 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.320
 From the last plane! The last round! 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.920
 Last minute! To the last man! 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.400
 We fight! 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.560
 We fight! We fight! 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.140
 At all costs, defend the bombers. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.760
 COURAGE 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.000
 Fighters on four hours. Stay with the bombers. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.100
 HAS NO COLOR 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.060
 One bomber, that's ten men. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.240
 We count our victory, 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.440
 how many bombers we get to their target 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.220
 how many men we will return to their wives 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.820
 how many fathers we will return to their children. 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.820
 Yes sir! 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.960
 INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.280
 Come on, Junior! Jump!
