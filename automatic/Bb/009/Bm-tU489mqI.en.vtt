00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.630
 how to scribble on the car exactly and not afraid 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.969
 let the car on speed 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:17.190
 then the strings behind us should help 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.300
 start the line lower the foot 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.119
 we start the reprieve should be oriented 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.060
 paws each has its own foot 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.060
 How far from the edge of the foot will be 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 scribble here let's say I passed so 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.489
 I can already capture 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.879
 the edge of the part means the part itself 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.149
 me should be in arms and in front and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.489
 you can change your hands from behind like this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.680
 convenient and then when you have the item 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.469
 fixed in your hands you let her under 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.180
 look at the car so that 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.840
 will be if you will be neat and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.629
 here hold in front and so here's how 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.439
 then well, here's the car itself, you see for yourself 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.530
 lines all line went to cree taste already 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.530
 you can see it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 not necessarily keep the item 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.829
 fix in both hands 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.829
 when you can already let on speed 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.420
 then the item is fixed see when 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.060
 you let her 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.399
 gravity you can not hold in your hands 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.399
 here hold in your hands any width from 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.890
 the edge of the car will go smoothly then when you 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.950
 you will fix the part in both hands 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.970
 that is, the stitch which stitches you should 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.420
 to manage 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.340
 cloth under the car and the car is just 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.340
 lines and you control the fabric
