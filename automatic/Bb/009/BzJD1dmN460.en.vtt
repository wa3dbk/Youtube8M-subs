00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.970
 there were people this is a blog and roof of 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.589
 wild force pro he had a small 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.060
 problem and it's the next mistake that they 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.300
 I will show below 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.880
 for that we are going to disconnect it from the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.730
 play let's guide the computer 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.910
 because it's faster the problem was the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.990
 next and it is that it is about 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.250
 a flaw in terms of 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.910
 the calibration when we turn on 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 tour 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.050
 now I should stop but not yes 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.079
 the problem this is very simply due 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.420
 now compare to turn the problem this one 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.260
 it looks very simply that in the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.840
 inside there is a little motor that is the one 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.080
 is responsible for making the variation between 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:13.730
 the 180 degrees and the 900 degrees of turn 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:16.670
 or 920 I think they are 900 fair 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.960
 then and that's what it is 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 charge 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.409
 one with a screwdriver they will be able to 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.550
 see below this metal plate below 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.980
 of this metal plate 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.659
 there is a lever that you can move 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.650
 up 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.800
 and down 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.650
 very carefully with a screwdriver 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.570
 is the one that works the mode comes up 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 There is the one that can be for the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.810
 cameras so we have then a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 better view is 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.680
 that is this is the detector 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.800
 when the steering wheel that has locked in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.010
 180 degrees and that's the detector now 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.870
 when I lower this I will tighten the other 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.870
 Detect that lever 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.140
 there you can see the predicament is frank of 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.140
 bed 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.359
 and that is to say enabled mode 180 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.560
 degrees 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:24.569
 the point is 900 degrees down 180 above 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.240
 the point says that when this was left 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.940
 some way worked at 900 degrees 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.430
 that when I connected the steering wheel the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.299
 play 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.310
 it turned and turned and kept turning 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:41.770
 now 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.560
 once we open the joystick 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.250
 the steering wheel hand saw how to say in the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.250
 country of you 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.440
 I said good let's go up then let's leave it there 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.490
 180 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 and let's see now if I connect it to usb which is 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.970
 what happens 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.970
 what happens next 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.720
 you will see that it starts to turn 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.720
 Y 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.370
 light green no error normally 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.680
 begin to use in 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.640
 at intervals or begin to use 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.750
 both at one second intervals and that 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.910
 it means that there is an error in the team 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.700
 what I come from being then is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.350
 ready I see that it works now with the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.910
 flyer on take care by 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.210
 please that the current is connected 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.650
 it's all slathered in fact we can can 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.380
 let in the pedals to make 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.530
 maybe one to have a little less than 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.630
 free cable in the moment here we lower the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.670
 lever be very careful do this 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.640
 with a screwdriver preferably 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.530
 we lower the lever and see that it 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 both lights are on 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.959
 and they are fixed 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.909
 900 degree mode enabled good for 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.480
 all those that they who 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.150
 have this happened to me a technician here 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.180
 from buenos aires told me that you could not 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.419
 prepare told me that the steering wheel was 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.549
 unusable that did not work anymore 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.790
 seen and I've tried in big tourism of 5 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:29.199
 in the steering wheel so open that this 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:33.940
 it works and opening it is very simple 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:36.370
 a total of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 screws in 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.010
 the bottom part that pulls me out very 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.960
 simply with a finite screwdriver 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.699
 in being finite little and once opened 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.700
 please be careful with the lever 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:52.510
 of changes and with the supports 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.920
 exactly with those fixers that go 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.060
 towards the table or surface that are 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.580
 using to play 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.240
 everything is very simple to repair 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.319
 in case they have been broken and they do not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.849
 give up now I do not give myself for 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.520
 expired in these cases because to me 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.949
 love to investigate about this kind of 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.919
 small flaws and effectively what 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.729
 failure is the engine that is responsible for 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.729
 move up and down 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:26.430
 the mode change from 180 degrees to 900 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.540
 so good that's all 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:35.190
 now I'm going to block it in 180 because it's 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.160
 the only way that works well and when 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.440
 play great tourism I will be forced to 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.050
 install in some way a kind of 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.500
 device here that allows me to download and 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.180
 manually raise the lever replacement 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.610
 with the engine for the moment I do not want 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.530
 touch more nothing I do not want to have to 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.580
 disarm and then learn to reassemble what 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.460
 it's a problem 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.650
 but I think if I tell the technician that 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.590
 discovered the mistake and that you change me 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.200
 'little engine' that could be just in case 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.170
 just in case I recommend them 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.290
 there is a very finite cable that is connected 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:14.350
 in the upper left corner of the 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:17.050
 platelet the platelet that they have thus 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.430
 front of that flyer from the side of 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:25.240
 back the platelet left place up 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:27.040
 disconnect this non- red plug from 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.680
 left side black side 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.410
 right disconnect what since that is the 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.460
 feeder for the little engine 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.460
 should be seen 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.360
 and since it hits and the bottom 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:49.310
 and if the motor consell so I do not know 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.310
 worry and that has been all for today 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.280
