00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.920
 at this moment wives and I want to talk both 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.830
 cities we use chalets on 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.910
 metallurgy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.700
 yana will say an example life it was years 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.630
 but it was in the ninetieth year then 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.350
 our group first appeared on 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.680
 big concert 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.580
 by this time I played guitar for years 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.400
 ten and already understood something in notes 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.489
 then one guitar player approached us and with 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.210
 Kazal 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.180
 I know two whole metal acordas 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 this customer 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 their cotton 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.490
 in different styles of guitarist play 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 accords in different ways 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.180
 for example in jazz 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.260
 parakeha 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.130
 bass note that is played on another 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.460
 guitarist playing instrument 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.910
 settings from two three nights and most often 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910
 they play and where are the dancers 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.900
 but if he plays these chords without 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 this bass 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.260
 they will sound suspicious 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.490
 you and I are all very simple clarke m 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 there 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.720
 and if that plays in Europe in pop music 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.779
 are called steam coke 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.439
 this is classic entho records with 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 recurring notes became 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.049
 but they sound very dense shed 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.359
 through the wall of the group 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 they sound very good at overload 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 check cities play this way 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.469
 but we ourselves will not dwell on 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.639
 this further ternation major in the name of the people 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.559
 Do not be fooled by the name 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.869
 major depending on how sings 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.429
 play it can sound very 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:51.389
 brutal 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.389
 Japan 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.809
 the fifth one we will play is 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:00.149
 components of akorda 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.039
 and whichever you put 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.719
 ambassador 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.019
 or that you're completing another guitar 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.609
 may sound minor 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.829
 either major on court no matter 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.749
 which end and play 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.749
 For example 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:24.759
 here I added 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.869
 major experts 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.869
 still minor butt 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.429
 it's a major on court 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.419
 but if I completed the fifth 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.349
 or a fee to teach differently 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.349
 m 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.119
 Doll 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.829
 football 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.199
 can 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.199
 P 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.969
 prim 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 here would have added a sector 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 as you see this is also part submissively 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.189
 now approaching the worst 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.199
 this is the interval which middle ages church 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.389
 banned use in music 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.389
 it is, moreover, 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.720
 it is also called a reduced agent or 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 increased fee 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:08.460
 it is dissonance 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.969
 and it gives your music and anxiety 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.969
 or demonism 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.860
 but now the stream itself attacks are seconds 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 yes yes seconds 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.149
 Now I will show you the reef in which I will 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:37.009
 use 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.599
 major third 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.599
 seconds and fees 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.990
 the most important thing when you look for your 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.009
 sequence of records to be in 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.259
 some kind of canada key 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.789
 but also if you're a fan of stravinsky or 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.069
 know theories 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.839
 variable tonality then not 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.839
 forget demand chop 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.129
 I have to look for approaches 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.599
 for their reefs 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:41.599
 in this the risks i use 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.449
 rent payment 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:01.089
 shower 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:08.800
 b 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.919
 but the year has become its duty today 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.580
 rolls he does not regret good luck
