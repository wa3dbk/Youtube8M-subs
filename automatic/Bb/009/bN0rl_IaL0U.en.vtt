00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.900
 Yes last time the three Kobe City c children of Diatonic 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:13.730
 System new passport cfg 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.449
 Though we looked at role of tonic subdominant and port 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.449
 It is 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.130
 There is also 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.220
 I see you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.820
 It's d minor Imainea Maeda b minor 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:35.970
 This will also have its own role, so let's see 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.970
 Stay home from home forever 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.000
 Is first ride 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 I went to work 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.770
 I went home and then got on the bus again 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.570
 It entered the island Zama 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.850
 I'm home 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.090
 If I repeat it all the time 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.150
 After all the flow will open a 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.560
 Music is much the same way 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:07.420
 It will not be boring if it is a chord progression so it will be returned 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.230
 I want to let me use this proxy code well then 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 1 tonic of the agency said 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.120
 It is the same stability 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.240
 The usable code is this 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.260
 This is it 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.110
 3 and 6 pieces 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.590
 3 minor and 6 pieces 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:35.100
 If this is put, for example 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 3 minor songs by as opposed to 8 cities at home 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.860
 For example, ones determined for everyone 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.220
 I'm in Giza 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.780
 Or my friend's pf 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.450
 Park 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.430
 If you do so, you will not be at home right from the work place, but you will be able to get off a little 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.430
 Do you want to see 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 Hmm 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.990
 No 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.110
 I am 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.530
 Ehe 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.020
 Down handle 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.800
 1 good ah 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.790
 hey 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.810
 day 2 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.739
 After all, So cut noise top 8 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.739
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.140
 Part or ed 2 Once the west what say 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.440
 Wajima 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.440
 Yup 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.590
 Hmm 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.660
 It's just like it 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.490
 It was stable at home 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.060
 The 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:56.300
 I feel relieved not to settle down, but I feel relieved, but not Hanshin 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.970
 is not it 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.030
 And say to and catch the wind, such as bone 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.010
 I think action is easy to understand 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.120
 so 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.690
 Next 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.620
 Used in place of this subdominant f 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.980
 And this time d minor 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.980
 is not it 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.920
 nina minor this too 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.660
 4 can be used as a surrogate and by all means this 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.250
 5 sheets of 7 minor flat files 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:35.920
 This can be used as a dominant class 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:41.439
 It is a guard that emerged as this bottle minor rat body part 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.550
 It's not so much in real life Well what a race is 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.030
 7 minutes in the state 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.900
 Five 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.940
 I often go out 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.660
 It is practically it 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:01.850
 So let's learn this first 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:05.430
 If the music formed just by going to this diagram comes out, you will always be in the city 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.990
 I said tominic from Tonic 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.900
 It wants you to remember the flow, for example preemptive 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.220
 c code 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.220
 Since time 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.449
 next 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:25.830
 Well, if it were to be this way 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:28.410
 Tonic dominant and tonic substitute 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.590
 Remember that it is a minor 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.800
 It was succulent 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:41.159
 Please try this poop practice 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:46.710
 I think that there is a music score of your hand, for example 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:53.009
 Training to analyze the behavior first of all 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:58.770
 And what did you think from the meat if you analyze 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:01.040
 I understand it with my head and I feel more and more 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.650
 Do training 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.030
 As I said before , if you were a person 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.950
 Man-to-Four one-two 4 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.050
 this is 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.780
 From the donic 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:20.040
 If you went to the subdominant from the stable state 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.540
 Open-minded feeling of floating 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:32.040
 I went to a place that is not open and there is a feeling of floating 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:33.240
 In addition to the training to play while feeling that say Naa's open from where it was stable 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.009
 A little 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.810
 Reversi 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.889
 Oh 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.500
 Whether the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.900
 Oh 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.960
 hey really 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.960
 2 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.320
 Relationship 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.990
 rar 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.990
 Hmm 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.310
 me me 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:06.640
 I love you 2 minutes 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.640
 And Iyo Iaiya 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:16.860
 Come here to the Fu that'll flow has changed 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:19.340
 Be sure to analyze the code 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.340
 practice 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.360
 What 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:32.349
 It is if 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:32.349
 If the song group that you want to try is nicked and illegal 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.460
 Because I can not analyze 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.440
 First of all 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.840
 Dattari same 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.230
 More later 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.230
 I agree 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:54.830
 Music that is formed only with diatonic 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:07:00.950
 For example, Switzerland's something I think that it is recommended in the f number of units music often 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:07.710
 As soon as that in the performed try and I hope my head in 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:11.110
 By training that it is tonic or subdominant dominant 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:16.910
 Feeling of parentheses to hear from ear Oh 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:24.490
 Gonna tension drifts Akore the wonder if not a dominant 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:30.610
 We will become a very useful even when that by ear because of this seven 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:32.230
 Please think this report already well to remember this firmly and be able to use it properly 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:39.600
 It is 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:45.720
 It 's different from what I used to write a song with a code to Tekito somehow 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:48.139
 It's so because the music will continue out intention to say that I want to do this 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.440
 I think it will be a good flow 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:55.930
 Then everyone is good, but practice 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.930
 Try training to analyze
