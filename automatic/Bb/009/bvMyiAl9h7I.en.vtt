00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.879
 hello very good to all how are you 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.280
 today trovera hd welcome to a new 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.770
 video more we are with my classes 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.650
 customized to troll as you see in 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.930
 the video and come on let's go see what I 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.599
 I lose public party create a class 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.990
 As you can see here I have six classes 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.630
 customized to play normal and here 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.119
 I have the troll class worth we go to 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.789
 start with the main weapon I have 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.680
 is a rifle to run more with 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.840
 silencer in case I miss some 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 shot I want to troll with some 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.050
 shooting him a bullet because I do not 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.539
 hear, it's worth the weapon that you carry, I think 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.809
 that does not matter too much but 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.730
 always wearing the silencer is worth 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.769
 we go with the secondary since it takes a 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.770
 gun do not tell me why why not 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.990
 I usually carry the floor 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.060
 the ballistic knives to run more 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.460
 or if I do not directly remove the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.010
 secondary by pressing the square and I'm going 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.110
 with the knife that then next to 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.990
 light weight and extreme conditioning 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.300
 already reached the objectives before 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.210
 make fuzzy ninja before to lock up 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.560
 someone or you run more if it allows you to do 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.690
 many more tournaments worth we spent things 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.820
 like the jokers nothing the truth I 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.380
 maybe excess media could 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.420
 carry yes because not to carry 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.310
 a main weapon that could be a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 submachine gun and a secondary weapon that could 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 be the riot police later and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.659
 studies for when you are deactivating 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.970
 online for example that you shoot at 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.649
 the riot shield 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 Kills and allows you to do it more easily 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.560
 no and if not also the tactical double for 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.439
 carry two smoke grenades or two 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 won shocked hours or tortillera 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.740
 stunners sorry that according to taste 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.929
 ok but here of jokers 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.479
 mainly these two although not as 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.450
 You see, I do not usually take it to advantage 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.880
 1 clearly or light weight to get 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.770
 before the objectives as I said or 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.239
 bulletproof vest because if you're 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.069
 lying on the goal to make a 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.560
 ninja or something will possibly throw you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.799
 many grenades and I need it what 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.890
 you'll need forgiveness okay ghost good 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.120
 I do not know for me I liked these two vale 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.030
 Boys 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.599
 we go with the advantage 2 here pérez pérez 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:31.140
 and here I personally, no doubt 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:35.220
 Cold blood vale is quite important 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.890
 since it costs more to be detected when 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.720
 you're hiding all this I'm 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.150
 saying very generally for the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.180
 ninjas is worth but more or less it serves 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.040
 for all the others or if not 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.640
 electronic resistance but good 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.340
 Cold blood is essential and we go every 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.980
 third here we have a few come out 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.739
 tour we have you extreme conditioning 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.290
 that is we could take it off we carry 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.090
 for example light weight and a weapon that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.909
 It weighs little but good I take it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.200
 same forever to get to the first 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.780
 Tactical mask because like you 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.629
 they throw many lethal grenades at you 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.900
 tactics so you're going to need it 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.730
 surely and deadly silence clearly 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.090
 so they do not sit you down so you do not 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 listen when you approach them 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.870
 quite important also here we 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.659
 we could put 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.760
 also wildcard is a double advantage 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.319
 3 would go very well to carry 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.750
 mortal silence and 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.720
 extreme conditioning or mask 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.610
 tactic and mental silence I think it is 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.909
 quite important to assess the advantage 3 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.409
 There is a lot of variety to choose from and now 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:47.270
 let's go with the lethal one and the tactics for 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:49.730
 end of lethal here is not enough 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.710
 - climate and fragmentation because you 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.530
 you die with fragmentation and clay 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.270
 heap you note a lot the combat h 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.550
 of salt tomahawk goes very well for when 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.400
 are you trying to make the statue worth 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.930
 it's perfect you do not see anything then the 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.330
 people who are also doing very well that is the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.180
 that I've seen saw me and the c4 and the bones shin 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.340
 beth and you do not notice too much are 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.290
 both the same form almost the one that 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.560
 It gives the view is the same position and nothing 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.680
 lethal 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.200
 - fragmentation and clay mor I think that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.360
 all go well we 're left with here that 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.920
 I personally, without doubt, I take the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.380
 smoke to question the smoke when 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:33.910
 have activated the pump and do not see me or 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:37.810
 if not the stunned now the blinding 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.970
 the shocked now minus the pm and the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.370
 others are worth the black hat for 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.100
 course less in dirty tactics a less 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.530
 so well here I would take the 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.360
 blinding shocked now or grenade 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.030
 smoke but I'm left with the grenade 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.860
 smoke that is much more subtle and nothing 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.300
 guys here my classes are over 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.160
 personalized I hope that I have 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.870
 served some people had it 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.210
 asked and I for that I'm stopping 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.490
 teach them and nothing if you liked to leave 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.110
 live favorites put many comments 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.750
 I love that you comment on the videos 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.750
 or anything we see until the next
