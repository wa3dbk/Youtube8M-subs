00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
in this quick tutorial I'm going to show

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.220 
in this quick tutorial I'm going to show
you<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:11.969> transform<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.809> photos

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
you how you can transform your photos

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.450 
you how you can transform your photos
from<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.009> photo<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> photo<00:00:17.190> like

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
from a photo like this to a photo like

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.980 
from a photo like this to a photo like
this<00:00:18.260> now<00:00:19.260> there's<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.590> key<00:00:19.800> elements<00:00:19.980> to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
this now there's some key elements to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.099 
this now there's some key elements to
getting<00:00:21.990> better<00:00:22.170> photos<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:24.109> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
getting better photos like this and the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
getting better photos like this and the
first<00:00:25.350> thing<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> notice<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.880> first

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
first thing to notice is on this first

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.720 
first thing to notice is on this first
picture<00:00:27.769> I've<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.099> left<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> camera<00:00:29.640> on

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
picture I've just left the camera on

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
picture I've just left the camera on
auto<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> what's<00:00:30.929> happened<00:00:31.380> it's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
auto and this is what's happened it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.139 
auto and this is what's happened it's
chosen<00:00:32.790> quite<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> low<00:00:34.020> shutter<00:00:34.290> speed<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
chosen quite a low shutter speed and

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.340 
chosen quite a low shutter speed and
we're<00:00:36.149> getting<00:00:36.329> blurring<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> light's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
we're getting blurring and the light's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're getting blurring and the light's
not<00:00:37.559> exactly<00:00:37.980> how<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.250> want<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.790> doesn't

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
not exactly how we want it it doesn't

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.549 
not exactly how we want it it doesn't
capture<00:00:39.480> any<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> drama<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
capture any of the drama of the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
capture any of the drama of the
situation<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> composition<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
situation the kind of composition is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
situation the kind of composition is
kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> boring<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.219> wanted<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> run

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
kind of boring so I just wanted to run

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.799 
kind of boring so I just wanted to run
through<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> second<00:00:47.070> photo<00:00:47.809> now

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
through how I got the second photo now

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.920 
through how I got the second photo now
our<00:00:49.760> particular<00:00:50.760> environment<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.719> have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
our particular environment that we have

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
our particular environment that we have
this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.410> we're<00:00:52.559> dealing<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.280> just

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this is what we're dealing with we just

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.450 
this is what we're dealing with we just
had<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.850> simple<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.480> driveway

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
had a little simple little driveway

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.939 
had a little simple little driveway
situation<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.530> from<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
situation and you can see from here I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.200 
situation and you can see from here I
didn't<00:00:59.190> actually<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.609> any<00:00:59.640> pond<00:01:00.030> or

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
didn't actually have any pond or

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
didn't actually have any pond or
anything<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> foreground<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.520> real

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
anything in the foreground so the real

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.320 
anything in the foreground so the real
trick<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:04.339> place<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> camera<00:01:05.790> right<00:01:06.119> on

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
trick was I place the camera right on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
trick was I place the camera right on
the<00:01:06.510> ground<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:07.290> had<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> tripod<00:01:08.070> plate

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the ground I actually had a tripod plate

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370 
the ground I actually had a tripod plate
underneath<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.930> rest<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
underneath it so I could just rest it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
underneath it so I could just rest it
directly<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> driveway<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.720> place<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
directly on the driveway and I place the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
directly on the driveway and I place the
camera<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> position<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.790> where

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
camera in the position here where

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.789 
camera in the position here where
there's<00:01:15.450> where<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
there's where there was a bit of a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
there's where there was a bit of a
puddle<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.280> foreground<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
puddle in the foreground and what that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.399 
puddle in the foreground and what that
gave<00:01:19.409> me<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.330> ability<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> lot<00:01:22.380> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
gave me is the ability to have a lot of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
gave me is the ability to have a lot of
reflection<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.939> camera<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.270> nice

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
reflection because the camera is nice

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
reflection because the camera is nice
and<00:01:24.630> load<00:01:24.869> has<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.500> water<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and load has all this water in the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
and load has all this water in the
foreground<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
foreground and you can get that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.060 
foreground and you can get that
beautiful<00:01:28.350> reflection<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> Sun<00:01:30.240> set<00:01:31.070> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
beautiful reflection of the Sun set so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
beautiful reflection of the Sun set so
that<00:01:32.100> was<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> first<00:01:32.909> step<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.930> trick<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that was the first step the trick is to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
that was the first step the trick is to
get<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.250> unique<00:01:35.970> angle<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
get that really unique angle on a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.039 
get that really unique angle on a
relatively<00:01:37.710> mundane<00:01:38.430> scene<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.900> see

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
relatively mundane scene so you can see

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.630 
relatively mundane scene so you can see
this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.619> more<00:01:40.770> drama<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.340> we're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this is a lot more drama because we're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
this is a lot more drama because we're
having<00:01:41.820> all<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> sunset<00:01:42.600> reflected<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
having all that sunset reflected in the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.190 
having all that sunset reflected in the
water<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
water there so the first thing to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.899 
water there so the first thing to
actually<00:01:46.470> take<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> shot<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.399> side<00:01:47.610> had<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
actually take the shot one side had the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
actually take the shot one side had the
position<00:01:48.390> correct<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.829> turn<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.250> camera

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
position correct is to turn the camera

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.399 
position correct is to turn the camera
over<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.909> manual<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> reason<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.259> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
over to manual now the reason I do that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.859 
over to manual now the reason I do that
is<00:01:52.710> because<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.450> control

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is because that is you want to control

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
is because that is you want to control
how<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.170> light<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> see<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.340> want

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
how much light I see I actually want

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
how much light I see I actually want
some<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> foreground<00:01:58.020> building<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.829> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
some of the foreground building and that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.580 
some of the foreground building and that
to<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.430> silhouetted<00:02:00.079> because<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.439> want

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
to be silhouetted because I really want

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
to be silhouetted because I really want
those<00:02:01.770> rich<00:02:02.009> colors<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> sunset<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.180> come

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
those rich colors of the sunset to come

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.690 
those rich colors of the sunset to come
out<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.290> set<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.740> over<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.159> manual

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
out what I do is I set it over to manual

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.859 
out what I do is I set it over to manual
exposure<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.399> my<00:02:08.399> particular<00:02:09.030> settings<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
exposure and my particular settings that

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.420 
exposure and my particular settings that
I<00:02:09.959> used<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.940> photograph<00:02:11.940> were

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
I used in this photograph were

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.860 
I used in this photograph were
f4i<00:02:14.430> could<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.150> actually<00:02:15.300> used<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.720> much

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
f4i could have actually used a much

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.870 
f4i could have actually used a much
narrower<00:02:16.140> aperture<00:02:16.830> because<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.340> tend<00:02:17.610> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
narrower aperture because I tend it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.580 
narrower aperture because I tend it
turns<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.420> actually<00:02:18.690> rested<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> camera

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
turns out I actually rested the camera

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.310 
turns out I actually rested the camera
on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> ground<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.270> case<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.540> could

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
on the ground so in this case I could

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.980 
on the ground so in this case I could
have<00:02:22.410> taken<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.190> way<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.430> to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
have taken it all the way up to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.460 
have taken it all the way up to
something<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.430> f11<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.640> or<00:02:27.210> f-18<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
something like f11 or or f-18 to get a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
something like f11 or or f-18 to get a
much<00:02:28.680> broader<00:02:29.580> depth<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.180> field<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:30.990> was

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
much broader depth of field but I was

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.530 
much broader depth of field but I was
mostly<00:02:31.410> concerned<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.070> having<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.550> distant

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
mostly concerned of having the distant

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.360 
mostly concerned of having the distant
things<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.990> focus<00:02:34.410> side<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.070> wasn't

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
things in focus side and I wasn't

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.670 
things in focus side and I wasn't
worried<00:02:35.790> about<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.000> too<00:02:36.390> much<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.870> actually

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
worried about that too much and actually

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.850 
worried about that too much and actually
he<00:02:37.950> was<00:02:38.130> able<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.520> set<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> shutter<00:02:39.090> speed<00:02:39.510> at

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
he was able to set the shutter speed at

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.710 
he was able to set the shutter speed at
160th<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.580> once<00:02:41.880> again<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.210> could<00:02:42.450> have

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
160th and once again I could have

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
160th and once again I could have
and<00:02:42.870> set<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> lower<00:02:43.620> shutter<00:02:43.920> speed<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.520> I

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
and set a lower shutter speed because I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.070 
and set a lower shutter speed because I
actually<00:02:44.790> had<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> camera<00:02:45.330> rested<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:45.960> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
actually had the camera rested on the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.620 
actually had the camera rested on the
ground<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.130> wasn't<00:02:47.310> too<00:02:48.210> much<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
ground here so that wasn't too much of a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.160 
ground here so that wasn't too much of a
problem<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.890> ISO<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:51.030> set<00:02:51.240> at<00:02:51.360> 3<00:02:51.690> 20<00:02:51.870> in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
problem and the ISO was set at 3 20 in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.400 
problem and the ISO was set at 3 20 in
this<00:02:52.440> case<00:02:52.740> so<00:02:53.580> not<00:02:54.150> much<00:02:54.330> grain<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
this case so not much grain in the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.600 
this case so not much grain in the
photograph<00:02:55.860> because<00:02:56.040> i'm<00:02:56.250> using<00:02:56.280> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
photograph because i'm using a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.140 
photograph because i'm using a
relatively<00:02:57.030> low<00:02:57.240> ISO<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.460> push<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.030> all

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
relatively low ISO you can push it all

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.690 
relatively low ISO you can push it all
the<00:03:00.180> way<00:03:00.270> up<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.450> about<00:03:00.810> 800<00:03:01.370> without<00:03:02.370> getting

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
the way up to about 800 without getting

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.750 
the way up to about 800 without getting
too<00:03:02.820> much<00:03:02.850> green<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> tend<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> try<00:03:05.340> keep<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
too much green but I tend to try keep it

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.730 
too much green but I tend to try keep it
low<00:03:05.880> as<00:03:05.940> possible<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> case<00:03:07.560> where

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
low as possible and in the case where

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.370 
low as possible and in the case where
you<00:03:07.800> can<00:03:07.980> use<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.160> tripod<00:03:08.490> or<00:03:09.150> rest<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.900> camera

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you can use a tripod or rest the camera

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.760 
you can use a tripod or rest the camera
on<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> steady<00:03:11.610> surface<00:03:12.210> then<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.770> use

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
on a steady surface then you can use

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.400 
on a steady surface then you can use
lower<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.460> so's<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.780> doesn't<00:03:16.170> matter<00:03:16.200> if

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
lower I so's and it doesn't matter if

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.020 
lower I so's and it doesn't matter if
the<00:03:16.680> shutter<00:03:16.920> speed<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.250> longer<00:03:17.760> because

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the shutter speed is longer because

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
the shutter speed is longer because
you're<00:03:18.180> not<00:03:18.300> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.510> get<00:03:18.630> blurring<00:03:18.840> from

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
you're not going to get blurring from

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.740 
you're not going to get blurring from
movement<00:03:19.709> once<00:03:20.459> I've<00:03:20.640> taken<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.060> photograph

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
movement once I've taken that photograph

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.160 
movement once I've taken that photograph
I<00:03:22.140> took<00:03:22.730> some<00:03:23.730> test<00:03:24.000> shots<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.690> then<00:03:24.900> check

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I took some test shots and then check

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.949 
I took some test shots and then check
the<00:03:25.320> histogram<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.340> check<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.780> LCD<00:03:27.780> to

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the histogram out and check the LCD to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.640 
the histogram out and check the LCD to
make<00:03:28.110> sure<00:03:28.380> was<00:03:28.850> you're<00:03:29.850> getting<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.360> rich

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
make sure was you're getting that rich

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.740 
make sure was you're getting that rich
sky<00:03:31.650> color<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.280> take<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.520> few<00:03:32.760> shots<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
sky color so you take a few shots if the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.620 
sky color so you take a few shots if the
sky<00:03:33.990> is<00:03:34.020> getting<00:03:34.230> blown<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.860> then<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.630> change

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
sky is getting blown out then you change

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.870 
sky is getting blown out then you change
your<00:03:36.840> settings<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.100> either<00:03:38.370> increase

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
your settings you can either increase

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.780 
your settings you can either increase
the<00:03:39.300> shutter<00:03:39.480> speed<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:40.370> close<00:03:41.370> down<00:03:41.580> that

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
the shutter speed or close down that

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.430 
the shutter speed or close down that
aperture<00:03:42.060> till<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.780> right<00:03:42.959> amount

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
aperture till you get the right amount

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.850 
aperture till you get the right amount
of<00:03:43.800> light<00:03:43.980> coming<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.670> sky<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> this

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
of light coming out of the sky so this

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.770 
of light coming out of the sky so this
is<00:03:46.980> what<00:03:47.130> came<00:03:47.370> directly<00:03:48.180> out<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.480> camera

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
is what came directly out of the camera

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.860 
is what came directly out of the camera
and<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.230> brought<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.590> into<00:03:49.770> camera<00:03:50.610> rule<00:03:50.870> for

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
and I brought it into camera rule for

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.199 
and I brought it into camera rule for
photoshop<00:03:52.500> just<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.160> show<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.400> some<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
photoshop just to show you some of the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.150 
photoshop just to show you some of the
tweaks<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.660> did<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.080> from<00:03:55.950> what<00:03:56.100> I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
tweaks I did because from what I

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680 
tweaks I did because from what I
remembered<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> actual<00:03:57.180> scene<00:03:57.390> when<00:03:57.600> I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
remembered of the actual scene when I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.150 
remembered of the actual scene when I
took<00:03:57.750> photographs<00:03:58.080> as<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.650> colors<00:03:58.980> were

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
took photographs as the colors were

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.180 
took photographs as the colors were
little<00:03:59.430> richer<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.180> sky<00:04:00.480> was<00:04:00.630> a<00:04:00.690> little<00:04:00.959> bluer

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
little richer the sky was a little bluer

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.490 
little richer the sky was a little bluer
so<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.550> made<00:04:02.760> some<00:04:03.000> changes<00:04:03.270> on<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.900> file<00:04:04.140> here

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
so I made some changes on the file here

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.340 
so I made some changes on the file here
the<00:04:04.980> first<00:04:05.250> step<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.090> horizon<00:04:06.930> line<00:04:07.080> was<00:04:07.320> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
the first step is the horizon line was a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.030 
the first step is the horizon line was a
little<00:04:07.739> bit<00:04:07.890> off<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:09.140> basically<00:04:10.140> moved<00:04:10.830> in

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
little bit off so I basically moved in

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.960 
little bit off so I basically moved in
there<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:12.739> straighten<00:04:13.739> that<00:04:14.010> horizon<00:04:14.310> line

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
there and straighten that horizon line

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.909 
there and straighten that horizon line
to<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.540> way<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> want<00:04:16.020> it<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.560> was<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
to the way I want it so that was the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.099 
to the way I want it so that was the
first<00:04:17.160> step<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.760> now<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.000> have<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.540> straighter

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
first step so now we have a straighter

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.170 
first step so now we have a straighter
image<00:04:19.560> here<00:04:19.890> then<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> next<00:04:20.549> thing<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:20.970> I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
image here then the next thing is I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.370 
image here then the next thing is I
found<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.900> color<00:04:22.109> temperature

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
found that the color temperature

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.810 
found that the color temperature
originally<00:04:23.310> shot<00:04:24.060> was<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> little<00:04:24.900> bit<00:04:25.080> to

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
originally shot was a little bit to

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.440 
originally shot was a little bit to
result<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.150> little

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
result in a little

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.570 
result in a little
too<00:04:27.600> warm<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.320> should<00:04:28.620> turn<00:04:29.010> that<00:04:29.250> down<00:04:29.520> a

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
too warm so I should turn that down a

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.890 
too warm so I should turn that down a
bit<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.060> I'm<00:04:30.120> turning<00:04:30.270> down<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.690> color

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
bit so I'm turning down the color

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.290 
bit so I'm turning down the color
temperature<00:04:31.200> which<00:04:31.830> results<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.910> making<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
temperature which results in making a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.760 
temperature which results in making a
cooler<00:04:33.660> image<00:04:34.080> here<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.100> around<00:04:35.630> around<00:04:36.770> 4700

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
cooler image here so around around 4700

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.440 
cooler image here so around around 4700
is<00:04:37.860> more<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.310> what<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.610> remember<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> scene

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
is more like what I remember the scene

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.040 
is more like what I remember the scene
to<00:04:39.660> be<00:04:39.980> now<00:04:40.980> exposure<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:42.120> turn<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.750> up<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
to be now exposure I turn that up a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.870 
to be now exposure I turn that up a
little<00:04:43.230> bit<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:44.040> little<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.460> little<00:04:44.580> bit

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
little bit just a little a little bit

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.570 
little bit just a little a little bit
brighter<00:04:45.090> sky<00:04:45.720> there<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:47.010> exposure<00:04:47.370> was

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
brighter sky there so the exposure was

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.220 
brighter sky there so the exposure was
little<00:04:47.790> brighter<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.270> scene<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:48.930> turned

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
little brighter in the scene so I turned

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.800 
little brighter in the scene so I turned
that<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.710> little<00:04:49.890> and<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:51.360> turned<00:04:51.600> out<00:04:51.720> the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
that up a little and I turned out the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.810 
that up a little and I turned out the
recovery<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:52.830> we<00:04:52.950> don't<00:04:52.980> blow<00:04:53.370> out<00:04:53.580> too

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
recovery of it so we don't blow out too

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.670 
recovery of it so we don't blow out too
many<00:04:54.000> highlights<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:56.720> then<00:04:57.720> brightness<00:04:58.470> is

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
many highlights and then brightness is

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.070 
many highlights and then brightness is
looking<00:04:59.040> pretty<00:04:59.250> good<00:04:59.610> I<00:05:00.060> turned<00:05:00.840> up<00:05:00.960> the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
looking pretty good I turned up the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.450 
looking pretty good I turned up the
contrast<00:05:01.470> little<00:05:01.770> because<00:05:01.920> I<00:05:02.040> do<00:05:02.160> want<00:05:02.340> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
contrast little because I do want the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.570 
contrast little because I do want the
contrast<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.330> be<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.570> bit<00:05:03.780> stronger<00:05:04.170> in<00:05:04.590> the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
contrast to be a bit stronger in the

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.530 
contrast to be a bit stronger in the
scene<00:05:05.900> so<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.620> looks<00:05:07.860> good<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.430> then<00:05:09.300> to

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
scene so that looks good and then to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.630 
scene so that looks good and then to
just<00:05:09.750> give<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.290> colors<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:10.920> bit<00:05:11.010> more<00:05:11.250> of<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.430> pop

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
just give the colors a bit more of a pop

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.500 
just give the colors a bit more of a pop
I<00:05:11.820> just<00:05:12.000> turn<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.360> vibrance<00:05:12.870> up<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:15.060> quite

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
I just turn the vibrance up so quite

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.120 
I just turn the vibrance up so quite
high<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:16.020> can<00:05:16.170> see<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.350> really<00:05:16.800> starts

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
high you can see that really starts

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.500 
high you can see that really starts
bringing<00:05:17.370> out<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.820> Reds<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> Blues

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
bringing out the Reds and the Blues

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.890 
bringing out the Reds and the Blues
there<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:20.520> teeny<00:05:20.760> bit<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.210> saturation

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
there and a teeny bit on the saturation

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.230 
there and a teeny bit on the saturation
to<00:05:22.050> make<00:05:22.200> those<00:05:22.380> colors<00:05:22.770> saturate<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> bit<00:05:23.520> you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
to make those colors saturate a bit you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.280 
to make those colors saturate a bit you
don't<00:05:24.360> want<00:05:24.480> to<00:05:24.540> go<00:05:24.600> too<00:05:24.660> far<00:05:24.810> in<00:05:25.110> the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
don't want to go too far in the

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.960 
don't want to go too far in the
saturation<00:05:25.950> because<00:05:26.190> otherwise<00:05:26.460> things<00:05:26.820> look

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
saturation because otherwise things look

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.930 
saturation because otherwise things look
really<00:05:27.240> artificial<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.610> that's<00:05:29.610> pretty<00:05:29.820> much

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
really artificial and that's pretty much

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.150 
really artificial and that's pretty much
it<00:05:30.090> so<00:05:30.510> that's<00:05:30.780> really<00:05:31.530> improved<00:05:32.010> that

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
it so that's really improved that

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.450 
it so that's really improved that
photograph<00:05:32.790> a<00:05:33.000> lot<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.770> made<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.920> really<00:05:35.100> pop

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
photograph a lot and made it really pop

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.910 
photograph a lot and made it really pop
so<00:05:35.990> anyway<00:05:36.990> this<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.260> just<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.530> quick<00:05:37.650> tutorial

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
so anyway this is just a quick tutorial

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.520 
so anyway this is just a quick tutorial
just<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.670> show<00:05:38.850> you<00:05:38.930> how<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:39.990> can<00:05:40.260> get<00:05:40.500> a

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
just to show you how you can get a

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.560 
just to show you how you can get a
relatively<00:05:41.040> mundane<00:05:41.340> scene<00:05:41.880> basically<00:05:42.270> an

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
relatively mundane scene basically an
