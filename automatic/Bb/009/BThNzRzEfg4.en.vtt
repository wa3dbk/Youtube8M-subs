materials<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.260> mean<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.010> decent<00:00:20.720> first

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
materials but I mean it's decent first

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.990 
materials but I mean it's decent first
of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> places<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.680> here<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.490> frost<00:00:23.789> support

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.350 
wagons and junk but uh they drop claws
too<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.020> too<00:00:37.230> bad<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.620> spot<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.430> mean

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
too so it's not too bad of a spot I mean

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.670 
too so it's not too bad of a spot I mean
you're<00:00:39.480> not<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.840> tons<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.440> said

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you're not going to get tons like I said

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.920 
you're not going to get tons like I said
but<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.550> enough<00:00:41.879> i<00:00:42.090> guess<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but it's enough i guess to make it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.880 
but it's enough i guess to make it
somewhat<00:00:43.500> worth<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:44.719> it's<00:00:45.719> debatable<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.770> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
somewhat worth it it's debatable to be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
somewhat worth it it's debatable to be
honest<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:49.050> almost<00:00:49.320> just

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
honest i don't know i would almost just

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.639 
honest i don't know i would almost just
farm<00:00:50.640> something<00:00:51.059> else<00:00:51.440> by<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> vicious<00:00:53.219> claws

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
farm something else by the vicious claws

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.250

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
Barracuda farming seems like you get a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.870 
Barracuda farming seems like you get a
lot<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.200> things

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
lot of things

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.730 
lot of things
and<00:02:09.830> some<00:02:10.830> claws<00:02:11.270> but<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.300> mean<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.350> decent

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
and some claws but I mean it's decent

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and some claws but I mean it's decent
though<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:15.120> daily<00:02:15.480> farming<00:02:16.280> more<00:02:17.280> drops<00:02:17.580> is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
though the daily farming more drops is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.720 
though the daily farming more drops is
always<00:02:18.030> better<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.990> my<00:02:19.110> opinion<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.010> don't

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
always better in my opinion but I don't

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.460 
always better in my opinion but I don't
know<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.030> would<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.420> over<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.020> crossbar

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
know if I would do it over the crossbar

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.700 
know if I would do it over the crossbar
sound<00:02:22.920> area<00:02:23.130> or<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:24.140> your<00:02:25.140> mileage<00:02:25.350> may<00:02:25.530> vary

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
sound area or not your mileage may vary

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.930 
sound area or not your mileage may vary
from<00:02:26.190> mine<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.760> far<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:28.400> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.550> want<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.850> do

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
from mine so far but if you want to do

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.390 
from mine so far but if you want to do
this<00:02:30.320> method<00:02:31.320> then<00:02:31.890> you're<00:02:32.010> gonna<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> do

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this method then you're gonna have to do

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.360 
this method then you're gonna have to do
the<00:02:32.490> transmute<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.020> mystic<00:02:34.290> forge<00:02:34.590> it's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the transmute in the mystic forge it's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.670 
the transmute in the mystic forge it's
just<00:02:35.550> like<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.850> other<00:02:36.090> ones<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.540> 50<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
just like all the other ones it's 50 of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.850 
just like all the other ones it's 50 of
the<00:02:37.860> tier<00:02:38.100> 5<00:02:38.520> one<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.270> tier<00:02:39.510> 6<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.350> then

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the tier 5 one of the tier 6 and then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710 
the tier 5 one of the tier 6 and then
five<00:02:41.490> crystalline<00:02:42.120> dust<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.570> five

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
five crystalline dust and five

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.390 
five crystalline dust and five
philosopher<00:02:43.290> stones<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.240> will<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:45.600> a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
philosopher stones and that will make a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.470 
philosopher stones and that will make a
most<00:02:47.400> likely<00:02:47.790> around<00:02:48.060> five<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.430> eight<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.390> it

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
most likely around five to eight but it

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.590 
most likely around five to eight but it
can<00:02:51.660> make<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.310> but<00:02:53.310> usually<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.120> five<00:02:54.420> to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
can make more but usually I get five to

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.240 
can make more but usually I get five to
eight<00:02:54.720> those<00:02:55.350> recipes<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:59.010> about<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
eight those recipes so that's about it

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.410 
eight those recipes so that's about it
guys<00:03:00.710> act<00:03:01.710> like<00:03:01.830> i<00:03:02.010> said<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.390> your

guys act like i said if your if your
money<00:03:03.660> bags<00:03:03.990> i<00:03:04.410> would<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:04.950> get<00:03:05.190> them<00:03:05.310> off<00:03:05.460> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
money bags i would just get them off the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.010 
money bags i would just get them off the
aah<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:06.900> waste<00:03:07.140> your<00:03:07.320> time<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.700> uh<00:03:09.020> if

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you want to try to make some money while

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
you want to try to make some money while
farming<00:03:11.700> them<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.930> don't<00:03:13.050> really<00:03:13.230> want<00:03:13.500> to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
farming them you don't really want to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.950 
farming them you don't really want to
spend<00:03:13.680> 15<00:03:14.160> gold<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.660> those<00:03:15.720> two

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
spend 15 gold and it's one of those two

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.770 
spend 15 gold and it's one of those two
places<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.470> suppose<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.730> if<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.660> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
