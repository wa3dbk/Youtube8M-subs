break was going to be the lead now in
the<00:01:24.630> video<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.350> told<00:01:25.860> people<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.180> know

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the video I told people it's you know

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
the video I told people it's you know
it's<00:01:27.390> taken<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> grain<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.470> salt<00:01:28.700> it's<00:01:29.700> a

rumor you know that mean but I said in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.190 
rumor you know that mean but I said in
the<00:01:32.610> video<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.210> makes<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> sense

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
