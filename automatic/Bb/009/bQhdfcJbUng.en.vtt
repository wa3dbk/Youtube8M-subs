 now let's train ourselves in 12 that more basic 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.049
 of music and how to apply them can be applied those on the keyboard 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.259
 the first is the chain 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.820
 which face can be defined as a set of notes a menu of notes 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.729
 used by a certain culture in a historical newspaper x 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.100
 violent that the piano or on any instrument anybody can 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.429
 understood as a succession of notes 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:37.240
 we saw in previous life 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.420
 p the quality of white keys to achieve it will be a 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.170
 the swimmer 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 but then he took his own life with another one with formations of notes and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.230
 with the sounds still 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.200
 for example in the Argentine north and stairs 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.480
 of the indigenous 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.480
 that consist of two notes listen peron denied it 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.659
 it is not weird 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.039
 but the number has not yet taken a trough 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.830
 we are Peru and the sun 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.360
 a scale of exin with notes uses of the eastern urethra cultures 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.700
 ancient 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 One of them could be made but it was him 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.730
 one 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.130
 for example for a year 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.780
 They can return 1 according to the world 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.970
 a computer although there are infinite greater downloads according to each

 composer of contemporary academic culture and music 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.930
 from him he has indicated it to composers to invent his own scale 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.930
 but we are now going to base ourselves 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 the more traditional face this one can function like axis like center of the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.350
 pop culture sit 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.990
 May tonic tonic grow 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.430
 for that we define the distance between two sony or any we have already said its 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.310
 previous life that the eighth was divided into 12 equal sections 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.969
 each section but the moon before seen in the north between Unionists 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.430
 public osorio continuation

 born halftone week 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:33.929
 but the moon on May 1 natural semitones same condition means 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.609
 with white keys 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.060
 the distance between which solid any for example tower one that 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:45.230
 have a semitone possible in the midwest that allows to intersperse a 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:46.529
 third note 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.089
 it's going to be called 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.469
 Two tone red is a remy tone 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.739
 it is a tone fa sun is a tone solartys a tone 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.269
 then climbing 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.139
 greater diatonic that begins the annotated is going to be called escalation greater culla 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:11.450
 fundamental whose tonic in the note that origin to the staircase forgave and green 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.980
 i if we analyze with a little more depth 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.069
 We are going to Wye composed of two cycles of four identical notes 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.579
 do not reject isolda sidor identical because who the point not of loarre 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.129
 a tone of ready and a semitone of my afa and then return to the same cycle are

 autonomous seeding a tone isidro a sevillian 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:45.039
 This is a very natural very easy to sing iker 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.149
 as well as that recent love the epicenter I saw many musical compositions
