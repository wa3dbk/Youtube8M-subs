00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 good afternoon dear subscribers jam with 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.819
 you weight 3 and we have with you on line 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 fresh transfer 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.700
 in which I talk about some 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.950
 certain new game in which 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 really worth playing i know what 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.330
 quite a while was not us releases of this show 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.010
 but there are two reasons for this first 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 sales in the incentive because pretty 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.550
 it was difficult to track any new 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 games while steam you just 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 offered to buy some games at a discount 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.609
 but sales are over and the second 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 the reason why the transfer was not long ago 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.040
 that's what i was hoping to do fresh 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 the poor about batman pro new game 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 batman and i was hoping waiting for what she 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
 come out here I'll play in the field will take fresh 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 1 here, too, all the parts about it to me very 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 like they are all good, tell me what 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.760
 good game out someone who is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.039
 look playin cool but batman in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 the port plan has so far just failed and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.510
 he is now even banned in my opinion 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.030
 sale and it will only be available 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.469
 then when the pile is done eliminate 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.469
 normal port and only then steam 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.670
 allow users to buy it then 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.620
 There is of course in such conditions 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.870
 shoot a release every year you're talking about it and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 like cool game it's somehow a bit not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.090
 then today we are really guys 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.860
 cool game 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.119
 which is called for the black watch movie 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
 I now about you more detail 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.780
 tell you when I read the description of the game 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.000
 it made me strong 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.740
 impression she is not surprising since 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.540
 we were promised that the gameplay will be 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 unfold not only internal but 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
 and in the real world according to the plot we act 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.900
 to serve in a secret organization which 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 trying to keep order and peace in everything 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 world and gameplay is to perform 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 different missions for successful 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 the completion of which you need to solve 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.869
 and enter a code word to search for it 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.030
 we have a specific task 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.430
 for example find out someone's name solve 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 cipher sequence number and so on for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 so that we can rely on something 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.340
 give certain files related to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.930
 Let us make it clear to you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.180
 I will tell on the example of a specific case 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 its essence lies in the fact that it was gone 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.030
 a certain price of antiques and us 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.490
 need to install 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 who she is now and what 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.479
 this for things not specified and in order 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 so we can start at least something 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.329
 investigation give us the site address on 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.649
 which can encrypt and 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.229
 unscramble information using 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 various options and encodings pdf file 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.380
 in which we briefly introduce 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 existing options and ciphers 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.319
 also give an archive of photos drawing 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.760
 on which 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.980
 should and determine who is now 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.810
 stolen thing site encryption my and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.519
 some pictures it's not so thick 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.939
 agree but in one of the photos 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.019
 found a sticker with a set of letters and numbers 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.090
 obviously it was encryption 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.379
 deciphering the first line I got 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.909
 website address which is 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.189
 a specific archive where anyone can 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.409
 go in and leave a note with information 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.780
 but with the second line on the sticker was not 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.760
 so everything is just decrypted and and i got 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.980
 just a set of letters and numbers that is clearly not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.389
 contained no information 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 after some time thinking 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.739
 I thought that if the address of the site and set 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.599
 character is a single unit that is this well 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.879
 link and I was right 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.250
 going to the page I found the announcement of 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.599
 selling some manuscript and looking into 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.040
 Wikipedia, I learned that this is real 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.049
 existing manuscript with his 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.419
 real history and owners so 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.010
 the way i unraveled the matter and what 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.260
 terrific mission 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.150
 very diverse and almost always 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.549
 to search the clue has to apply 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.139
 use something new for example in 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.849
 a certain task we have to 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.829
 delve into the internet for various 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.719
 sites to collect information and somewhere 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.250
 carefully have to examine the documents a 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.379
 somewhere to apply your skills 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.599
 Photoshop works to restore the code 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.979
 indicated on the damaged photo in 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.120
 In general, what I have to do 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.040
 engage in order to get 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.470
 I would also like to mention the necessary answer 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.419
 stylish design in the game itself as well 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.579
 suitable musical accompaniment which 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.930
 perfectly immerses you in the atmosphere of the game 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.250
 Well, not to mention about 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.799
 video sequences before each mission 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.750
 which is also very atmospheric so what 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.389
 Well guys summarize the game for black 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.859
 watch man is very good, and the pros and is 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.840
 the fact that she uses information for 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.909
 real world and again the whole gameplay 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.709
 intertwined with the real component 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.470
 you need to solve some business 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.209
 delve into real-life news 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.219
 information with some kind of object which 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.109
 exists in the real world and is understandable 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.329
 do due to all this being created 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.250
 the impression is that everything that happens in 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.989
 the game is all true and all is in fact 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.659
 really happens and you really like that 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.459
 detective keepers who sits and here 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.289
 like something that is trying to find really how 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.879
 as if saving the world that is all very 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:10.310
 cool and guys such a little advice 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.489
 for those who will not then 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.440
 play better play this game in 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.959
 companies that is really better to get together 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.650
 together here under the general such attitude under 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.570
 general hung under general such communication in 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.220
 this game with the head immersed and together 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.470
 looking for something not alone 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.300
 just sit alone sometimes sit 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.040
 bored but in the company when every 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.050
 busy with his business who then I do not know 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.760
 some sort of encryption solve by 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.200
 to someoneâ€™s particular cause therefore 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.000
 did a video on the Internet looking for information 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.340
 but really there are some existing 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.860
 events and then all together so here 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.700
 together you connect the picture and finds 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.800
 the right answers 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.960

 arena black keepers detective 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.240
 investigations so which conducts and all 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.560
 looking and looking and it's really cool 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.020

 the game and you are now seeing this 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.250
 release you can say what's up today 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.570
 i'm now one cool heavy more 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.280

 say goodbye subscribe to the channel and jame 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.690
 see you in the next videos 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.690
 until
