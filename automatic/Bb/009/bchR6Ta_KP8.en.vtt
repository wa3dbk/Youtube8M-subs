after<00:00:04.319> my<00:00:04.740> talks<00:00:05.069> video<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:05.700> asked<00:00:06.120> if<00:00:06.180> I

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
after my talks video I was asked if I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.500 
after my talks video I was asked if I
will<00:00:06.540> do<00:00:06.690> one<00:00:06.930> set<00:00:07.379> up<00:00:07.560> use<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.040> them<00:00:08.220> safety<00:00:08.670> so

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
will do one set up use of them safety so

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.470 
will do one set up use of them safety so
this<00:00:09.690> video<00:00:10.080> covers<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.620> set<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.360> you<00:00:12.360> know

other things particularly things like
how<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.070> carbons<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> interesting<00:00:21.210> things

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
how do carbons of interesting things

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.140 
how do carbons of interesting things
start<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.869> happen<00:00:22.340> nonetheless<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.880> fact

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
start to happen nonetheless the fact

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.800 
start to happen nonetheless the fact
that<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.279> highly<00:00:26.279> compressed<00:00:26.789> gas<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that it is a highly compressed gas and a

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.200 
that it is a highly compressed gas and a
metal<00:00:28.109> container<00:00:28.500> does<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.519> its<00:00:29.699> risks<00:00:30.090> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
metal container does have its risks so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.889 
metal container does have its risks so
there<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:30.570> few<00:00:30.929> safety<00:00:31.230> precautions<00:00:32.360> mmm<00:00:33.390> as

off<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.480> bow<00:00:45.719> stem<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.399> did

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
off this bow stem that's what you did

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.400 
off this bow stem that's what you did
well<00:00:49.430> except<00:00:50.430> you've<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.239> 2,000<00:00:52.079> pounds<00:00:52.379> per

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
well except you've got 2,000 pounds per

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
well except you've got 2,000 pounds per
square<00:00:52.469> inch<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.039> pressure<00:00:53.100> pushing<00:00:53.760> a

hundred pound middle bottle and that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
hundred pound middle bottle and that's
enough<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.850> push<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.570> through<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
enough to push it right through the

concrete wall on people and going so the
valve<00:01:01.170> stem<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.800> protected<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> middle

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
valve stem is protected with the middle

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.510 
valve stem is protected with the middle
hat<00:01:05.390> which<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.720> should<00:01:07.080> leave<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> bottle

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
hat which you should leave on the bottle

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.359 
hat which you should leave on the bottle
in<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:09.390> time<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.900> bottle<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.530> secured<00:01:11.130> or

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
in any time the bottle is not secured or

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.929 
in any time the bottle is not secured or
Navi<00:01:11.760> needs<00:01:12.150> okay<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> let<00:01:14.070> me<00:01:14.189> show<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
Navi needs okay and let me show you that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.359 
Navi needs okay and let me show you that
I<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:17.900> on<00:01:18.900> my<00:01:21.259> banks<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> middle<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
I have on my banks the middle thing that

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.280 
I have on my banks the middle thing that
I<00:01:23.460> wrap<00:01:24.360> around<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> bottles<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.320> secure

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.920 

so<00:01:34.220> leaves<00:01:34.580> attacking<00:01:35.150> place<00:01:35.420> particularly

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
so leaves attacking place particularly

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.140 
so leaves attacking place particularly
it's<00:01:36.230> gonna<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.650> moving<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.070> bottle<00:01:37.430> from<00:01:37.880> the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
it's gonna be moving the bottle from the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.350 
it's gonna be moving the bottle from the
cap<00:01:38.390> needs<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.900> be<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.200> place<00:01:39.760> from<00:01:40.760> removing

cap needs to be in place from removing

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.720 
cap needs to be in place from removing
the<00:01:41.480> tab<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:42.470> someone's<00:01:42.950> crank<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:43.460> thing

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
the tab if someone's crank this thing

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.670 
the tab if someone's crank this thing
down<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.150> tighten<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.840> having<00:01:45.080> total<00:01:45.380> didn't

down to tighten and having total didn't

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.710 
down to tighten and having total didn't
at<00:01:45.770> all<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:47.060> place<00:01:47.240> your<00:01:47.270> wrench

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
at all then you can place your wrench

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.850 
at all then you can place your wrench
and<00:01:48.080> tap<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.620> along<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.190> thread<00:01:49.460> area

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and tap it right along the thread area

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.060 
and tap it right along the thread area
as<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.430> unscrew<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> bracelet<00:01:53.390> loop<00:01:54.070> do

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
as you unscrew it the bracelet loop do

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.620 
as you unscrew it the bracelet loop do
not<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.690> know<00:01:56.900> re<00:01:57.830> people<00:01:58.190> do<00:01:58.490> not<00:01:58.730> use<00:01:59.210> all

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
not you know re people do not use all

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.870 
not you know re people do not use all
the<00:01:59.690> grease<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.770> place<00:02:01.100> probably<00:02:01.640> didn't

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the grease on the place probably didn't

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.010 
the grease on the place probably didn't
loose<00:02:02.030> more<00:02:02.840> about<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.260> adjustment<00:02:08.020> now

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
loose more about that adjustment now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.810 
loose more about that adjustment now

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
when you're replacing the tag go ahead

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.810
