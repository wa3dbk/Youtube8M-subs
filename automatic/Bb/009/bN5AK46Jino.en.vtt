00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 everybody cavalry with you Kirill Serov 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.480
 last time I did a small surveyor 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 on one anime game lichku 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.190
 his not this thing so I liked it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 decided to continue without inventing anything 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 more original called it all 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 disgrace stupid 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.140
 not gaming power by the way who can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.420
 any better name come up well if 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.730
 yes then write your options in the comments 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 so here in these releases I will 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 tell you about any 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.860
 I found anime games that I 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
 liked 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.710
 and no matter what type it will be games 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.440
 the main thing that they are powerful and today I 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.420
 tell and show a game called 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.360
 animo blitz show 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.789
 yes this game vk but do not rush doing 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 dissatisfied with the mass in this case 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.250
 very well, I thought that you would not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 no one really cool game but 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 you have to change your mind after 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.110
 how do you find such 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.409
 like this game on the one hand is very 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 just the other way 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.409
 brilliant it is the simplest and I still 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.840
 I can't understand why nobody used to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.170
 did not like this small 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.259
 prehistory i always thought what a pity that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.630
 There is no such thing when saw and even 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.210
 sometimes participated in all sorts of anime 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.430
 quizzes in all sorts of anime groups 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.470
 the meaning of all these quizzes is always the same 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.659
 admin puts a frame on the wall from 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.380
 any of them but participants must 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 to guess 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 and write in the comments from which anime 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.640
 this frame but such quizzes are 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.759
 quite rarely and not always 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 there is an opportunity and time to play 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.030
 then when they are held and in general 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.399
 To be honest, all this is not very convenient 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 income go to the game itself this game by 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.180
 essence represents 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.390
 anima quiz but with a huge pile 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.479
 all sorts of buns and bonuses and most importantly 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 that you can play with her friends 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.649
 there is a battle 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.660
 11 I mean the function of the duel yes yes extort 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.820
 kick his friend with him 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.490
 nude ass showing that you understand 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.430
 taking out his cooler well or he can 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 kick your ass this way but so 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.130
 how this game just came out in 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.830
 shine 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.770
 there are not too many players in it yet 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.380
 and you will be the first to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.070
 rate it so invite everyone 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.380
 his friends not to nick the mouse to complete 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.780
 Naturally in this game there is a single 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.140
 the mode in which you can pump over 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.200
 and get levels and scores have experience points 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.360
 there is energy needed for games just like 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.030
 in a full-fledged online game 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.130
 in this game there is a shop in which 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.200
 You can buy for points earned 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.260
 quiz all sorts of bonuses and nishtyaki 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.760
 who really make the game more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.770
 interesting for example 50 to 50 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.020
 extra time or even about 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.840
 adder responses of other players 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.300
 but still in this shop some 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.280
 nishtyaki you can buy started savaco but 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.780
 we all know about contact currency in 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.330
 you just go here 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.459
 buy premium gaming currency any 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.980
 convenient way and flow for this currency 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.200
 you can take even more cool bonuses 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.130
 such as charging acceleration or docking 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.560
 cell I have no right of course to call 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.320
 I want to buy all this and do not want to call 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.750
 just note buying just a couple 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.580
 nishtyakov for a very conditional amount to 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.260
 now with this money even on the metro one 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.480
 just do not drive so now buying 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.430
 a couple of bonuses first for you 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.340
 it will be much more interesting to play 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.420
 secondly sim actions you very much 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 help the project 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.380
 the game is completely new and it is already quite 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.770
 cool 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.150
 but with time as the number of players grows 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.790
 game creators promise all sorts of 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.150
 improvements new modes and a whole bunch 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.489
 things so guys that do 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.560
 don't have any sponsors or 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.570
 great financial help to create 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.690
 games but believe to make even 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.550
 a seemingly simple ordinary game 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.459
 a person needs to spend just a bunch 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.770
 time effort and even money and if 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.989
 the project will not get returns then he 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.510
 tritely can stop developing and 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.450
 very close personally, I bought 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.870
 several bonuses thereby making 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.270
 tiny contribution to the development of the project 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.360
 which I really like the link to 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.060
 the game itself, I certainly leave immediately under 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.490
 this video in the description just go to 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.070
 group of the game by clicking on this button 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.729
 write your comments and comments there 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.630
 wishes about this game 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.030
 developers really it will be 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.729
 interesting and important to know to make 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.240
 the game is much better for us 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.190
 well and no damn it was not an advertisement what 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.229
 Well, in all advertising you see this game 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.930
 I really liked it and I 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.389
 I play it periodically yes and even if 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.910
 would it be straight advertising 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.490
 so what the blinsky difference is the essence of 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.039
 this does not change and thank you all for 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.470
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.979
 video and my idea of doing reviews on it and 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.050
 games 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.789
