00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's not I mean I wouldn't say it's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
it's not I mean I wouldn't say it's
ombre<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> wouldn't<00:01:54.479> say<00:01:54.719> it's<00:01:55.079> completely

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
ombre and I wouldn't say it's completely

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.830 
ombre and I wouldn't say it's completely
like<00:01:56.130> brown<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.939> blonde<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
like brown or blonde it just is a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
like brown or blonde it just is a
mixture<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.829> looks<00:01:59.009> nice<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.249> i

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
mixture and it just looks nice and i

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.480 
mixture and it just looks nice and i
think<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.539> for<00:02:01.109> me<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.350> least<00:02:01.380> works<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.429> much

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
think this for me at least works so much

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.520 
think this for me at least works so much
better<00:02:02.609> than<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.359> completely<00:02:03.960> bleached<00:02:04.289> out

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
better than like completely bleached out

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.270 
better than like completely bleached out
so<00:02:04.920> anyways<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.179> what<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.770> asked<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
so anyways that is what i asked and that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.400 
so anyways that is what i asked and that

just works a lot better um and
especially<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.600> fall<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.050> know<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:54.290> fun<00:02:54.500> to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
especially for fall you know it's fun to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.650 
especially for fall you know it's fun to
kind<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.860> go<00:02:55.010> over<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> darker<00:02:55.700> for<00:02:55.880> fall<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
kind of go over the darker for fall the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.030 
kind of go over the darker for fall the
other<00:02:56.840> thing<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.140> if<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.440> can<00:02:57.650> tell<00:02:58.010> a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
other thing is if you can tell a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.710 
other thing is if you can tell a
difference<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:58.760> because<00:02:59.090> she<00:02:59.330> told<00:02:59.570> me

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
difference that's because she told me

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.220 
difference that's because she told me
that<00:03:00.070> most<00:03:01.070> patients<00:03:01.280> patients<00:03:02.090> clients<00:03:02.840> they

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that most patients patients clients they

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.720 
that most patients patients clients they
guess<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.470> better<00:03:03.590> word<00:03:03.860> when<00:03:04.310> they<00:03:04.400> come<00:03:04.610> in

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
guess is better word when they come in

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.730 
guess is better word when they come in
to<00:03:04.880> go<00:03:05.150> from<00:03:05.480> lighter<00:03:05.810> hair<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.260> darker<00:03:06.560> hair

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
to go from lighter hair to darker hair

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.890 
to go from lighter hair to darker hair
she<00:03:07.310> doesn't<00:03:07.340> more<00:03:07.790> gradually<00:03:08.360> because<00:03:08.690> if

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
she doesn't more gradually because if

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.840 
she doesn't more gradually because if
you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.620> have<00:03:09.890> platinum<00:03:10.250> blonde<00:03:10.700> hair

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
you know you have platinum blonde hair

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.490 
you know you have platinum blonde hair

she<00:03:17.209> just<00:03:17.330> said<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:17.720> she<00:03:17.989> likes<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.290> put<00:03:18.500> in

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
she just said that she likes to put in

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.259 
she just said that she likes to put in
low<00:03:18.950> lights<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.760> work<00:03:20.000> her<00:03:20.239> way

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
low lights and kind of work her way

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.780 
low lights and kind of work her way
slowly<00:03:21.170> so<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.620> can<00:03:21.709> kind<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:22.010> get<00:03:22.400> exactly

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
slowly so you can kind of get exactly

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.340 
slowly so you can kind of get exactly
what<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.090> want<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.510> don't<00:03:23.570> go<00:03:23.870> too<00:03:24.110> dark

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
what you want and you don't go too dark

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.110 
what you want and you don't go too dark
or<00:03:24.470> too<00:03:24.530> light<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.550> can<00:03:25.670> always<00:03:25.940> add<00:03:26.090> more

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
or too light and you can always add more

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.850 
or too light and you can always add more
but<00:03:26.510> it's<00:03:26.600> really<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:27.019> lot<00:03:27.230> harder<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.709> like

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
but it's really a lot harder to like

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.340 
but it's really a lot harder to like
take<00:03:28.040> away<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.820> lowlights<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.989> was<00:03:30.140> her

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
take away the lowlights so that was her

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.690 
take away the lowlights so that was her
theory<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:30.980> I'm<00:03:31.040> probably<00:03:31.220> gonna<00:03:31.370> go<00:03:31.550> back

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
theory and I'm probably gonna go back

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.460 
theory and I'm probably gonna go back
and<00:03:31.730> about<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.209> month<00:03:32.600> or<00:03:32.720> two<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.140> just<00:03:33.200> get<00:03:33.440> a

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
and about a month or two and just get a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.880 
and about a month or two and just get a
few<00:03:33.709> more<00:03:33.980> um<00:03:34.250> low<00:03:35.000> lights<00:03:35.269> put<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.769> then

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
few more um low lights put in and then

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.410 
few more um low lights put in and then
if<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.400> she<00:03:37.820> didn't<00:03:38.000> put<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.150> few

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
if you can see she didn't put a few

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.850 
if you can see she didn't put a few
