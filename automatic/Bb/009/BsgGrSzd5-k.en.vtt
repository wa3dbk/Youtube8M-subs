reason<00:03:55.359> they<00:03:55.569> are<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:55.690> good<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.230> dispersed<00:03:56.950> off

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
reason they are so good is dispersed off

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.770 
reason they are so good is dispersed off
the<00:03:57.940> oh<00:03:58.380> drama<00:03:59.380> country<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.370> allows<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:01.510> to

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
automatically have a thousand for each

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.009 
automatically have a thousand for each
of<00:04:03.730> these<00:04:03.850> plus<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:04.569> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> weaken<00:04:04.930> your

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
of these plus it's going to weaken your

of these plus it's going to weaken your
poems<00:04:05.290> monsters<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.920> then<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.400> also<00:04:06.549> run<00:04:06.880> 3

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
poems monsters and then you also run 3

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.870 
poems monsters and then you also run 3
solidarity<00:04:08.230> which<00:04:08.769> means<00:04:09.040> if<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.430> have<00:04:09.609> all

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
solidarity which means if you have all

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.190 
solidarity which means if you have all
the<00:04:10.150> same<00:04:10.269> type<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.540> monster<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.139> the

the same type of monster in the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.340 
the same type of monster in the
graveyard<00:04:11.380> then<00:04:12.100> your<00:04:13.079> monsters<00:04:14.079> are<00:04:14.230> going

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
graveyard then your monsters are going

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.590 
graveyard then your monsters are going
to<00:04:14.530> gain<00:04:14.680> 800<00:04:14.980> each<00:04:15.579> so<00:04:16.209> for<00:04:16.359> each<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.539> these

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
to gain 800 each so for each of these

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.789 
to gain 800 each so for each of these
you<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.019> field<00:04:17.139> they're<00:04:17.590> going<00:04:17.709> to

you have on the field they're going to

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.279 
you have on the field they're going to
gain<00:04:17.889> 800<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.000> one<00:04:19.389> of<00:04:19.419> these<00:04:19.539> automatically

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
gain 800 so one of these automatically

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.599 
gain 800 so one of these automatically
makes<00:04:20.440> these<00:04:20.560> all<00:04:20.680> 1800s<00:04:21.250> while<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.459> have<00:04:21.579> a
