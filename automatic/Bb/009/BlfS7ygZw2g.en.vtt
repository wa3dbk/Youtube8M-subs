like Rishi try it but you can go even
further<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.400> that's<00:02:21.580> where<00:02:21.849> longevity<00:02:22.240> in

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
further and that's where longevity in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.510 
further and that's where longevity in
the<00:02:22.540> bottle<00:02:22.810> comes<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:23.890> where<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.310> get

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the bottle comes in that's where you get

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.490 
the bottle comes in that's where you get
an<00:02:24.760> extraction<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.660> superior<00:02:26.110> than<00:02:26.380> it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
an extraction that is superior than it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.949 
an extraction that is superior than it
si<00:02:26.680> si<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.430> only<00:02:27.610> take<00:02:27.880> out<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.450> much<00:02:28.660> of

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
si si you can only take out so much of
