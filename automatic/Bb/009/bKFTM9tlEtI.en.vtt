00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 stop if I make a video on this game 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.529
 it's because I do not have internet 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.089
 so I can not downloaded from game is 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.280
 the only game I have on my computer and that 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.010
 I did not make videos these days 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 these patients 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.190
 suddenly bah left is what we 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.230
 choosing the quality of 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 graphics is that it's a joke 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 I prefer to play with beautiful 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.119
 graphics a simulation game of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.750
 toilet still that we are 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.750
 really feels the sensation 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.600
 so yeah you so that's you help 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.900
 for fans for men and for the disabled 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.460
 3en to super again a kind of noises 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.930
 of water is either the pipe or we who 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.670
 okay so this man can do the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.050
 breakdance with who put themselves on the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.570
 head falling on him does it on the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.250
 toilet where we are small we are quotas 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.640
 so what else in this super 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.750
 bathroom 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.129
 good already it's a little creepy because we have 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.660
 just an old ceiling lamp kit 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.830
 says you're not in the dark thanks to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.030
 it seems to me that in 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.280
 all the toilets that's how it is yes 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.530
 so I've never seen a toilet 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 public with a floor as perfect as 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.800
 it's shining it's shining it's not 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.040
 possible 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.659
 so either it's very clean or it's 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.880
 so there this man will never be stuck 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.770
 of peace that a name down can be good 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.000
 apart from that can we play on 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:20.450
 can just turn on do the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 breakdance on note on a bowl where 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.270
 zac is today the kaka dance in 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.270
 the flora is gone 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.880
 what are we doing here 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.290
 I would like to know why 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210
 was only plays I regret is already 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 now let's give a name to each of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 his facts to the I refrain from farting 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.820
 for minutes keeps me from doing 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.190
 few minutes nobody has ever 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.670
 do this to the toilet person it's not 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.590
 possible 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:05.009
 I have something more that's a style 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 dance somehow to aa 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.330
 and now the elections 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.739
 presidential elections 2014 voted one for the t2 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.820
 for and voted three for that but hurting 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.320
 comfortable doing videos on a game 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.989
 like that yes I rather agree 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.160
 mail benefits of this man and that he 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.380
 can flush with his 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.470
 teeth that's how 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.380
 here is it still necessary that she walk the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.450
 flush and he can also look 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.640
 between her legs her penis exile 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.019
 existing forgiveness that's how it's 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 he has no legs or penis maybe 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.540
 that in fact it's a flying head on 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.280
 shave on not saying no that no and this 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.830
 that she does there is that there is an end 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.940
 this game is and what this fucking bruno 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.400
 that makes me want to piss since 20 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.989
 minutes that stop the attentions 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.989
 it was a 360 p 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.379
 but what came out the facts 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:12.939
 this is 2014 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:14.409
 but this is too long too much what is 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.920
 the difference between a peace without 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.290
 glasses and 1p with glasses 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.159
 [Music] 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.109

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.280
