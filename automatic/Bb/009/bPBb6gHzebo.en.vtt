00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.940
 Welcome to Meppen 2 TÃ¼rk Sport Brodbeck TIFF Macklem 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.530
 Today we will show you Reamonn 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.519
 a monitor can be created with it 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.010
 where the monitor shows what the camera is watching 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.429
 I have prepared something there and indeed two rooms around a Rome monitor 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.780
 the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 and position in the other Bernd Kammerer 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.090
 Zong 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.270
 the steam on our object the table go with a hot topic Metelen 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.350
 objects 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.720
 Percent point and Dolce picture over this render that like that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 of course, see 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 Of course we just drive with monitor 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.430
 and her income creates a Porsche the big one like this year's monitor 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.400
 cover completely with their engine textures 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.890
 and on the front part Topcu the monitor should be displayed 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.550
 Let's make an extra texture 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.800
 intel-chips wants to go crumbs 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.830
 Bruce 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.200
 and Adam and kidnapped monitor 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.830
 if we did that if we had multiple monitors to choose from 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.380
 just by 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.000
 the guest 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.080
 Of course you can also take others 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 when I rained off it rained 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.800
 so that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.300
 Percent yes 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.790
 Institut Prof now at Kind become our industry 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.480
 So the monitor 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.230
 Part 2 ends 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.180
 Of course, the monitor is interested in Nimke Frank 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.010
 without a goal 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.789
 as the name implies 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.589
 Roeser honorable is having dollars 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.589
 Of course, we'll put the monitor on 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.349
 now among comrades have given hint 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 go 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.249
 I like to give birth 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.099
 trier 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.369
 so and of course percent 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.329
 must they 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.899
 DUP the start of the saber tournament 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.859
 Stamp on 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.939
 remains 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.490
 Breil percent when the game starts Solid, it should also 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.240
 So of course the monitor should also take states and processes so the camera 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 needs for it 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.179
 with it and points to camera access 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.299
 that does not mean camera he should display 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.559
 Most recently, Apple Inc 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:09.249
 Solz am 8 now the monitor already finished there are of course in others 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.279
 Space monitors camera is 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:13.789
 senseless 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.149
 Because of that, because of about as always, so opposite 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.899
 I just made it easier 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.059
 Percent e 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.320
 Gebert 2 Prof 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.410
 and percent I have already selected the front camera but you can 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.840
 It also of course easy to select IT myself here on the right 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.830
 to accompany the podium Auen Pohl there and then get under 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.669
 Parque del creates more on the hand 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.149
 Polt Kamerad explains Prof 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.939
 the last one kicked old because we are limping the camera Hamburg I do that I am 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.689
 always still 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.290
 you can not position euro here expensive I just go against the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.709
 wall 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.949
 just here on the wall 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.949
 and the foundation then teachers 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.669
 next to the reason 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.170
 Chamber 4 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.170
 have to 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:11.229
 Since that is a bit too high Percent on you have to stop the camera so always 

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.219
 to take what comes 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.569
 of course, now there is no jolt Rome 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.039
 I just do it as Alonso 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.680
 Of course you can also go to Process Menu from the camera 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.909
 and I like to hire extra 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:30.460
 last was 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.530
 Percent Pitsch 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.449
 gate 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.210
 throws overboard 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.879
 friend 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:40.150
 With these and Market just the table so climbed the table and Desire 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:41.960
 z and that automatically 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.379
 on the table so he's time 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.569
 I moved to 4 table 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.569
 So what I want to say he now shows automatically on the table 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.580
 now, of course, that percent is important and the name otherwise knows 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.669
 the monitor-like chamber 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.909
 because go 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.909
 who like the little ones, of course, in detail 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.339
 Happy 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.339
 so now i one click 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.169
 finished and you can copy the more it just painters because they have now 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.189
 Percent on 4 monitoring 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.400
 Camera are displayed 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.400
 Please think here is about 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.180
 it can be the whole world 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.729
 even a camera image can be displayed simultaneously it could be kidney 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.380
 Cameras and monitor exist but can represent a chamber 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.569
 so that users can finish the workshops and be done 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.789
 I wish you much fun in the replica
