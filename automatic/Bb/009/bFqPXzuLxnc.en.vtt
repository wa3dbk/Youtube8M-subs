00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.040
 Now we are starting to vyvyazyvaniya ears 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.310
 in order to tie 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.099
 we need ears on pink needles 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:22.679
 color in my case we dial 22 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.159
 loops and the first row we knit out 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.999
 Here we are with you one row 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:33.300
 inside out 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:44.010
 and now we have to enter our yellow 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:50.990
 thread here and so take our yellow thread 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:54.110
 and we enter our usual way and 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.630
 knit 6 rows 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:03.210
 facial and purl ie stocking 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:08.670
 viscous so that we have 6 liters so we will 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.299
 as usual tail I tie in the very 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.299
 knitting 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.820
 so well and so on 6 rows we need 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:33.680
 the rule is humane and so here we are tied 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:39.799
 with you 6 rows of stocking and now 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.190
 back change the thread to pink and 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.890
 knit 2 rows yet 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:53.729
 front and back loops close 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:56.580
 The thread is cut and form the ear so I 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.569
 closed loop here our five 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.810
 the last 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:05.580
 I do not pull it as we now 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:11.250
 it is necessary so this yellow thread 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:17.959
 in my case it can be cut off all unnecessary 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:22.170
 we remove here and now we need 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.310
 up to a rectangle stitch like this 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.579
 In the way these all strings I usually in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.220
 I sew inwards like this 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:38.840
 the way we sew can be crocheted 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.739
 can we can sew as you like 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.180
 how much easier for us 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:52.019
 first here and here to sew it and then we 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.230
 this is how the hall comes to life and we are already passing 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.310
 here it can be done by the way one 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.299
 right here right away that is don't stitch right 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.660
 Yeah so here it can be neatly all 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.660
 mark here so bend neatly 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:21.120
 and walk neatly and then you 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.330
 it turns out that's the ear and so 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.990
 let's get started so I'll hook 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:34.010
 you connect as you like and so I 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:39.030
 stretched my loops and starting to connect 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:43.080
 slowly I connect neatly 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:52.769
 connecting bars in each 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:57.269
 catching up here and here and so 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:06.860
 way we need to connect the entire length 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:08.040
 and so here I connected ours 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.489
 rectangle 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.489
 all the strings all the tails I was knitting then 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:20.669
 long ago that they would not disturb us 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.600
 now we need to do here 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.450
 so much to 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.460
 what we do bio will do the same 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.530
 the thing that is here is my loop 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.979
 I didn't pull out the last ones either, but I 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.080
 I pass now you consider the same 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.590
 we connect rectangles only in 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.440
 folded here these catch 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:45.380
 eyelets and connect 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.260
 You can of course do it with a needle 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 neatly sew all of you and then not 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.860
 such a little bit will be formed 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:00.140
 rude shevchik rim I do so in 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.140
 In principle, it is not particularly noticeable on the booties 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.520
 so 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.520
 not scary 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:26.099
 I connect as always with connecting 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:28.500
 to pick up here in a loop 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:32.969
 to secure our last thread 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.159
 so here I am now tied a thread 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:39.870
 I cut off 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:43.199
 look here we got it 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.759
 window on this side you know not even 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:50.159
 very rude shevchik turns he 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.139
 especially not noticeable will be ie 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.610
 the ear turns out to booties will belly 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:06:02.279
 so here therefore decide 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.479
 from behind it will not be very noticeable but all 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.639
 try to do everything equally 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.419
 neatly and so here is our gun 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.069
 ready 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:14.279
 we need four such ears 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:20.159
 together with the 4 because we have to be 2 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:26.389
 thread on each bootie two ears here 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:32.729
 and then you can embroider the spout here and 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:36.839
 glue eyes here such here 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:40.259
 somehow but for now let me show you 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.889
 Now I will finish with you too 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.740
 all of you 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:47.580
 and see the end result for you girls 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:52.919
 I want to show you I sewed ears and here 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:07:02.479
 so here you should have them left 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:07:02.479
 embroider wears glue eyes like this and 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:12.700
 here somehow that 's just not very 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.810
 you can make eyes spout and be so 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.680
 charming girl 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:21.310
 you can leave so 2 you knit a thread 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.960
 similar to the first to all thanks who was 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:29.160
 with me who watched my video 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.160
 who liked the lesson and see you later
