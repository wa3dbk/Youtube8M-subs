00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello friends means how to do 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.230
 quick scrambled eggs i think that not many are about 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 I know this personally I honestly say 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 i'm 32 years old now i'm already an old man 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.890
 an adult and I found out about this garbage 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 I literally don't know where a year ago maybe 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.890
 a half I learned about this possibility 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 there is not sorry just on this very 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.300
 on the plate to scrambled eggs well how would it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 hemorrhoids a whole that is, you need a pan 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 so that it was necessary to wait for it all 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.840
 but the very process of such a fucking well here and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 much simpler that means 5 whipped 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 set as it broke on a plate and it means 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.870
 we bring the whole thing 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.370
 microwave q and actually set 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 here and gently just trying to do 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.920
 because almost like a plate 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.510
 shallow could spill out means and and 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 then we put on how much is there permissible on 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 three and a half minutes, here's 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.150
 I look forward to waiting for a friend and will in general 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 principle like ordinary scrambled eggs 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 the only thing i don't like about it 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 the fact that there she is some kind of dry 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 too it turns out that is, if we allow 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.479
 usually take scrambled eggs to compare 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 which will be well that you can fry 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.000
 on on this very one on the slab thats there all 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 but somehow not as dry again as 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680
 I don’t know what it’s all about 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 I like very much as if whites and yolks are not 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 I really like want but also otrara 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 tomorrow depends on how I always loved 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.210
 Chicks as if from childhood is still young and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.579
 so I always try for more 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.920
 proteins vytsepit and as it is 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.299
 break an egg and wait these two shells with 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.790
 boxes that turn out 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.159
 I'm holding my hobby for a long, long time 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.700
 potryasyvaet slowly and then all of these 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.700
 bowels 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.570
 This is the very shell to all this whole 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.720
 the protein has merged more here 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.180
 how would that in general and we pan 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.409
 as if there is oil in the first place need to 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 second again this whole process 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.910
 we need to turn over there will burn no 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 burns as if, and here without any problems 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.140
 Ie, and quickly moonshine quickly and conveniently 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.140
 true then kh plate is obtained in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.170
 it turns out as if it sticks 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.610
 as if scrambled eggs but not much if if 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 I want to eat this well 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.260
 work with a spoon there tell me you are afraid 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.750
 all you can dish and everything is normal 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.130
 there will be so many there passed us 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:40.520
 how much time we have 2 minutes left 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.980
 wait stronger plan did mean bye 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.660
 let it be done for such a boxer 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.140
 I damn I do not know what to do today 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.380
 I did a review on the iphone 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.480
 rechargeable battery that's 30 thousand 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.950
 mile capacity and i mean barely in 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.190
 found information on the internet about that 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.200
 what is the most about how much 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.050
 the battery capacity of it to whom it is 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.549
 iphone 4s I found something like that 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.860
 some baryg on the internet sells 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.930
 battery as it would have to replace both 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.570
 regular batteries iphone battery and 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.549
 replace with the one that is generally well, just 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.350
 on a log like on a third-party and here 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.260
 her capacity says what type 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.209
 1430 milliamperes native battery capacity 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.430
 hour u so barely i have our information 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.269
 fuck it all so secret fuck 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.299
 can it not be 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.610
 bitch write nowhere and in general that's what 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:32.000
 you I stepped and made a video and I 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.320
 believed that 1430 is a type of consumption and I 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.019
 there is a kind person in the comments 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.299
 This is the capacity of the battery but not the expense 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.040
 and really, too, I like so hem 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.290
 fuck that is, there are all sorts of 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.170
 miniature video camera as if all 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.329
 there I don’t know gadgets that have devices 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.900
 energy consumption there I don't know 120 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.420
 150 milliamps per hour here at this iPhone 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.430
 I think fucked me already 1430 me honest 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.230
 Saying, I didn’t think much about taking it off 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.709
 vidyuhi happened that I calculated from 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.440
 30,000 divided by 1430 turned out almost 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 21 I think fucking at 21:00 okay dick with 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.540
 by him 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.940
 although here it is the eye they now extend 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.670
 capacity but battery life 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.520
 services 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.170
 It is extremely charging from the network , and now 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
 I’m starting to wonder what it is 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.590
 need to look for info boredom goes 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.200
 power consumption 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.150
 and that's how many damn five minutes 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.730
 I climbed somewhere and nowhere else 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.130
 schap is not written that is, I understand of course 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.389
 that iphone and people who buy though 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.300
 about anything bathe nothing 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.610
 to think about hammering so 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.620
 scrambled eggs explode this button is about the stairs 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.210
 it smells powerful such explosions were but I 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.979
 I think you heard someone once long 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.710
 such deaf blasts or 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.120
 Here, but in principle, it is very important shorter about 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.650
 batteries, I said very much 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.750
 can search for info in comments 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.760
 write if anyone knows this here 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.180
 scrambled eggs turned out very nice 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.240
 Here I usually yolks them as if to 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.460
 pulled out so that they are not like I'm a fan 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.860
 want aesthetically looking very beautiful 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.290
 yes it is called when the sunny side pillars 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.840
 these roundels but now I didn’t bother them 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:12.419
 once rattled up 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.919
 exploded maybe here but very 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.080
 very nice way so 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.000
 delicious four points so once 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.590
 plastic plates like this 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.600
 plastic raja plate and such 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.990
 yellow and white scrambled eggs are very cool i will 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.880
 eat and and powerfully you will be glad as usual 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.110
