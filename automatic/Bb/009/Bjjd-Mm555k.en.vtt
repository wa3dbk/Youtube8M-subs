00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.410
 good morning I'm Gianni Addonizio of 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.760
 restaurant the truffle of revere in 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.860
 province of Mantua 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.050
 today we prepare an artichoke salad 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.180
 and Sardinian pecorino 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.130
 the ingredients for 4 people are two 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.820
 artichokes 200 g of Sardinian pecorino a little 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.320
 Speck oil salt pepper tools 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.550
 to make this dish are 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.670
 quite simple 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.300
 the only one is the crepera we use 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.280
 let's go for the pecorino basket 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 to prepare our own basket 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.530
 will then be used to hold the salad 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.960
 put the grated pecorino 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 in the acre piera 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.770
 let it melt and then we do it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.320
 cool down and don't let it overturn in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.120
 our mold to give it the shape 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 if we didn't have a stencil we could 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 use an inverted cup a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.300
 glass and let it cool 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.220
 in the meantime we prepare the artichokes 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:23.160
 eliminating all the toughest leaves e 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:35.670
 thorny and we're going to use only the 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:39.360
 julienne cut heart we put it in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:47.930
 a bowl and the same we do with 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 the pecorino cheese we break the pecorino 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.369
 we combine the pecorino with our artichokes 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.330
 add a little speck 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.350
 previously cut into julienne e 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.179
 he too and we season with salt oil and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
 pepper 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.490
 in this dish with the oil it is necessary 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 be generous enough because 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.090
 raw artichoke tends to absorb a lot 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.090
 and it is a little dry 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.250
 we mix well we can also leave 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.350
 rest a few minutes right 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.680
 flavor and in the meantime prepare 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:38.879

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:41.320
