00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 today we are going to talk about the movie the 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.670
 clan that had to think a presentation 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.460
 a little more fun more dynamic but 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 it seems to me that I did not give the truth 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.349
 because fuck with certain things like that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.349
 it's fine it was not very funny 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.940
 to be welcome this is clouds here 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.160
 coming from the cinema so it occurred to me 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.210
 make the criticism really cool without thinking 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.770
 a lot to make it more natural 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.020
 possible is not that we are going to criticize today 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.720
 the clan is an Argentine film the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.120
 just recently opened clan it expected 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 a lot of the movie 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.780
 I'm the whore who gave birth only for 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.230
 want on floor now I will see is a 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 bit 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.450
 good for those who do not know or that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.820
 will treat the film by recording the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.150
 movie is going to show us the story of 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.340
 a family a normal family of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.460
 argentina upper middle class we could 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.509
 say that he had an internship 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.400
 not usual and not since the boss the 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:12.619
 father of the family was the boss of a 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.930
 band of kidnappers of which 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.630
 the family also participated not 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.160
 basically that's what the movie is about 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.619
 it's a real story it 's a story 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.140
 true what happened and that's what 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.930
 it makes the truth very entertaining beyond 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.160
 of the small ones of those mini but if 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.150
 it means because the movie 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.760
 basically it's about the movie 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.590
 it seemed to me and I expected it to be something 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.100
 much more mainly by the actors 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.560
 for the story if it's a real case like that 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.170
 I expected a lot more from the movie 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.570
 I do not blame the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.670
 story itself but to what the director 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.430
 he wanted to show with the movie maybe not 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.010
 you would expect the movie to have a 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.970
 little more action is almost a police 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.040
 you can say 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.420
 with the theme of these kidnappings and 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 that kind of thing we would expect it to be 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.260
 a little more linear than that but without 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.230
 However, the director wanted to show us 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.470
 I understand in my eyes what the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.900
 family nucleus is not of these 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.850
 people in a typical family but 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.780
 atypical at the same time not then is 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.970
 how are we constantly being 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.740
 navigating the psychology of the family 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.440
 how was the family nucleus how was the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.060
 relationship between each of the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.940
 members of this family and good this 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.740
 fight of the good and the bad that they had 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.470
 some members that if they 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.930
 did was right they are wrong participated 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.020
 towards good eyesight this guy 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.730
 things that I think makes it a bit 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.010
 slow and me when I'm looking at a 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.930
 movie and in the middle the movie 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 I think how much time is going to how long 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.250
 lack is something that for me is not 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.459
 running the tape and that was what I 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.660
 happened after the end it seemed very 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.150
 good or 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.310
 they cut the story at the right moment 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.350
 has an interesting ending more for the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.500
 who do not know anything about the story now 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.630
 that is good the performances that I can 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.620
 tell the truth that they are very good 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.120
 surprised Peter lanzani expected more than 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.600
 guillermo franchella who is like the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.770
 actor maybe more stronger than the tape 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.580
 but I have to say that the performance of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.550
 fran chela is like what 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.500
 It's not bad, obviously, it's good 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.720
 but not listening because because 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.360
 really the personality of his 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.610
 character makes it no more than what 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.260
 did not or is it very good acting 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.150
 what happens with the character that is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 leave a little that said instead the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.560
 education of this boy or peter lanzani 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.210
 surprised a little more the constantly 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.850
 is with this internal struggle this 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.520
 dichotomy and one appeared good is a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.330
 little bit premiered and for now so 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.630
 which is existing here and three days 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.100
 they saw more decrease in people here 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.340
 so good surely goes for good 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.060
 way but but personally I just 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.560
 see and my qualification for the clan is a 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.540
 7 because if it's a good movie it's not and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.150
 until there we arrived 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.670
 could have done something better yes I think 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.759
 I do believe that it could have been done 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.430
 something much better and very upset 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.910
 see something very much better mainly 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.120
 for the content of the tapes but to the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.560
 story I mean and by the actors 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.690
 but good the vision of the director was 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.669
 That's what our show wanted to show 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.009
 effort and good and that's what we saw 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.419
 so if you want to see it, it 's good 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.180
 that are fanatical about these things 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.979
 real rights of real life that what 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.130
 what they are seeing on the screen is what 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.050
 I really recommend it, see it and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.470
 after watching the movie if they want your 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.729
 fifth month wikipedia and they report a 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.110
 little bit more than what happened 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.849
 then before because if you are going to 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.470
 ruin the movie actually from 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.419
 Indeed most Argentines 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.000
 they will see but it is a very famous case in 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:08.160
 argentina and 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.660
 it's like when he works when they arrive 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.390
 to that situation if you liked the video 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.090
 give to like is subscribe share it 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.960
 comment it and we are seeing 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.280
 very very very soon there is very little missing 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.919
 only day for the premiere of the walking 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.080
 dead so good we're anxious 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.030
 I am needy as well as as a 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.680
 series and good as now I'm starting 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.479
 to do in the videos I'm going to 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.340
 recommend a movie to see more 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.740
 beyond which I recommend them 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.940
 can see and how we come with the criticism 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.530
 of an Argentine movie I'm going to 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.380
 remember another feature film for 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.970
 me a movie one of the best 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.590
 Argentine movies that I saw I liked 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.160
 much 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.250
 and they have made an adaptation 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.030
 in the USA of this movie if I do not remember 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.010
 evil calls the times not the impostors 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
 do not put them plus four as they are but the 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.150
 only that I am going to recommend is new 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.910
 Queens with my Ricardo Darín and Gastón 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.800
 pool a very interesting movie 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.570
 basically tells us the story of a 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 group of scammers who are dedicated to 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.080
 these people bars there is no more 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.060
 no less than that but the movie is very 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.670
 interesting the plot very interesting in 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.820
 these things are good and in the end it's very 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.560
 very good I recommend them the truth 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.930
 for the weekend so good that 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.530
 it was all for today we'll see 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.530
 the next
