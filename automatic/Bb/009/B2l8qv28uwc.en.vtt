00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
some some footage of the circuit that I

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.000 
some some footage of the circuit that I
usually<00:01:23.240> take<00:01:23.360> what<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.600> plumbing<00:01:23.870> troops<00:01:24.080> this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
usually take what I plumbing troops this

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.990 
usually take what I plumbing troops this
is<00:01:25.159> one<00:01:25.550> of<00:01:25.580> two<00:01:25.730> areas<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.510> farm<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.820> my

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
is one of two areas to farm this is my

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060 
is one of two areas to farm this is my
preference<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.860> place<00:01:31.040> that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
preference and it's the place that

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.460 
preference and it's the place that
everyone<00:01:31.580> can<00:01:31.940> can<00:01:32.390> go<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.690> fine<00:01:32.900> clothes<00:01:33.140> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
everyone can can go in fine clothes the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.260 
everyone can can go in fine clothes the
other<00:01:33.620> place<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.610> little<00:01:34.940> bit<00:01:35.120> more

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
other place is a little bit more

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.140 
other place is a little bit more
difficult<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.600> solo<00:01:35.870> you<00:01:36.050> kind<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.560> have<00:01:36.740> to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
difficult to solo you kind of have to

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.280 
difficult to solo you kind of have to
yeah<00:01:38.150> really<00:01:38.479> be<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.840> ball<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.170> your

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
yeah really be on the ball with your

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.750 
yeah really be on the ball with your
self<00:01:39.500> healing<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.220> bit<00:01:40.340> more<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.640> it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
self healing and it's a bit more of it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.690 
self healing and it's a bit more of it
in<00:01:40.940> say<00:01:41.540> map<00:01:41.780> while<00:01:42.710> everyone<00:01:42.979> can<00:01:43.340> do<00:01:43.520> this

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
in say map while everyone can do this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.520 
in say map while everyone can do this
there<00:01:44.210> are<00:01:44.390> some<00:01:44.540> classes<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.140> works<00:01:45.350> better

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
there are some classes this works better

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.039 
there are some classes this works better
for<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.010> see<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.490> my<00:01:46.640> death<00:01:46.909> knight

for you see I'm on my death knight

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.090 
for you see I'm on my death knight
essentially<00:01:48.049> all<00:01:48.200> I'm<00:01:48.290> doing<00:01:48.560> as<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:48.950> see

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the first day we lifted decays of course

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.510 
the first day we lifted decays of course
of<00:02:00.650> cali<00:02:00.830> blast<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:02.330> Warriors<00:02:03.250> hunters<00:02:04.250> are

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
of cali blast the Warriors hunters are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.250 
of cali blast the Warriors hunters are
you<00:02:05.210> know<00:02:05.299> maybe<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.659> best<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.080> range

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
you know maybe the best the range

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.999 
you know maybe the best the range
classes<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.010> honestly<00:02:08.229> yeah<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:09.409> range

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
classes and honestly yeah I think range

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.449 
classes and honestly yeah I think range
classes<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.519> general<00:02:11.290> maybe<00:02:12.290> aren't<00:02:12.650> quite<00:02:13.189> so

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
classes in general maybe aren't quite so

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.260 
classes in general maybe aren't quite so
good

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
good

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.710 
good
for<00:02:14.390> doing<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.660> for<00:02:14.980> example<00:02:15.980> i<00:02:16.010> play<00:02:16.220> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
for doing this for example i play a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.030 
for doing this for example i play a
druid<00:02:17.720> mates<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.380> because<00:02:18.680> they<00:02:18.890> can

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
druid mates back in my because they can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.480 
druid mates back in my because they can
function<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:20.470> yeah<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> much<00:02:21.770> prefer<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.160> DK

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
function and yeah I much prefer my DK

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.770 
function and yeah I much prefer my DK
even<00:02:22.760> though<00:02:22.820> my<00:02:22.970> thinking<00:02:23.330> as<00:02:23.420> much<00:02:23.570> more

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
even though my thinking as much more

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.200 
even though my thinking as much more
geared<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.850> doesn't<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
geared it's just doesn't have the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.510 
geared it's just doesn't have the
instant<00:02:26.720> burst<00:02:26.960> dps<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.920> involves<00:02:28.370> me

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
instant burst dps it involves me

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.640 
instant burst dps it involves me
dropping<00:02:29.210> mushrooms<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.080> those<00:02:30.200> were<00:02:30.380> doing

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
dropping mushrooms and those were doing

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890 
dropping mushrooms and those were doing
hurricanes<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.460> in<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.390> end<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:32.720> can't

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
hurricanes and in the end I just can't

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.420 
hurricanes and in the end I just can't
quite<00:02:33.080> move<00:02:33.290> as<00:02:33.410> quickly<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:33.890> can<00:02:34.070> while<00:02:34.280> I'm

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
quite move as quickly as I can while I'm

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.140 
quite move as quickly as I can while I'm
in<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> BK<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> idea<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.610> I'll<00:02:37.970> actually

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
in the BK so the idea is I'll actually

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.130 
in the BK so the idea is I'll actually
fly<00:02:38.480> around<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:39.550> i'll<00:02:40.550> pick<00:02:40.820> out<00:02:40.970> any<00:02:41.240> packs

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
fly around and i'll pick out any packs

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.530 
fly around and i'll pick out any packs
of<00:02:42.290> mobs<00:02:42.500> with<00:02:42.800> i<00:02:43.070> try<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> get<00:02:43.850> more<00:02:44.090> than<00:02:44.300> five

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
of mobs with i try to get more than five

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.330 
of mobs with i try to get more than five
tribes<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.320> 6<00:02:45.590> plus<00:02:45.820> I'll<00:02:47.230> stop<00:02:48.230> off<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.590> packs

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
tribes so 6 plus I'll stop off it packs

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.780 
tribes so 6 plus I'll stop off it packs
of<00:02:49.550> 5<00:02:49.790> occasionally<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.350> it's<00:02:51.530> convenient<00:02:51.830> but

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
of 5 occasionally if it's convenient but

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.340 
of 5 occasionally if it's convenient but
generally<00:02:53.210> yeah<00:02:53.810> I'll<00:02:53.960> just<00:02:53.990> fly<00:02:54.320> straight

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
generally yeah I'll just fly straight

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620 
generally yeah I'll just fly straight
past<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.430> smaller<00:02:55.670> packs<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.390> because

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
past the the smaller packs just because

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.180 
past the the smaller packs just because
it's<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:56.840> really<00:02:57.020> worth<00:02:57.200> stopping<00:02:57.500> at<00:02:57.890> that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's not really worth stopping at that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.000 
it's not really worth stopping at that
one<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.520> them<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.750> advantage<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.380> farming

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
one of them the advantage of farming

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.660 
one of them the advantage of farming
this<00:03:01.130> way<00:03:01.250> obviously<00:03:02.470> farming<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.770> grinding

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
this way obviously farming and grinding

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.150 
this way obviously farming and grinding
like<00:03:04.760> this<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.380> not<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.530> most<00:03:06.710> fun<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.130> to

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
like this is not the most fun way to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.990 
like this is not the most fun way to
played<00:03:07.430> again<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:09.100> actually<00:03:10.100> pretty<00:03:10.880> boring

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
played again it's actually pretty boring

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.380 
played again it's actually pretty boring
and<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.600> understand<00:03:12.410> life<00:03:13.010> I'm<00:03:13.310> not<00:03:13.880> input<00:03:14.210> so

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and I understand life I'm not input so

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.860 
and I understand life I'm not input so
much<00:03:14.570> but<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:16.070> know<00:03:16.300> with<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.330> pushin<00:03:17.780> at

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
much but you know with the pushin at

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.570 
much but you know with the pushin at
redefining<00:03:18.350> you've<00:03:18.740> got<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.070> running<00:03:19.400> our

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
redefining you've got that running our

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.820 
redefining you've got that running our
climber<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.050> do<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.260> amused<00:03:21.530> by<00:03:21.770> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
climber so we can do it amused by the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.000 
climber so we can do it amused by the
time<00:03:22.070> when<00:03:22.220> you<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.550> have<00:03:23.270> nothing<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:23.720> do

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
time when you just have nothing to do

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.230 
time when you just have nothing to do
have<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.130> admit<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.459> being<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.820> lot<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.150> me

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
have to admit this being a lot to me

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.070 
have to admit this being a lot to me
lately<00:03:26.450> as<00:03:27.790> cattle<00:03:28.790> winds<00:03:28.970> down<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.570> mop<00:03:29.930> is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
lately as cattle winds down and mop is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.020 
lately as cattle winds down and mop is
around<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.410> corner<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:31.730> don't<00:03:31.910> have<00:03:32.000> a

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
around the corner we don't have a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.180 
around the corner we don't have a
scenario<00:03:32.390> yet<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.560> there's<00:03:33.920> not<00:03:34.010> really

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
scenario yet so there's not really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.940 
scenario yet so there's not really
anything<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.610> do<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:35.690> puts<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.230> timer<00:03:36.500> upper<00:03:36.770> so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
anything to do it puts a timer upper so

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.470 
anything to do it puts a timer upper so
it's<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.160> goal<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.550> appeals<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.120> that's<00:03:38.360> a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
it's a goal for appeals and that's a

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.710 
it's a goal for appeals and that's a
huge<00:03:38.840> hope<00:03:39.310> I've<00:03:40.310> never<00:03:40.580> find<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.000> motivation

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
huge hope I've never find the motivation

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.449 
huge hope I've never find the motivation
to<00:03:41.900> grind<00:03:42.230> without<00:03:42.500> potion<00:03:42.920> treasure<00:03:43.130> plenty

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
to grind without potion treasure plenty

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.960 
to grind without potion treasure plenty
this<00:03:44.120> gives<00:03:45.020> me<00:03:45.110> an<00:03:45.200> NP<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.950> after<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.790> hours

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
this gives me an NP and after that hours

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.590 
this gives me an NP and after that hours
up<00:03:47.209> I'm<00:03:47.360> going<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.570> go<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.720> do<00:03:47.840> something<00:03:47.900> else

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
up I'm going to go and do something else

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.340 
up I'm going to go and do something else
so<00:03:50.600> I'm<00:03:51.490> kind<00:03:52.490> of<00:03:52.580> equipping<00:03:52.820> all<00:03:53.450> 22<00:03:54.110> slot

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
so I'm kind of equipping all 22 slot

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.780 
so I'm kind of equipping all 22 slot

bags and one death knight of the mode
and<00:03:56.200> i<00:03:57.200> found<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.010> they<00:03:58.190> better<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.880> all
