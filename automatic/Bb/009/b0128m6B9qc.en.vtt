00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.919
 hello everyone as we are and I bring you 

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.500
 a review that I have been asked 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.549
 much that is from the mascara 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.929
 de maybelline la de sparks is big eyes 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.219
 it stands out that it has shown in several 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.740
 videos and they all say do not want to stay 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.440
 and after tabs and I do not have that 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.420
 it does not work for me how you use it 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.660
 you make for you to love yourself and so I 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.520
 I 'm going to show you how he applied it and 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.900
 What do you think about me in general? 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.760
 I have enough answers but 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.380
 remember that not all products 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.540
 work the same for all, not all 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.430
 we have the same eyelashes the same 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.450
 form at the same length the same thickness per 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.340
 so the products are going to 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.500
 work different if on the tabs 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.380
 it seemed to me maybe it will work for you if it is not 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.079
 You can try to try applying it 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.360
 as I applied it so I leave you with the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.210
 video of me applying that mask of 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.880
 tabs now here then this is the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 Mascara comes with a part 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.390
 the area that for the upper lashes 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.969
 and a black part for the eyelashes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.300
 Bottom of the brush for the eyelashes 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.519
 higher this is so in spiral form 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.230
 Here is the trick where I use it as 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.240
 you can see it is flatter 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.380
 and with more perky little hairs I 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.030
 I put that part in my eyelashes 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.190
 flat to give more volume and to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 give me more product because if the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.670
 I put here the experts 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 it leaves me very long, not with so much 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.659
 volume so that's how I applied it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.759
 since the lower lashes does not have 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.110
 thank you very much it's a very long little one 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.320
 then let's start with the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.090
 upper lashes as I told them 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 I put the flattest part against my eye 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 also the brush every time 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.470
 want until I like the way 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.470
 the one that remained 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.380
 this party and once it is dry is 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.640
 so if you want to apply layers have 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.770
 to apply it before the party in 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.320
 that follow and as I have the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.870
 tab with masks I do not know if I want to go 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.790
 to interspersed to the flattest part with 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.560
 the brushes but I like more 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.000
 apply it flat and now I'm going to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.370
 show the one with the lower lashes 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.070
 that really does not have a grace and I 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.860
 like it because it 's long then it covers you 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 all tabs at one time 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.800
 and here are the posts three sizes 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.110
 upper bottoms with mask 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.400
 eyelashes and here you can not see me leaves you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.650
 very long thick 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.810
 in fact the root and a peak very well in 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 the root and then there were so that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.380
 there is the greatest amount of product there 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 and you see more volume obviously not all 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.240
 we have the same eyelashes maybe you 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.850
 you have the shortest lashes 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.850
 Thick more pieces I do not know everything depends on 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.980
 my soles in particular are such a 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.770
 normal length are not very long but not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.600
 they are short grenades are not very thick and 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.130
 they are not pieces at all in fact neither 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.370
 I even curled up on my eyelashes 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.860
 before because it is not necessary it is maintained 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.959
 the same curve with the mascara itself and I 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.880
 he does the curve so he did not apply mascara 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.530
 before it works for me I do not know if you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.930
 it will work depends on how your 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.100
 eyelashes another thing is that it does not run 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.410
 all day I do not appear here as 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 black what yes you run with water and you 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.970
 Can be removed with make-up remover or with 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.620
 down with soap as it says on the page 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.500
 for but I occupied it with the makeup 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.470
 it made super easy I hope it has served 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.220
 that you liked it and tell me how you 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.710
 works more 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.280
 eyelashes and that we're not seeing in a 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.280
 proximity
