classic<00:00:56.180> at<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.480> end<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.720> day<00:00:56.899> but<00:00:56.960> people

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
classic at the end of the day but people

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.229 
classic at the end of the day but people
think<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.430> little<00:00:58.550> bit<00:00:58.700> outrageous

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
think that it's a little bit outrageous

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.670 
think that it's a little bit outrageous
and<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.450> guess<00:00:59.630> that's<00:00:59.809> mostly<00:01:00.140> because<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.500> the

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
and I guess that's mostly because of the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.100 
and I guess that's mostly because of the
Fed<00:01:00.980> or<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.579> like<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> funny<00:01:02.270> shoe<00:01:02.630> there's

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
Fed or I like a funny shoe there's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.840 
Fed or I like a funny shoe there's
always<00:01:03.290> one<00:01:03.590> thing<00:01:03.920> that's<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.309> little<00:01:04.339> bit<00:01:04.670> off

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
always one thing that's a little bit off

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.940 
always one thing that's a little bit off
and<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.210> think<00:01:05.420> that's<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.200> most<00:01:06.380> important

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
and I think that's the most important

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.499 
and I think that's the most important
ingredient<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.969> dressing<00:01:08.450> well<00:01:08.659> for<00:01:09.200> me<00:01:10.509> my
