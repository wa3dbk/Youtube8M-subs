00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello my name is william sanchez 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.710
 team lose belly 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.790
 puntocom in this video I want to share 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 with you who are the fat cells 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.540
 all cells are units 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 morphologically and functionally 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 independent for you to understand 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 well a cell is like it's a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.279
 soldier of a regiment has a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 individual function within each 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.720
 battalion in the case of cells 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 fats are soldiers of the regiment 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.450
 Adipose tissue is why they are called 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
 adipocytes the adipose tissue that is the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.160
 fat does not have only fat cells are 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.840
 the great majority but also coexist with 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.879
 other cells that form others 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 regiments like support cells 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.110
 of the vessels that carry blood and so on 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 etc. what is the function of the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.270
 fat cells the main function of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.489
 Fat cells is storage 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.469
 of energy when you eat any 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 food and you do not spend it your body 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 responsible for transforming it into fat and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.890
 save it in fat cells to be 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.559
 used at some point are the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 reserve the body's energy if it does 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.479
 lack is used and if it is not within 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 the fats your body keeps the energy 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.170
 what's left over because he does not know when you're going to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 re-ingest energy by means of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 food the fat is a very 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.759
 effective to save energy since it occupies 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.520
 relatively little place of course 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.500
 fat cells grow fat 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.170
 increase in size as they go 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
 accumulating energy this energy is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.820
 keeps inside the adipocytes in shape 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 of triglycerides when needed 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.290
 energy performs the reverse process the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.179
 fat cells are released from the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 triglycerides transforming them into 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.610
 energy and reduce their size 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.250
 adipocytes can grow a lot can 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 increase eight times its normal size and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.649
 that growth translates into an increase 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.570
 of weight logically however we want 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.640
 differentiate next when a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.399
 adult fat and fat as a child 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.190
 the mechanisms are different as 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.320
 fatten fat cells in the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.759
 adults the process is called hypertrophy 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.160
 and what happens is that the cells 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.009
 they increase in size therefore of that 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.019
 way we gain weight in children 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.440
 the increase in fat cells is 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.740
 produces 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.930
 number phenomenon called hyperplasia 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.350
 the cells multiply unlike 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.210
 of adults who increase their size 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.400
 repeating then if we get fat of 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.260
 child gain weight by increasing amount 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.440
 of cells and in adult by increase of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.890
 size of the cells is important this 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.870
 clear difference that it is if we increase 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.850
 of weight when we children increase the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.130
 number of fat cells hyperplasia and 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 as adults we have many more cells 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.630
 willing to increase in size 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.340
 hypertrophy therefore a child with 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.400
 Obesity has a lot of odds 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.680
 of being obese as an adult that's why 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.690
 important that as children we do not increase 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.810
 weight to prevent them from increasing in number 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.330
 our fat cells other functions 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.790
 of fat cells fat cells 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.250
 not only do they keep energy they also release 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 substances or hormones behaving like 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.770
 if they were a gland releases around 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.410
 of 120 substances some known and 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.210
 others not so much these substances are the 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.150
 responsible for producing syndrome 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.650
 metabolic hypertension 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.819
 Insulin resistance disorders 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.099
 menstrual 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.290
 fatty predisposition to certain type of 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.319
 infarcts tumors and other problems 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.749
 cardiovascular if the information that 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.310
 I just shared with you you liked and 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.769
 you think it helps you in the process 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.109
 to lose weight I'll ask you three 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.019

 youtube channel so that every time 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.799
 post a new video can alert you 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.659
 to study it if you apply it 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.389
 third below this video click on 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.919
 I like it and then place a comment 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.049
 about the information that I just 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.419
 reveal yourself even if you have any doubt 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.939
 or question put it there and I assure you 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.250
 that I will answer it as soon as possible 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.260
 your success to lose weight says goodbye 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.109
 Your friend William Sanchez Team 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.519
 work lose the dotcom belly 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.519
 have a wonderful day
