00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.790
 to get through round 1 without dying but 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 we can recover lives the only part 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.390
 positive in a very platform game 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.040
 difficult to start bad and what is wrong 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040

 they know me touch a little easier this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.140
 game they did love the weeds because 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 it is very difficult to pull here in your voice 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.090
 until at least recover life by 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.550

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.720
 from all the enemies these 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.180
 disgusting you see 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.580
 I am very nervous but quite 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 nervous to try it there is dale 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.900
 dale dale dale dale dale perfect 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 only being pussy has not given me 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.310
 has given me reminds certain enemy in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.760
 sonic knuckles I was going and pretty much 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.980
 same or very similar does not say anything else 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.960
 well, let's go to the challenge like 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.600
 you are watching a game that is going to be 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.060
 16 bit super curred with graphics 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.920
 incredible the control answers very very 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.560
 very perfectly the thing is that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 tell leaves nothing to be desired is 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 pretty well assembled the control was the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 by directly relative to the control the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.130
 game the truth the game diminish a 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 little graphic quality but it does not show 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.440
 as much as unlike other games 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.430
 arcade how can the game be 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.950
 will leave a half that I always call 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.600
 that were to be raid is for example well 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.220
 we are already in the first one is the first 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.530
 part is good the city apart from being 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.470
 a part of the level that the dungeon 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.080
 I burn, do not burn, mate, I go to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.569
 He beat the man beard is here wants 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 make visits to me I do not know why always 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.870
 always as naming the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.090
 enemies is super stupid and super 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.470
 simple 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.480
 let's go and there are the spikes 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.879
 do not kill me please for what I want 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.510
 see how many of these there are not 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.030
 they tire of appearing me beard mantle there 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
 is ready ready beard man care 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.030
 because barman tends to appear where 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.780
 least you expect 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.720
 It is very very difficult many years ago 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.040
 I did not play it and for a challenge I do not know 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.440
 if he had managed to overcome that now 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.300
 the boss comes and the boss is pretty 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.270
 difficult here we have the boss 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.330
 the boss must be removed from here the boss 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.590
 We are sticking with your fists the cardboard 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.230
 ct you have to dodge it a little bit 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.180
 the partner is hitting us 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.890
 thank us in turn 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.900
 you have to go around dodging that we have 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.709
 a lot of skill for this game what 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 I say from now I'm going to dodge 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.129
 ay has given me a good blow we are going to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.060
 hit him a couple of strokes of 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.060
 counterpart then 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.379
 I call myself Basque there is an arm 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.959
 less than 'chief of bosses' is done 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.340
 It's much easier for the good thing to be 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.300
 when it comes to attack, it stays pretty 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.100
 quiet time 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.630
 you have to go jumping them, we can not 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.500
 to stay still is a fight where no 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.500
 we can stay still 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.970
 the stress stress the arms friends and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.470
 friends now the boss leaves totally 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.390
 helpless but of course you have to have 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.220
 careful because the boss who says no 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.540
 is going to stop moving u and well that's 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.990
 defenseless everyone we know that always 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.340
 it is quite relative to always understand 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.240
 that one is channel that they scream to life 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.980
 and it's over dead boss and the challenge 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.510
 it would be this friends and a half of youtube that 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.769
