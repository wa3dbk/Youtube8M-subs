00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.950
 then he held me 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.230
 and then 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.230
 more modest 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.380
 I chose only gaming from the guys 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.080
 as you can see lately I'm dedicating myself 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.070
 much more and commented than at 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 gameplay 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.869
 this is because I like it much more 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.270
 make commentaries that the gameplay also 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.520
 because I started looking at the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.880
 best from goal to step and I always am 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.770
 liked them so let's say I'll give myself 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.650
 much more is commented on than on 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.710
 gameplay but I'm not saying I won't 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.809
 more gameplay will be there but in quantity 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.270
 minors and there will be many more comments 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.600
 also because I like it much more 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.690
 do comment shyly much better 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.589
 let's just start with today's topic 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.670
 or with assemble assemble or 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:10.049
 how to assemble a gaming pc for 800 euros 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.049
 with eight hundred euros we say let's face it 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.850
 then he started to say that a user did 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.210
 asked to make a configuration from 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.039
 800 euros including the monitor 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.320
 unfortunately I did not succeed where i 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.119
 monitor but I will still give you the same 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.580
 advice on a low-price monitor 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.310
 that of good quality at the end of the video 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.560
 at the end of the configuration 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.659
 let's start immediately before leaving though 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.780
 I wanted to make you a premise or that i 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.509
 pieces I chose were from me and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.159
 so reasons i want to say is gorgeous of 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.869
 that other spend less was more 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.259
 powerful I don't give a fuck 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.149
 because these are the pieces that I 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.280
 I would buy if I had 800 euros 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.740
 now we can start we leave immediately 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.110
 with the mob or the fashion board ie 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.970
 the motherboard or the piece where 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.640
 all will be assembled 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.390
 other verses as mother bait I chose 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.140
 an asus rock does not know soon as soon as rock 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.470
 of 75 pro 3m is a very motherboard 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.920
 good run at 62 euros on amazon indeed 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 liquid see then inscription is a 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.200
 motherboard with 1155 socket with chipset 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.570
 of 75 to exit 3.0 2.0 the card 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.060
 so integrated graphics is a nice one 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.320
 Four-slot motherboard ram those 2 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.760
 video card slot and nothing like this 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.350
 it's a good motherboard where we're going 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.989
 then to assemble our processor 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.820
 that we see immediately as we chose more 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.590
 an i5 3570 k the best processor for 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.700
 gaming at least in my opinion because it is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.940
 used by many gamers is suitable that is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.440
 no adaptable is 7155 so it is too 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.510
 one hundred percent compatible with the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.209
 motherboard having a hundred make-up 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.739
 in fact the name letter k is one hundred 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.200
 alongside the name means that it has the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.450
 then multiplier unlocked 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.930
 we can to play maximum without 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.420
 that explodes everything I give you 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.010
 It is that you no longer care always 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.440
 original heat sink because that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.330
 of the original intel really makes shit 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.459
 then especially on these processors that 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.610
 warm a bang overclock with the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.560
 main second is a crazy thing 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.560
 then we go straight to the ram I decided 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.380
 to take 2 gb of ram and 2 bhatti's 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.950
 4 GB RAM for a total of 8 GB of RAM 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.959
 of the corsair ben ganz work on one 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.000
 frequency of 1600 makers on the frequency 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.390
 really very high and let's say this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.209
 76 euros a good price there are in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.299
 different colors or black red 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.400
 blue and maybe golden 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.950
 I don't remember what to do system but 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.930
 however I chose the color does not have to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.599
 fuck but the demonstrations is only one 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.430
 aesthetic thing with that motherboard 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.250
 he had taken the black one that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.140
 see the liquor here in the images 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.160
 always in description and nothing we pass 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.989
 to other 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.329
 let's talk about video card which is one thing 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.510
 essential and two in the gaming pool like 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.250
 video card I chose a gtx 770 like 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.479
 mine but not quite like my facts 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.070
 the manufacturer lms ai the video card 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.930
 really nice and nice guys 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.760
 especially powerful because in a pc 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.070
 gaming as said earlier also 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.700
 video card is the essential thing and 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.410
 costs 299 euros or 300 euros almost yes 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.090
 gives is presented because it costs 299 and 96 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.100
 because even the six cents want 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.410
 hyatt boys of the scandals that is not there 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.940
 nothing to say to the most powerful will bring us 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.010
 for about 45 years at maximum detail 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.560
 maybe giving up some filter in 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.020
 future and no numbers on this card 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.729
 revenge video I can say that to 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.720
 power to sell is very much 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.240
 very prudent fool and nothing these 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 are the essential things for a gaming PC 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.520
 then what's not was not like that 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.870
 essential because the essential thing is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.700
 the power supply because without it not 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.340
 we can turn on our pc because it is 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.400
 what gives power to everything 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.000
 a power supply I chose a cz or 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.430
 assisi from 600 watts loach itself from 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.250
 Italians and Italians we are the name is 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.600
 very very good as a brand are 600 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.850
 watt curves costs 70 euros which is a price 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.770
 quite content with 600 watts but 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.240
 however it is very very reliable it is 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.520
 certainly between our turn 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.070
 configuration in an exceptional way 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.320
 we can also change a processor to 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.690
 future because still power to sell 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.620
 the configuration I did where 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.300
 consume on the 450 500 watts then 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.800
 we still have 108 available that 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.370
 they serve to breathe a little more 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.090
 the power supply and then nothing then the 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.130
 keys 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.930
 let's talk about that they always on one 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.000
 essential thing also because otherwise 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.960
 we put pieces on the floor then 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.710
 Someone passes by and France with their feet 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.870
 like keys 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.949
 I chose a very very beautiful cast 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.470
 even if expensive that among other things 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:16.560
 the voice of this 81 was 76 years old 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:21.330
 very well then already my budget maybe 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.750
 however it will be exceeded 101 zambon z11 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.820
 which I think is the best casey in 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.740
 circulation in value for money 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.599
 best 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.210
 aesthetically it is a monster a monster in 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:35.760
 all the senses looks like a transformers but 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.419
 ie too guys I think this 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.130
 keys if you didn't have the computer 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.110
 actions I would have this country because 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.510
 really spectacular 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.780
 nothing to say on that is very 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:51.240
 good and fuck you 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.479
 then we talk about less essential things 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.940
 or the CD player that costs 15 euros 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:59.280
 but let's say they throw them in the face up 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.830
 amazon su e bay 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.310
 the vendola shops however I chose 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.050
 this costs 15 euros and among other things 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.800
 now it's not even available in the 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.330
 ass that guys ass is nothing a 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.190
 advice that I give you because if not 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.210
 we are already wrong with these pieces 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.400
 arrived at 200 euros 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.620
 a piece of advice I give you and cooling 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.780
 for the more I advise you to take 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.050
 a liquid cooling of the stroke 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:29.550
 and lacquer or 61 if I'm not mistaken he 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.100
 immediately immediately or varnish 60 of the 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.750
 run this plane about 60 euros and it is 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.390
 very very good especially because 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.640
 maybe I had it and it is very very efficient 

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.290
 and lastly as a monitor for the 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.419
 wrote that you asked me 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.760
 I chose a fairly good monitor 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.320
 which also costs very little however lg 22 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.810
 inch I don't know the exact model 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.790
 say why they are all letters and numbers 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.830
 it costs a lot to the demon on the 95 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.050
 good and I really recommend it to everyone 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.370
 how many and no boys can be everything 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.510
 from this video I hope there has been 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.000
 help I observe I leave a nice a 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:02.760
 commit sign up for all the pieces 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.710
 I leave you in description in the case of 

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.390
 doubts write me a commentary here and there 

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:09.630
 I will always answer because I am always 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:13.430
 available for you go boyfriend 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.430
 by I greet you and hello
