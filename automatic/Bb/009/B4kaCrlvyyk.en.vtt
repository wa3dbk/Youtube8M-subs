00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 or the people in focus is because they 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.670
 find this opportunity very well 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.529
 let's see a very interesting movie 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.529
 it's about chapÃ­n 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.840
 is to open it is directed by tim duncan 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.119
 who directed films in sector 9 and 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.310
 the language personally liked the 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.650
 movie sector 9 I made a not so much 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.869
 is starring dep h 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.970
 hugh jackman and what is this 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.160
 good movie only know what it's about 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.019
 of txanpi's robot but behind it 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.839
 there is a company that is dedicated to creating 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.820
 robots that work like policemen is 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.070
 say that instead of having beings 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 humans fighting crime too 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.250
 they have many many robots why 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.109
 because the robots are bulletproof and good 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.059
 if they kill one of them really not 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.949
 nothing happens if they kill a policeman which 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.109
 well it's fine and one of the scientists 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.780
 who are dedicated to creating this technology 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.640
 apparently he has a lot of free time 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.859
 because he is dedicated to developing a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.009
 system that allows you to have one of 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.009
 those robots a reasoning of their own and 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.869
 human feelings what's interesting is 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.910
 that those feelings is not that it's a 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.790
 robot that tries to emulate like laughs 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.700
 how we cry as we feel but what 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.370
 is the same robot will feel going to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.860
 suffer and you will perceive things as if 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.060
 outside such as a human the truth is 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.980
 that in the beginning this movie has 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.340
 theological questions 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.410
 moral and social technologies 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.720
 extremely interesting unfortunately 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.030
 they are quite overshadowed by decisions 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.800
 strange of the director and one of those 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.860
 decisions is that the movie becomes 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.320
 very caricatured very very caricatured 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.880
 mainly because of their characters since 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.400
 the director made the decision to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.310
 incorporate as actors to a group 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.710
 musical die and wood but I miss it 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.840
 who is not that two singers act 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 as he has done timberlake presidia what 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 yes, that fact makes the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 characters are very caricatured but 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.820
 not only them but also the rest of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.560
 the characters are very one-dimensional 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.720
 it's chocolate chocolate cake 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
 chocolate strawberry or chocolate very 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.860
 strangely the character has more 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.410
 layers many more dimensions and much 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 depth from the robot the chapi 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 chapi really turns out to be a character 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 very charismatic with which we connect 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.099
 quickly and it becomes very 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.480
 endearing so I clacked what good 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.400
 that the movie is more chapino than 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.950
 tacoma because if it really is who else 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.860
 stands out and the only character whose 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.879
 occupation does not turn out to be so 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.560
 caricatured on the other hand also the 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.629
 director followed some of his rules 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.459
 previous feels that repeats a lot 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.280
 again the formula documentary style 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.010
 dare where all like half dirty 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.660
 half destroyed and again it returns to 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.090
 do here using almost the same 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.530
 locations which is not bad there is not a 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.030
 problem with a director following 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.310
 always the same style but sometimes 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.690
 it seems that I take scenes that we already saw in 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.069
 other movies and vulgarly nor 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.750
 Chapi is what gives a little this 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.310
 feeling something that we can mention 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.739
 that is very good are the scenes of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.930
 Actually they are very entertaining 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.489
 they are very frustrating and not just the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 action scenes but is that once 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.379
 that you take the movie more lightly 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.530
 she is very funny she has very 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.329
 Funny very funny moments that the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.239
 they really make us laugh a lot though 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.430
 soon they are very awkward very logical but 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.160
 they are fun and talking a little 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.200
 of the logical also that is one of the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.750
 stumbling blocks of the movie that pose 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.120
 things in a certain way in a universe and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.239
 then later within that universe that 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.980
 they already created does not meet their same rules 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.109
 but as they do what they are given in 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.269
 wins and everything is possible and nothing matters 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.340
 really which goes back to the movie 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.959
 very incoherent and the fact that 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.489
 there is a robot or human feelings there 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.680
 it has to be incoherent everything can 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.239
 function as an avatar to say is 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.819
 inconsistent the avatar world but 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
 inside avatar everything works fine I think 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.730
 which is a movie that has a 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.769
 really very interesting proposal 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.819
 that has several hits on everything 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.709
 visual and in aesthetics but it is lost in 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.919
 his same story I am the spirit the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.750
 I give you where stars of 5 you 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.849
 you will see tell me what you think about this 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.799
 tape and what is your robot movie 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.370
 favorite leave here down at the 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.169
