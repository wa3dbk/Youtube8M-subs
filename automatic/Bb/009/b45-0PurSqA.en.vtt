going<00:02:37.829> around<00:02:38.010> no<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.390> reason<00:02:39.599> I<00:02:39.840> say<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
going around no the reason I say that it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.339 
going around no the reason I say that it
potentially<00:02:41.120> would<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.510> fake<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.989> because

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
potentially would not be fake is because

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.199 
potentially would not be fake is because
of<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> environment<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.489> surroundings<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
of the environment the surroundings I

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.330 
of the environment the surroundings I
know<00:02:45.269> people<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.900> pull<00:02:46.110> off<00:02:46.319> extremely<00:02:46.829> fake

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.729 
know people can pull off extremely fake
things<00:02:47.610> very<00:02:47.940> well<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.170> does<00:02:49.349> sound<00:02:49.620> like

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
things very well but it does sound like

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.640 
things very well but it does sound like

least being recorded on a cell phone so

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.220 
least being recorded on a cell phone so
I<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:56.879> how<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> would<00:02:57.420> fake<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
I don't know how you would fake that to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.890 
I don't know how you would fake that to
easily<00:02:59.099> with<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> echo<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.180> giant<00:03:00.569> room

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
easily with the echo and a giant room

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
easily with the echo and a giant room
and<00:03:01.200> things<00:03:01.379> like<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:02.010> shown<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and things like that it's shown on a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.360 
and things like that it's shown on a
very<00:03:02.730> large<00:03:03.030> screen<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> cell<00:03:04.049> phone

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
very large screen with the cell phone

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.309 
very large screen with the cell phone
things<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.579> nature<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.090> if<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> pig

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
things of that nature so if it is a pig

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.500 
things of that nature so if it is a pig
it's<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.680> damn<00:03:07.889> good<00:03:07.920> fake<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.730> that's<00:03:09.120> all<00:03:09.329> I'm

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it's a damn good fake and that's all I'm

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.240 
it's a damn good fake and that's all I'm
going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.780> say<00:03:09.989> about<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.230> if<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:10.920> fig

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
going to say about it if it's not a fig

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
going to say about it if it's not a fig
then<00:03:11.609> that's<00:03:12.209> exactly<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.989> direction

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
then that's exactly the direction

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680 
then that's exactly the direction
Nintendo<00:03:13.859> should<00:03:14.099> be<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:14.790> if<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.660> a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
Nintendo should be going and if it is a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.210 
Nintendo should be going and if it is a
fake<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.230> Nintendo<00:03:16.680> should<00:03:16.829> look<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.130> this

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
fake the Nintendo should look at this

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.220 
fake the Nintendo should look at this
video<00:03:17.549> see<00:03:18.090> how<00:03:18.359> many<00:03:18.540> people<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:19.019> like

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
video see how many people would like

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.800 
video see how many people would like
this<00:03:19.440> thing<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.889> be<00:03:20.010> true<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.450> use

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
this thing to be true and actually use

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.970 
this thing to be true and actually use
it<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.200> go<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:22.769> it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
it and go with it

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
it and go with it
now<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.340> Nintendo<00:03:23.549> presented<00:03:24.329> something<00:03:24.780> like

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
now if Nintendo presented something like

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.339 
now if Nintendo presented something like
this<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.769> e3<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:27.030> everyone<00:03:27.720> would<00:03:28.109> have

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.860 
this at e3 I think everyone would have
clapped<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.250> loved<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.819> being<00:03:30.180> able<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.540> take

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
clapped and loved it being able to take

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.479 
clapped and loved it being able to take

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.550 
it anywhere you want would have been
perfect<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.630> think<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.230> would<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.470> been

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
perfect I think that would have been

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.140 
perfect I think that would have been
excellent<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> that's<00:03:44.519> kind<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:44.940> what<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
excellent and that's kind of what I

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.030 
excellent and that's kind of what I
think<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.569> NX<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.049> going<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.500> end<00:03:46.650> up<00:03:46.829> being

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
think the NX is going to end up being

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.190 
think the NX is going to end up being
anyway<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:47.700> I'm<00:03:48.000> not<00:03:48.150> entirely<00:03:48.480> sure<00:03:48.780> if

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
anyway so I'm not entirely sure if

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.740 
anyway so I'm not entirely sure if
they're<00:03:49.380> going<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.769> do<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.340> whole<00:03:50.549> 3ds<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
they're going to do the whole 3ds on the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.930 
they're going to do the whole 3ds on the
big<00:03:51.930> screen<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.709> would<00:03:52.829> be<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.190> would<00:03:53.340> tear<00:03:53.700> up

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
big screen that would be I would tear up

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300 
big screen that would be I would tear up
the<00:03:54.209> resolution<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.200> mean<00:03:55.739> they've<00:03:55.889> done<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.220> in

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the resolution I mean they've done it in

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.039 
the resolution I mean they've done it in
the<00:03:56.400> past<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.090> Game<00:03:57.269> Boy<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> super
