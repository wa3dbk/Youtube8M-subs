00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.660
 Bird's eye 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.660
 Ten cases 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.299
 The gross national product was 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.299
 I will continue 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.849
 Kazuaki Fujii 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.189
 The coach did not match 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.769
 Japan is needed 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.369
 One after another 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.939
 Launched this policy 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.070
 At the time of purchase such as 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.140
 Actively attract foreign companies 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.620
 Current night 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.500
 I believe in the eve 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 Significantly reduced 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.060
 Leaving both parties 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.380
 release 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 Top Korean companies have made inroads 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.890
 So Malaysia is in the late 80's 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 Economic growth over 8% a year 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.860
 Economic growth host country team pulled 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.820
 Up to 1,500 companies 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.250
 It is a trademark at once 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.890
 New products are mostly made by major Japanese manufacturers 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.820
 I mean always have a high interest in 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.150
 Malaysia is 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.150
 Seven types that can supply TVs and video refrigerators 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.510
 that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.720
 takedown 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 I do not know the momentary moment 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.300
 a In parties such as Malaysia and other countries 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.200
 Exchange recall in the 1970s 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.050
 It is because Japan has relaxed restrictions on foreign capital 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.320
 It was time to get stuck with the foreign companies you started with 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.470
 As a result, acquisition of mobile sector for mac 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.650
 Especially in the famine district ruling party of the electric and electronics industry 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.330
 ing 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.880
 One of the world's leading third parties such as PC peripherals 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.290
 Became 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.770
 Everything became a lot of people here 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.519
 This is a round trip of gdp per person after I mentioned earlier 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.379
 Malaysia has been growing steadily since the 1970s 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.769
 Though 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.889
 Remarkable growth from the late 1960's to the early 90's 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.319
 Has become 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.420
 All of the countries that passed the mako were May in the country 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.430
 It does not mean that we are growing well like Malaysia 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.039
 But 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.589
 Gamepot is the home of the country Indonesia to bereaved 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:38.529
 Hey Was the fact that the temple in 1970 was only 16 extra tall? 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.189
 Has grown by 1,200 in 2005 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.900
 Overseas news from the rapid development in 25 years 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:48.519
 is not it 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.499
 Now this is due to the rapid industrialization of Southeast Asian countries 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.009
 Economic development 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
 I was also greatly influenced by the life of Kato Sennins 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.179
 Speaking of distant tendencies, first of all 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.459
 Not agriculture 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.269
 Or 10 people who work in the service department 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.349
 doing 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.699
 It is the number of people who live in the timing city which then goes up 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.809
 Especially to people from all over the world lol 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:21.089
 Many people are flowing from the surrounding rural areas and regions 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.089
 Suddenly the population is small 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.379
 Still, let's look at its use Indonesia as an example 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 Let's do it 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.349
 Indonesia is a big country in Southeast Asia, where mistress industrial high school 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.359
 Though 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.109
 There was gdp per capita 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.809
 Growth of around $ 1,040 and a quarter to a third of Daimaru's world 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.369
 Staying 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:50.119
 In addition, oil and natural gas are leading in many major exports. 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 The degree of dependence on mens 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.029
 Then look at the Western style of last year's class with vtr with a lot of eyes with vtr 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:03:59.399
 It was said that
