00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 any modern phone tablet 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 tv even some cars 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 it's not just a piece of iron this is a piece of iron 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.990
 with a processor and RAM and everything 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.719
 this is controlled by software 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.389
 providing any most powerful piece of hardware 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.609
 the coolest camera can be turned into 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.070
 unnecessary shit if it is on it 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.800
 buggy software installed that's why 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.210
 The task of the manufacturer includes not only 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.619
 release iron and collect denyushki 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.460
 quickly dump but also maintain 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.449
 software in 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 healthy up to date 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.100
 need to correct mistakes you can go 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.920
 on new versions of the operating system and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.590
 so on i have two phones in my hands 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 it is minuscule in which the test sample 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.800
 the engineering version is not final here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.879
 it was different but I'm on this one 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 the sample put the latest 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 firmware 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.340
 for December 17th these last so 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 what was the firmware here originally 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.440
 was just a super-phone is all well 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.260
 plug shaft camera worked awfully 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.780
 precisely because of buggy software and it 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.519
 the final version but the firmware is here for 18 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.990
 November I started testing it but 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 i'm told perry petitions myself 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 the latter because there is even better 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.430
 let me show you the process 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.500
 flashing it on exactly the firmware from 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 I have already rebuilt this manufacturer 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.570
 practiced therefore show 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.790
 First Deputy, you need to make sure that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 First you need to make sure that you at least 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 understand something in this matter all to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.700
 all that I am about to tell you is all 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 will do it you do on your 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.409
 fear and risk no liability 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.960
 I carry attack some video from me 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 they write that I spoiled a goat and 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.700
 tablet phone you are to blame for this 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.049
 i'm here 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.060
 how is it done but if you have your hands 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.079
 didn’t grow from there then I’m nothing 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.509
 I can not help 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.429
 excuse me you yourself took it 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.149
 reflash and so perry flash 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.829
 firmware 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.869
 November put the last detail 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.820
 Russian for flashing we need 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.880
 well clear phone and spicali 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.439
 and some laptop tablet 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.429
 desktop computer running 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.950
 windows 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.100
 turn off the phone make sure that he 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.049
 charged enough charged though in this 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.330
 case connects via usb will go 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:15.640
 charging I do not know why they ask for the full 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 charging in the case of this flashing I 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.530
 I will use the playground on us 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.950
 need flash tool 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.370
 I downloaded it from the Internet in the description 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.280
 there is where it can be downloaded more precisely as 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.959
 find him a direct link I do not give stick 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.459
 yusb cable and avoided should be 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.349
 tested and working because using 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.920
 non-working ashby cable can be killed 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.069
 devices 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.840
 I have already chosen here, but I need to understand 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.150
 from download new firmware link to 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.280
 new firmware specifically for this 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 The phone is in the description, see what 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.380
 need to do need to run flash tool 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.790
 select a file and asks he hope 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.700
 The only and anti 6592 android is 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.630
 file as it shows what will be 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.889
 reflash I will not go into 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.410
 the details are all very simple 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.870
 run this flashtool choose this 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.239
 file appears here such a list 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.530
 need to uncheck the first menu item 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:15.400
 the rest is left on the phone 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:20.049
 we press a minus and we connect all beat 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.769
 let's connect once connected and 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:28.720
 release the volume down 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:31.709
 was nothing happened because I did not 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.810
 installed drivers for this phone 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.120
 let's put the driver so how would it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.799
 do but I still forgot one moment here 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420
 before you stick it in here 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.569
 here can 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.170
 click to download as it is here now 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.130
 the program is ready to load new 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.020
 software new firmware 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.670
 on this phone but she still does not see 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.599
 this phone and she is waiting for this 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.459
 the phone will appear 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.440
 let's try to pick it up again 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.030
 I do it as I am alone 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:10.220
 the viewer asked why it does not work 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:13.200
 dad let go and right there come on a 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 after all, I did it again a year ago 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.560
 filmed how to reflash the phone and forgot 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.769
 mention that the driver must necessarily 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.900
 i stand your cpu and i have 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.240
 the viewer asks us why update 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.710
 drivers why it does not work for me 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.210
 because you just didn't set the edges 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.860
 I didn’t have a driver either 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.900
 that's why the device is just see 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.160
 starts charge to perform a search for drivers 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.680
 on this computer 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.930
 review i put these drivers i downloaded from 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.479
 Internet reference is in the description as 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.639
 you can also find these drivers 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.120
 download here let's remember 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.650
 device driver here's the truth ok 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.260
 then he looks for a server 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.090
 driver installation everything is ready 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.340
 tell you that the driver is not signed yet 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.100
 what is it like you yourself already in 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.900
 depending on the situation 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.539
 disassemble and because all provide 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 impossible now go back here 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.350
 here I clicked jumps download there 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:12.000
 flash click memesik and connect 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:16.650
 by the second beat vacation and cons and 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:23.690
 than the cases of the driver there we have already found 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.690
 And now the firmware should start waiting and 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.090
 no, it didn't work out 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.259
 he slept 5 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.879
 what 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.099
 It can be can be lead bad times 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:49.699
 let go again 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:52.189
 about the firmware went see here sometimes 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.289
 I have to sign with a tambourine, I do not 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.669
 I understand why one time work another 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.069
 time does not work at first appeared 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.469
 the red bar now goes yellow bar 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:03.050
 and then here a big public will be with 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:05.870
 tick ok let's flash 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.789
 wait wait for this moment 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.830
 better not hold anything so that everyone 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:11.810
 was charged in advance is not chopped off 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.020
 otherwise your phone may turn from 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.800
 brick 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.970
 everything is ready and the device immediately 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.639
 disconnected you can reboot it 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.860
 note that at the moment but 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.810
 everything is erased when flashing 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 all there were your photos and 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.110
 videos 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.879
 contacts unless you contact does not 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.659
 keep in a cloud gothic all all this 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.819
 is lost here 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.669
 so before doing this 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.159
 it is necessary to do everything for now 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.110
 you need everything now I will be again 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:49.389
 test more i will not new 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:51.460
 firmware wait for firmware 50 will appear 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.169
 android 50 will be unknown when 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.699
 so I will work on this kind of 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:56.699
 you said absolutely stable and
