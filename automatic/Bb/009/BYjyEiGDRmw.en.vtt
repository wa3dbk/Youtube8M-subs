00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
can't ray 850,000 in seven hours I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
can't ray 850,000 in seven hours I
really<00:00:32.669> should<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:33.570> making<00:00:33.960> videos<00:00:34.230> about

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
really should be not making videos about

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.910 
really should be not making videos about
rating<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.000> anyway<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.200> yeah

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
rating but anyway so there we go so yeah

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.190 
rating but anyway so there we go so yeah
just<00:00:38.129> building<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> loop<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.200> I've

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
just building up the loop really I've

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.850 
just building up the loop really I've
had<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> dump<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.399> some<00:00:41.969> walls

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
had to dump a little bit in some walls

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
had to dump a little bit in some walls
because<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.420> much

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this is a totally Mac that base I mean

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.240 
this is a totally Mac that base I mean
it's<00:01:54.509> insanely<00:01:55.470> Mac<00:01:55.770> self

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.090 

now<00:01:58.940> he's<00:01:59.120> not<00:01:59.330> just<00:01:59.570> falling<00:02:00.020> archers<00:02:00.890> all

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
now he's not just falling archers all

now he's not just falling archers all
the<00:02:01.400> way<00:02:01.550> around<00:02:01.640> he's<00:02:02.420> actually<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.750> lot<00:02:02.870> of

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the way around he's actually a lot of

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.420 
the way around he's actually a lot of
strategy<00:02:03.470> involved<00:02:03.740> here<00:02:04.010> so<00:02:04.130> he's<00:02:04.280> taking

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
strategy involved here so he's taking

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.910 
strategy involved here so he's taking
out<00:02:04.730> that<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:05.390> building<00:02:05.750> stuff<00:02:06.080> really<00:02:06.620> and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
out that the building stuff really and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.550 
out that the building stuff really and
Toby<00:02:07.340> unprotected<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.630> takes<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.080> lot<00:02:09.500> of

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
knowledge about whether you know where

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.500 
knowledge about whether you know where
the<00:02:11.750> distance<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.260> not<00:02:12.410> he's<00:02:13.280> not<00:02:13.520> treating

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
the distance is not he's not treating

level four th Queen let's see how fast

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.750 
level four th Queen let's see how fast
she<00:02:49.370> goes<00:02:49.520> down<00:02:50.020> 3<00:02:51.130> 2<00:02:52.130> 1<00:02:52.459> by<00:02:53.230> amazing<00:02:54.230> hey<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
she goes down 3 2 1 by amazing hey the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.790 
she goes down 3 2 1 by amazing hey the
artist<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:56.989> clearly<00:02:57.320> he's<00:02:58.160> throwing<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.610> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
artist so clearly he's throwing in the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.210 
artist so clearly he's throwing in the
golden<00:03:00.850> very<00:03:01.850> deep<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.930> triggers<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
golden very deep so triggers the the

golden very deep so triggers the the
crossbow

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.280 

so<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:10.970> already<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.300> twenty<00:03:11.540> percent<00:03:11.780> it's

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
so you already at twenty percent it's

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.620 
so you already at twenty percent it's
probably<00:03:12.380> used<00:03:12.680> half<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.010> these<00:03:13.099> trips<00:03:13.630> better

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
probably used half of these trips better

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.940 
probably used half of these trips better
they're<00:03:15.110> all<00:03:15.200> deployed<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.500> think<00:03:18.830> we've

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
they're all deployed then I think we've

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.440 
they're all deployed then I think we've
starts<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.520> other<00:03:19.730> side<00:03:20.000> pretty<00:03:20.420> soon
