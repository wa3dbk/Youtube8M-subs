like<00:07:28.620> he<00:07:28.770> does<00:07:29.039> in<00:07:29.220> the<00:07:29.310> movie<00:07:29.610> even<00:07:29.870> the

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870 
like he does in the movie even the

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.600 
like he does in the movie even the
latest<00:07:31.229> ones<00:07:31.440> don't<00:07:31.710> have<00:07:31.889> that<00:07:32.160> I<00:07:32.190> think

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610

that's<00:07:32.759> something<00:07:32.970> that<00:07:33.120> they<00:07:33.300> could<00:07:33.530> work<00:07:34.530> on

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
that's something that they could work on

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.499 
that's something that they could work on
in<00:07:34.949> the<00:07:35.069> future<00:07:35.099> but<00:07:35.639> I<00:07:35.699> definitely<00:07:35.970> prefer
