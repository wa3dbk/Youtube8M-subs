00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.879
 to mourn this terrible suffering but 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 well nothing happens but if you get there 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.670
 welcome to the beast escapes a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.110
 game mode that does a lot 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.210
 time that I do not bring to the channel 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.460
 would love would make me very happy that I could 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 give a lot of love to the video of guys 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 and girls that we can get to five 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 little hands up there is that there 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.600
 compaÃ±eras just killed you because you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.010
 I have seen many, as I am saying 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.409
 you think we can get to five 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.969
 handyman up I think people 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.829
 we can give you a lot 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.640
 very much love and sensual a love that 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.590
 before, poor thing, this fire that there is and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 fire and nothing else because he can not get out 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.039
 from there 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.829
 Run carefully and I hope that nobody 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.359
 no one is worth and it is repeated no one has arrived 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.399
 at the end because as it has reached 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.649
 final I really have it fucked up is to say 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.000
 because in the end they made us you know 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.009
 because long ago it not 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 game beast escape as there is a 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.569
 very good equipment barbarian for 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.189
 kill me obviously I do not want to see it 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.890
 because I wanted to do an episode of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.560
 beast doing good beast to kill 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 my enemies because it's more fun is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.549
 the beast that is the runner is worth ojito 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.679
 Judge me I think I would see a person and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.709
 well, it 's more fun to be a beast than 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.810
 runner then let's try to vale 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.879
 that our enemies do not see us 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.369
 equally better they have not reached the end 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.200
 because it seems very strange to me 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.659
 It seems very strange that there are not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.340
 listened to here still mare and not 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.590
 has already left the notification 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 that they had reached the middle and has not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.799
 come nobody in the middle better for me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.299
 It's better for me because that's how I can 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.660
 equip perfectly without any kind of 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.400
 stop 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.690
 for an occasion of probability not of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.460
 effort than a possible slowness 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 likewise I will remove giving it I'm going to 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.090
 put 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.710
 a is perfect sharp sword an arc 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.210
 perfect slowness strength and speed I'll 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.120
 to take another speed position by 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.710
 a force pressure and I'm more than 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.390
 ready for the final final battle of 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.280
 map let's go back to the end of the map 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.600
 to kill our enemies but 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.680
 I really do not know where he is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.410
 ok because it could be that they have 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.360
 hidden like the mop does not work 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.250

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.150
 hidden in some mysterious place I 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.310

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.460
 until this time I do not say this phrase 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.200
 because he used it a lot in escapes 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.640
 of the beast and yes it is true that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.320
 had escaped the beast very very 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.760
 abandoned but it 's a model that for me 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.260
 it was from my favorites then I 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.330
 I would love to see how I commented before 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.650
 home that supports it and a lot of power 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.690
 which is a game mode that I want 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.600
 start with good I want to live good 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.860
 attentive twink batman 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.360
 I think I just killed April what 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.580
 for example you feel you angry with me 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.050
 come back saying I said a phrase from 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.720
 nothing before it's worth but what I wanted to say 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.650
 I wanted to start climbing again 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.560
 escape from the beast because it is a 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.000
 favorite mode for then 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.350

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.820

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.710
 way to sneak - from this guy 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.420
 because there is more seen more seen at 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.120
 perfect I did not value that because 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.860
 for topics let's go back to be perfect 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.800
 to say any kind of problem wow 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.200
 ok we go back to no problem we take 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:51.730
 decoration positions perfect vale 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.730
 we take swords we take armor and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.720
 at first 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.160
 good to finish this video today 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.600
 we found the map well please 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.550
 sir there is one that a long time ago and 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 argued that I did not know about you but 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.530
 hey ojito is that in the end you just 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.420
 taking everything here is good you take 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.520
 to finish this video from today we 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.160
 we see on the map of iceland a map is worth 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.780
 that you just killed batman a 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.910
 map that the truth that is very cool 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.980
 ok it's a very cool map I do not know 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.500
 where are the other emails normally 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.760
 how fast they go they go very fast not for 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.220
 to have arrived there is good too 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.660
 that I'm out fifteen seconds more 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.820
 afternoon and takes the kids along very 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.120
 slow but this goes very fast flags 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.570
 he will not be able to climb on me 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:44.419
 it fell and it jumps jumps and it's perfect 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.160
 we go there and to a drum like 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.470
 teleported there is no kind of 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 problem because now I could catch myself 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.000
 things but this can kill like this 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.029
 eta 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.009
 you have to not get to that half short 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.869
 well , nothing happens, let's do 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.559
 one thing let's go running to lome 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.599
 saying 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.779
 here for the several armor the mature 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:08.339
 special is valid and a boy has already died 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.809
 boy the guy who was watching from me 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:12.089
 he has died obviously because he leaves 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:13.229
 super touched then at the minimum hit 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.240
 that is stuck on the ground because it has 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.339
 dead basically I'm not a vandal 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.000
 looking and a pair of pants I break things 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:26.330
 because if putt 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.090
 I think if I could have perfect here 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.139
 I have armor a complete note that I 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.389
 I'm going to put it right now 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.120
 so already a sword is perfect and a 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.280
 bow with infinity utility fire power 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.479
 I already have the same arch but I think 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.550
 that before had no arch, not before 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.319
 before I did not have a bow, use the button to 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.479
 start again but obviously not 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.860
 the button works , nothing happens, nothing happens 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:47.969
 absolutely nothing we are going to come back here 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.139
 the principle because the safest thing is that 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:50.759
 the boy ends up adding up there 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.120
 then at the time that I had it 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:57.820
 from agost 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:01.520
 and let's see 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:04.520
 for example here perfect 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.520
 I think it's worth I think that if I come by 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.840
 here stuck without any problem because 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.539
 I 'm not part of the scene a person 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.190
 special so much here is perfect and 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.470
 again the risk and so on can 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.770
 unless you let it ends up finding
