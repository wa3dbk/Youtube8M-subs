00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.770
 pizzaballa was very expensive 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.990
 exact so much is true that at school 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.180
 elementary had spread from me 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.530
 famously said when the classmate 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 discarded the pack of stickers 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:17.870
 the other one here is the lace ball 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 it is up to 3 trim trims 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.240
 no it is not because the pizzaballa does not exist 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 nobody had it in the whole school 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.450

 my best friend in life 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.530
 worst opponent in the field of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.960
 figurines because to me the pizzaballa of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.030
 rino cost 5 bags of marbles 650 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.369
 figurine and practically three albums 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.680
 complete and half of my snack for 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.680
 practically the whole school year 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 but then in the end the pizzaballa sky 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:06.350
 I had me 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:08.270
 here is the pizzaballa yes now you understand 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
 that if the pizzaballa didn't have it 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.030
 nobody wanted i wouldn't have paid 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.120
 so much and instead everyone wants the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.500

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.739
 increases law of demand e
