year<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.510> year<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.260> case<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:31.980> pretty

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
year to year in this case I was pretty

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.299 
year to year in this case I was pretty

twelve<00:02:29.550> percent<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.270> energy<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.660> we're

producing in this building these garage
doors<00:02:33.450> which<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:34.080> 30<00:02:34.950> foot<00:02:35.250> long<00:02:35.280> these<00:02:35.940> will

doors which are 30 foot long these will

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.750 
doors which are 30 foot long these will
be<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> controller<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.500> literally<00:02:38.459> come

be on a controller and literally come

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.750 
be on a controller and literally come
down<00:02:39.000> at<00:02:39.270> night<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.220> completely

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
down at night so that we can completely

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.250 
down at night so that we can completely
isolate<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.780> space<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.489> think<00:02:44.489> for<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:45.510> we

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
isolate the space I think for what we

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500 
isolate the space I think for what we
are<00:02:46.290> able<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.520> terms<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.270> quality

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
are able to do in terms of the quality

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.479 
are able to do in terms of the quality
of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.050> buildings<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.739> quality<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
of the buildings the quality of the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.030 
of the buildings the quality of the
design<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.480> timeframe<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.230> which<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.830> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
design the timeframe in which we do it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.370 
design the timeframe in which we do it
and<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.910> lead<00:02:54.150> component<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.080> talked

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
and this lead component that I talked

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870 
and this lead component that I talked
about<00:02:55.470> earlier<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:56.220> think<00:02:56.370> we're<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.820> only

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
about earlier I think we're the only

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:07.880 
about earlier I think we're the only
ones<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.330> world

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
