like<00:01:08.729> certain<00:01:09.030> aspects<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> game<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
like certain aspects of this game like

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
like certain aspects of this game like
for<00:01:10.560> example<00:01:10.650> cards<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> kind<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
for example cards will just have kind of

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.499 
for example cards will just have kind of
words<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.979> life<00:01:14.340> link<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
words on them like life link and you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120 
words on them like life link and you
just<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:16.110> wouldn't<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.950> you're

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
just don't wouldn't know if you're

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
just don't wouldn't know if you're
playing<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.490> you'd<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> search<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> up

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
playing like you'd have to search it up

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
playing like you'd have to search it up
but<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> game<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.009> zoom<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but in the game you just zoom in on a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
but in the game you just zoom in on a
card<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> press<00:01:21.570> right<00:01:21.869> bumper<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.770> that's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
card and press right bumper and that's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.770 
card and press right bumper and that's
going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> tell<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> exactly<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:24.479> life

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going to tell you exactly what life

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
going to tell you exactly what life
length<00:01:25.080> does<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> case<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.130> wondering

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
length does and in case you're wondering

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.890 
length does and in case you're wondering
it<00:01:26.640> makes<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> damage<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it makes it so that the damage is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200 
it makes it so that the damage is
converted<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> life<00:01:28.829> points<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> so

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
converted to life points for you so

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
converted to life points for you so
something<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> makes<00:01:31.579> just

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
something like that just makes just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.890 
something like that just makes just
having<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.680> Xbox<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> platform<00:01:35.900> just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
having it on the Xbox as a platform just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
having it on the Xbox as a platform just
makes<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.770> easy<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.490> learn<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
makes it really really easy to learn and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
makes it really really easy to learn and
also<00:01:39.299> more<00:01:39.450> interactive<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
also more interactive and it's just a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
also more interactive and it's just a
lot<00:01:41.490> more<00:01:41.610> fun<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.869> main<00:01:43.200> thing<00:01:43.439> I've

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
lot more fun like the main thing I've

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.720 
yeah your deck completely works together
and<00:03:16.630> there's<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.440> much<00:03:17.590> strategy<00:03:17.950> involved<00:03:18.580> it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
and there's so much strategy involved it

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.310 
and there's so much strategy involved it
is<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.300> bit<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.540> luck<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.200> your

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
is a little bit of luck like what your

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.810 
is a little bit of luck like what your
hands<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.770> what<00:03:20.980> cards<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.310> draw<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> your

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
hands are what cards you draw to your

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.410 
hands are what cards you draw to your
deck<00:03:22.090> but<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:23.110> can<00:03:23.260> also<00:03:23.410> manage<00:03:23.950> your<00:03:24.130> deck

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
deck but you can also manage your deck

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.730 
deck but you can also manage your deck
you<00:03:25.420> get<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> certain<00:03:25.900> set<00:03:26.230> cards<00:03:26.530> when<00:03:26.650> you

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
you get a certain set cards when you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.710 
you get a certain set cards when you
unlock<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> deck<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.640> every<00:03:28.030> time<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.270> win

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
unlock a deck and every time you win

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.100 
unlock a deck and every time you win
with<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.140> deck<00:03:29.440> you<00:03:30.190> unlock<00:03:30.550> more<00:03:31.150> cards<00:03:31.870> and

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
with that deck you unlock more cards and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.530 
with that deck you unlock more cards and
in<00:03:32.740> doing<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.430> increase<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.180> size<00:03:34.360> of

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
in doing so you increase the size of

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.840 
in doing so you increase the size of
your<00:03:34.570> deck<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> thing<00:03:35.590> is<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.890> can<00:03:36.070> take

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
your deck but the thing is you can take

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.880 
your deck but the thing is you can take
cards<00:03:37.180> out<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.660> your<00:03:37.780> deck<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.230> don't<00:03:38.620> like

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
cards out of your deck if you don't like

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.230 
cards out of your deck if you don't like
a<00:03:38.920> card<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.370> you're<00:03:39.490> like<00:03:39.610> I'm<00:03:39.760> never<00:03:39.940> going<00:03:40.180> to

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
a card if you're like I'm never going to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.090 
a card if you're like I'm never going to
use<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.600> card<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.320> take<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.680> out<00:03:41.830> of<00:03:41.890> your

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
deck and that makes it more likely to

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
deck and that makes it more likely to
