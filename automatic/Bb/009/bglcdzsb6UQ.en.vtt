mounted up on the ceiling fans so I'm

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.290 
mounted up on the ceiling fans so I'm
gonna<00:01:32.580> fake<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.880> focus<00:01:33.330> on<00:01:33.510> that<00:01:35.150> it's<00:01:36.150> got

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
gonna fake it focus on that it's got

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.250 
gonna fake it focus on that it's got

some little rubbery tabs on four corners
that<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.800> guess<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.460> help<00:01:41.670> keep<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.300> from

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
that I guess will help keep it from

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.780 
that I guess will help keep it from
scratching<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:45.110> screen<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.490> think<00:01:47.490> I'm

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
scratching on the screen I think I'm

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.750
