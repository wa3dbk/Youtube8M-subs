00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
original hair color except maybe a

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
which I really like this is probably the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.880

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
unfortunately it went a little too late

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.070

last<00:02:19.720> time<00:02:20.020> oh<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.210> very<00:02:22.450> damaging<00:02:22.930> my

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.620 
last time oh it's not very damaging my
hair<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.350> feel<00:02:23.710> still<00:02:24.100> pretty<00:02:24.430> soft<00:02:24.850> not<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> stop

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
hair I feel still pretty soft not a stop

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.830 
hair I feel still pretty soft not a stop
just<00:02:25.900> before<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.770> dyed<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:28.330> course<00:02:28.600> hair

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
just before I dyed it but of course hair

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.070 
just before I dyed it but of course hair
dye<00:02:29.020> is<00:02:29.200> literally<00:02:29.500> damaging<00:02:30.150> but<00:02:31.150> I've<00:02:31.840> heard

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
dye is literally damaging but I've heard

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.770 
dye is literally damaging but I've heard
that<00:02:32.290> Japanese<00:02:32.710> hair<00:02:32.920> dyes<00:02:33.270> are<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.330> little

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
that Japanese hair dyes are a little

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.850 
that Japanese hair dyes are a little
less<00:02:35.080> damaging<00:02:35.650> which<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.700> don't<00:02:37.000> mind<00:02:37.240> at<00:02:37.420> all

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
everything in the massaging motion helps

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.010 
everything in the massaging motion helps
so<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.970> color<00:03:46.180> is<00:03:46.390> very<00:03:46.570> even

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
so that the color is very even

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.920 
so that the color is very even
throughout<00:03:47.440> your<00:03:47.620> whole<00:03:47.830> head<00:03:48.070> and<00:03:48.930> basically

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
towards the end you should just fill in

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.640 
towards the end you should just fill in
on<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:54.340> hairline<00:03:54.640> or<00:03:55.209> anywhere<00:03:55.959> especially

then put it on top because it tends to

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.290 
then put it on top because it tends to
kind<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.080> fade<00:04:05.320> away<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> little<00:04:05.950> faster<00:04:06.489> I<00:04:09.300> left

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
kind of fade away a little faster I left

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.640 
kind of fade away a little faster I left
it<00:04:10.480> on<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:10.630> 20<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.470> 25<00:04:11.530> minutes<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:14.350> really
