white with this revision let's zoom out
a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.420> bit<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> better

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
a little bit see it you get a better

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.710 
a little bit see it you get a better
idea<00:01:24.860> try<00:01:25.860> power<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.030> model<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.689> the

left has not been activated so it's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
left has not been activated so it's
going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> take<00:01:30.000> us<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.329> bit<00:01:30.570> longer<00:01:31.049> but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120 
that were used to now a major difference
with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> iphone<00:01:55.049> 5<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> headphone<00:01:56.100> jack

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
with the iphone 5 is the headphone jack

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
with the iphone 5 is the headphone jack
tur<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.149> bottom<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.869> they've

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
tur is now at the bottom and they've

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
tur is now at the bottom and they've
also<00:01:58.560> gotten<00:01:58.920> rid<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.460> 30-pin<00:02:00.180> dock

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
also gotten rid of the 30-pin dock

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
also gotten rid of the 30-pin dock
connector<00:02:00.799> replacing<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.280> new

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
connector replacing it with a new

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.560 
connector replacing it with a new
lightning<00:02:03.180> connector<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.430> new<00:02:06.090> smaller

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
lightning connector so new smaller

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.710 
lightning connector so new smaller
connector<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.979> plug<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> there's<00:02:09.479> no

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
connector you can plug it in there's no

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
connector you can plug it in there's no
orientation<00:02:11.120> also<00:02:12.120> different<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
orientation also different is the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
orientation also different is the
new<00:02:14.099> SIM<00:02:14.340> card<00:02:14.579> which<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> nano<00:02:15.480> SIM<00:02:15.870> card<00:02:16.109> so

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
new SIM card which is a nano SIM card so

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.869 
new SIM card which is a nano SIM card so
you<00:02:16.290> won't<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.590> able<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.829> put<00:02:16.980> previous<00:02:17.489> iphone

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
you won't be able to put previous iphone

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.670 
you won't be able to put previous iphone
sim<00:02:18.180> cards<00:02:18.510> into<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.920> new<00:02:20.430> iphone<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> now

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
sim cards into this new iphone so now

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.860 
sim cards into this new iphone so now
proceeding<00:02:23.189> let's<00:02:23.420> let's<00:02:24.420> move<00:02:24.599> some<00:02:24.840> things

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
proceeding let's let's move some things

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
proceeding let's let's move some things
aside<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:26.129> some<00:02:26.430> comparisons<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.719> what<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
aside and do some comparisons so what I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.890 
aside and do some comparisons so what I
have<00:02:28.079> here<00:02:28.109> is<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.980> new<00:02:29.280> iphone<00:02:29.640> 5<00:02:29.879> and<00:02:30.209> i<00:02:30.719> have

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
an iphone 4s which then just came out

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.789 
an iphone 4s which then just came out
seems<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.269> just<00:02:36.569> yesterday<00:02:36.689> and<00:02:37.319> it's

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
seems like just yesterday and it's

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.539 
seems like just yesterday and it's
already<00:02:38.459> outdated<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.480> terrible<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:41.459> if

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
already outdated it's terrible now if

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.360 
already outdated it's terrible now if
you<00:02:41.639> look<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:41.849> these<00:02:41.939> two<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.840> iPhone<00:02:43.260> 5<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
you look at these two the iPhone 5 is I

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.190 
you look at these two the iPhone 5 is I
wouldn't<00:02:44.639> say<00:02:44.760> significantly<00:02:45.420> thinner<00:02:45.750> but

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
wouldn't say significantly thinner but

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.500 
wouldn't say significantly thinner but
it<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> when<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.159> holding<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.669> it<00:02:47.879> feels<00:02:48.269> a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it is when you're holding it it feels a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.819 
it is when you're holding it it feels a
lot<00:02:48.750> thinner<00:02:50.689> it's<00:02:51.689> also<00:02:51.870> lighter<00:02:52.200> which<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
lot thinner it's also lighter which I

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.440 
lot thinner it's also lighter which I
did<00:02:53.129> i<00:02:53.189> mention<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.579> it's<00:02:53.700> lighter<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.239> mean

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
did i mention that it's lighter I mean
