spin my body around the wall it's always

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
spin my body around the wall it's always
a<00:00:45.629> good<00:00:45.780> idea<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.140> figure<00:00:46.530> out<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.920> side<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

a good idea to figure out what side you
prefer<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:48.300> flip<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.050> gonna<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
prefer to side flip to it's gonna be the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.760 
prefer to side flip to it's gonna be the
exact<00:00:49.590> same<00:00:49.700> setup<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.289> if<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.649> my

jump at the wall and you want to be
forceful<00:02:19.109> with<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:20.159> get<00:02:20.280> too<00:02:20.430> close<00:02:20.579> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
forceful with it you get too close to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.770 
forceful with it you get too close to
the<00:02:20.790> wall<00:02:20.909> as<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.180> as<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.599> knock

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.270 
you over so you have to push the wall
away<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.739> left<00:02:25.889> hand<00:02:26.010> work

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
there's pushing away it's pushing away

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.349 
there's pushing away it's pushing away
not<00:02:28.620> coming<00:02:28.920> off<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.639> pushing<00:02:29.939> away<00:02:30.180> from

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
not coming off it's pushing away from

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.030 
not coming off it's pushing away from
you<00:02:30.719> getting<00:02:31.019> your<00:02:31.200> body<00:02:31.349> far<00:02:31.739> enough<00:02:31.889> away

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
from the wall so that you can spin over

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.490 
from the wall so that you can spin over
it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.709 
it
again<00:02:34.859> this<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.189> the<00:02:35.340> axis<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.329> is<00:02:36.389> what<00:02:36.629> you

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:36.719 
again this is the axis this is what you

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:42.349 
again this is the axis this is what you
spin<00:02:36.989> over<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:41.129> actual<00:02:41.459> execution<00:02:41.999> of<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
spin over the actual execution of it

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.940 
spin over the actual execution of it
here<00:02:42.810> are<00:02:42.900> some<00:02:43.049> tips<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.409> are<00:02:43.499> gonna<00:02:43.650> help

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
here are some tips that are gonna help

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.280 
here are some tips that are gonna help
you<00:02:44.069> with<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.359> so<00:02:45.359> instead<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.989> putting<00:02:46.139> your

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you with that so instead of putting your

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.050 
you with that so instead of putting your
left<00:02:46.439> hand<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.829> wall<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.760> learn<00:02:47.909> how<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
left hand on the wall to learn how to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.689 
left hand on the wall to learn how to
practice<00:02:48.359> this<00:02:48.780> put<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.980> ground<00:02:50.189> so

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:50.699 
practice this put it on the ground so

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:51.920 
practice this put it on the ground so
your<00:02:50.819> left<00:02:50.969> hand<00:02:51.090> will<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.449> on<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.689> ground

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
weight on that left hand to flip it

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.879 
weight on that left hand to flip it
around<00:02:58.969> so<00:02:59.969> again<00:03:00.239> left<00:03:01.230> hand<00:03:01.469> on<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.680> ground

around so again left hand on the ground

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.500 
around so again left hand on the ground
right<00:03:02.310> hand<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.699> wall<00:03:02.849> you're<00:03:03.419> gonna

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
right hand on the wall you're gonna

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.140 
right hand on the wall you're gonna
learn<00:03:03.659> how<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.810> push<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.889> now<00:03:08.669> like<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
learn how to push like that now like I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.280 
learn how to push like that now like I
said<00:03:09.299> all<00:03:09.510> your<00:03:09.659> weight<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.930> gonna<00:03:10.079> be<00:03:10.169> allowed

to<00:03:12.449> that<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.870> drill<00:03:13.139> is<00:03:13.169> great<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.590> build<00:03:13.799> up

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
to that that drill is great to build up

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.129 
to that that drill is great to build up
the<00:03:14.010> strength<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.150> technique<00:03:15.540> all<00:03:15.840> that

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
the strength and the technique all that

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.170 
the strength and the technique all that
changes<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.699> it's<00:03:17.819> going<00:03:17.939> to<00:03:18.000> come

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
changes now is that it's going to come

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.630 
changes now is that it's going to come
up<00:03:18.209> vertically

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.300 

so<00:03:27.180> notice<00:03:27.570> how<00:03:27.750> I'm<00:03:27.960> not<00:03:28.070> jumping<00:03:29.070> at<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
so notice how I'm not jumping at the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.220 
so notice how I'm not jumping at the
wall<00:03:29.640> from<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.880> far<00:03:30.060> distance<00:03:30.450> I'm<00:03:30.930> trying<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
wall from a far distance I'm trying to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.110 
wall from a far distance I'm trying to
get<00:03:31.320> pretty<00:03:31.560> snug<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.550> I'm<00:03:33.000> actually

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
get pretty snug to it and I'm actually

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.760 
get pretty snug to it and I'm actually
trying<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.480> jump<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.930> my<00:03:34.170> left<00:03:34.350> hand<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
trying to jump up to my left hand to

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.580 
trying to jump up to my left hand to
create<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.220> leverage<00:03:35.730> point<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.320> instead<00:03:37.530> of

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
create that leverage point so instead of

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.990 
create that leverage point so instead of
jumping<00:03:37.800> at<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.070> wall<00:03:38.190> with<00:03:38.310> low<00:03:38.580> you're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
jumping at the wall with low you're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.370 
jumping at the wall with low you're
actually<00:03:39.210> trying<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.390> jump<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
actually trying to jump up on to the

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.160 
actually trying to jump up on to the
wall<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.950> then<00:03:41.870> initiate<00:03:42.870> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
wall and then initiate it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.710 
wall and then initiate it
so<00:03:43.590> height<00:03:43.860> rather<00:03:44.490> than<00:03:44.790> super<00:03:45.330> manning<00:03:45.630> at

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
so height rather than super manning at

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:54.080 
so height rather than super manning at
it<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:50.550> that<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:51.210> how<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.420> do<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> wall<00:03:51.780> spin
