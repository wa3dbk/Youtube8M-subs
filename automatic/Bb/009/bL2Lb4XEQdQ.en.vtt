teleo printmaking we have our tarlatan

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.790 
teleo printmaking we have our tarlatan
it's<00:00:08.099> been<00:00:08.880> balled<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.330> get<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.440> hand<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
it's been balled up get in the hand we

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.589 
it's been balled up get in the hand we
have<00:00:10.950> our<00:00:11.070> pot<00:00:11.280> plate<00:00:11.550> which<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.389> slightly

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
have our pot plate which is slightly

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.720 
have our pot plate which is slightly
warm<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.769> keep<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> plate<00:00:14.250> hot<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.700> that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
warm just to keep the plate hot so that

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.880 
warm just to keep the plate hot so that
you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.089> move<00:00:15.269> around<00:00:15.360> we<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:16.379> our<00:00:16.500> plate<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
you can move around we got our plate and

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
you can move around we got our plate and
it's<00:00:17.039> inked<00:00:17.369> up<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> few<00:00:18.510> different

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it's inked up there's a few different

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
it's inked up there's a few different
techniques<00:00:18.840> wiping<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> plate<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.670> to

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
techniques wiping the plate is going to

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
techniques wiping the plate is going to
be<00:00:20.850> different<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.330> every<00:00:21.630> plate<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.230> do

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
be different for every plate that you do

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
be different for every plate that you do
you<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.830> need<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> print<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.490> kind<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> see

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
you just need to print and kind of see

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.370 
you just need to print and kind of see
what<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.990> plate<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.320> doing<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.890> then<00:00:27.380> keep

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
what the plate is doing and then keep

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.910 
what the plate is doing and then keep
going<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.599> scrub<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> ink<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
going so you can scrub in the ink that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
going so you can scrub in the ink that
helps<00:00:32.250> even<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> little<00:00:33.030> bit<00:00:33.270> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
helps even it out a little bit I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.049 
helps even it out a little bit I
generally<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.770> get<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.670> wiping

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
generally like to just get in to wiping

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
generally like to just get in to wiping
the<00:00:36.210> idea<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> wrist<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the idea is that it's in the wrist and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
the idea is that it's in the wrist and
keep<00:00:38.910> moving<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> sweeping<00:00:39.809> pattern<00:00:40.200> always

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
keep moving in a sweeping pattern always

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
keep moving in a sweeping pattern always
starting<00:00:41.280> off<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> plate<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.059> ending<00:00:42.600> off

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
starting off the plate and ending off

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
starting off the plate and ending off
the<00:00:42.989> plate<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.700> motion<00:00:48.030> like

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the plate so it's just a motion like

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.250 
the plate so it's just a motion like
this<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:50.670> keep<00:00:51.059> turning<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.539> plate<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this we keep turning the plate as you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:04.030 
this we keep turning the plate as you
need<00:00:52.440> to

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.860 

now<00:01:04.610> we're<00:01:04.730> using<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:05.000> pretty<00:01:05.240> already

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
now we're using a pretty already

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.370 
now we're using a pretty already
saturated<00:01:06.170> tarlatan<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.190> can<00:01:07.340> see<00:01:07.600> incas<00:01:08.600> is

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
saturated tarlatan you can see incas is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.960 
saturated tarlatan you can see incas is
getting<00:01:09.710> an<00:01:09.800> iron<00:01:09.980> on<00:01:10.370> there<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:10.730> what<00:01:10.850> you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
getting an iron on there so what you

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660 
getting an iron on there so what you
want<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> do<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:11.510> just<00:01:11.690> move<00:01:11.810> around<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:13.310> a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
want to do is just move around to a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.720 
want to do is just move around to a
cleaner<00:01:14.030> part<00:01:14.590> now<00:01:15.590> we're<00:01:16.220> gonna<00:01:16.310> pull<00:01:16.580> off<00:01:16.700> a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
cleaner part now we're gonna pull off a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:25.780 
cleaner part now we're gonna pull off a
little<00:01:17.030> more<00:01:17.300> ink<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.250> first<00:01:25.550> wave

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
little more ink and this this first wave

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.580 
little more ink and this this first wave
if<00:01:25.910> it's<00:01:26.120> going<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.390> get<00:01:26.510> some<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.260> excess

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
if it's going to get some of the excess

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.340 
if it's going to get some of the excess
ink<00:01:27.860> off<00:01:28.100> get<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.610> aint<00:01:28.790> down<00:01:29.690> on<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.900> crevices

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
ink off get to aint down on the crevices

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.320 
ink off get to aint down on the crevices
move<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.800> around<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.730> already<00:01:32.000> start<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.240> see

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
move it around you already start to see

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.050 
move it around you already start to see
the<00:01:32.900> image<00:01:33.200> coming<00:01:33.440> through<00:01:33.740> there<00:01:33.940> now<00:01:34.940> we're

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
the image coming through there now we're

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.770 
the image coming through there now we're
going<00:01:35.180> to<00:01:35.270> about<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.690> point<00:01:35.750> want<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.440> switch

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
going to about that point want to switch

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.690 
going to about that point want to switch
to<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> less<00:01:38.990> saturated<00:01:39.500> tarlatan<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.310> slowly

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
to a less saturated tarlatan and slowly

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.010 
to a less saturated tarlatan and slowly
get<00:01:41.090> cleaner<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.600> cleaner<00:01:41.780> with<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
get cleaner and cleaner with the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.280 
get cleaner and cleaner with the
tarlatan<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:43.640> one's<00:01:43.820> ready<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.120> go<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.200> you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
tarlatan this one's ready to go and you

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.140 
tarlatan this one's ready to go and you
can<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.650> it's<00:01:48.830> pulling<00:01:49.130> off<00:01:49.220> more<00:01:49.490> ink<00:01:49.700> or<00:01:49.940> get

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
can see it's pulling off more ink or get

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.730 
can see it's pulling off more ink or get
more<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.660> image<00:01:50.930> showing<00:01:51.380> through<00:01:51.590> there

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
more of the image showing through there

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.820 
more of the image showing through there
and<00:01:52.550> again<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.000> keep<00:01:53.470> turning<00:01:54.470> around<00:01:54.590> and

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and again just keep turning around and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.680 
and again just keep turning around and
make<00:01:54.950> sure<00:01:54.979> you're<00:01:55.280> starting<00:01:55.880> off<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.420> plate

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
make sure you're starting off the plate

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.620 
make sure you're starting off the plate
and<00:01:56.960> ending<00:01:57.440> off<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.280> plate<00:01:58.550> if<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.270> stop<00:01:59.510> on

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and ending off the plate if you stop on

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
and ending off the plate if you stop on
the<00:01:59.750> plate<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.140> actually<00:02:00.560> will<00:02:01.010> leave<00:02:01.220> ink<00:02:01.520> on

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the plate you actually will leave ink on

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.700 
the plate you actually will leave ink on
on<00:02:02.119> there<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.600> actually<00:02:02.750> see<00:02:02.960> some<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.619> the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
on there and actually see some of the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:28.210 
on there and actually see some of the
pattern<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.190> tarlatan
