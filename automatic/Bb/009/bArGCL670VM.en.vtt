00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
to do was composing so that's what I

to do was composing so that's what I
gravitated<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.570> course<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.430 

I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.900> what<00:01:17.020> I<00:01:17.520> did<00:01:18.520> was<00:01:18.760> recognized<00:01:19.690> my

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
I think what I did was recognized my

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.860 
I think what I did was recognized my
early<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.850> little<00:01:22.120> too<00:01:22.630> early<00:01:22.660> in<00:01:23.560> truth

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
early and a little too early in truth

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.380 
early and a little too early in truth
but

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
but

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
but
and<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.320> etymological<00:01:29.190> composing<00:01:29.729> is

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and it's not etymological composing is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
and it's not etymological composing is
not<00:01:29.970> something<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:31.110> evenly<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
not something that you can be evenly the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
not something that you can be evenly the
busiest<00:01:32.070> composer<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.640> world<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.000> I'll<00:01:33.150> be
