00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.230
 it is true what many say in this 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 generation of consoles we are suffering 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 a whole invasion of remastering is 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.710
 of games that we have already enjoyed in their 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 original platforms and that in this 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.360
 good occasion they want us to come back 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 to enjoy not good one of these cases 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.949
 is this uncharted by nathan drake 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.590
 collection a collection a 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.289
 compilation of the one charter that already 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.480
 we play on playstation3 and that in this 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.220
 occasion they come to playstation 4a and in 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 those images that we see right now in 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.469
 the screen we are seeing a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.829
 comparative between the original 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.750
 playstation 3 and playstation 4 is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 a lot of attention because it's true that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 differences a bit can be noticed 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 also through youtube less still 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 but it is true that they are palpable 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.010
 in some aspects but the question that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.260
 launched the next one you really think that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 it's worth the change it deserves 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 It's worthwhile to buy these titles again 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.250
 in this compilation the title is at 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 around the corner and also I think 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.520
 that also the remasters in 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 this case they serve a little then for 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.870
 prepare us for the next title that goes to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.910
 receive that in this 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.010
 You already know the fourth installment of 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.770
 uncharted on playstation 4 is not going to be 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.240
 the first uncharted really despite 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.910
 that will attract us first this 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.620
 compilation good as many say 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.170
 which is an easy way to earn money or 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.630
 take compilations from digital 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.910
 foundry have been taken away has been 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.120
 out this comparative of the anthology 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.920
 that will appear on playstation 4 now 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.780
 attentive because some moments appear 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 that we live in a charter compared 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.820
 between playstation 3 and playstation 4 there 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.670
 many improvements not only have to do 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.690
 with the 1080p resolution and with the 60 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.300
 frames per second 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.390
 there are some objects that have been much 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.220
 more detailed by lighting parts 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 grants rooms and environments a 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 look much more natural in this 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.860
 occasion the cinematics have a 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.440
 palpable depth of field that 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.820
 appreciates with nathan and sully in the new 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.130
 edition at the end of the truth 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 everything because I do not know if you think that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.920
 it's worth it or not but of course 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.289
 this is the comparative this is what is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 You can see the difference between a 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.490
 version and many others will say good then 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.010
 in fact I included myself among those many 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.950
 yes yes I have already enjoyed it in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.230
 playstation3 because I'm going to buy another 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.940
 time the same thing in playstation 4 is not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.860
 true that if you have not had it if not or 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.209
 if you enjoyed it and did not buy it and what 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.100
 you want to have it is a good one 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.440
 opportunity to buy it not in fact 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.300
 a good excuse but but good is that 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.950
 give the debate as always the truth is 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 that whenever we deal with this topic 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.930
 we go to the I think we always go to 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.390
 same debate not to whether it's worth it or not 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.860
 buy a remastering here we are 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.120
 seeing the difference here for example in 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.800
 this image that is coming out now 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360
 yes, it is true that it is much more 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.160
 realistic playstation 4 version 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.400
 because the other one seems like much more 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.160
 washed as much more little detailed in 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.250
 definitive but obviously something something 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.480
 they had to have done so that 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.709
 justify a little the purchase not so that 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.019
 we go to the store and with 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.730
 prices again these titles me the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.010
 I have on playstation3 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.989
 I do not think I bought them on PlayStation 4 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.510
 at least for the moment and well then 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.580
 you have the decision there 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.409
 you have the comparison in scenes like 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.750
 You certainly do notice a lot 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.690
 when there are many effects and others yes 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.940
 the improvement of the version of 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 playstation 4 but we'll be good 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.810
 pending more information about 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.060
 this anthology to see what price goes out 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.150
 definitely and very soon what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.950
 we received so we save on those 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.629
 pockets if you have not enjoyed a 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.010
 saga like this because this is the best 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:43.010
 opportunity without a doubt 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.010
 yes
