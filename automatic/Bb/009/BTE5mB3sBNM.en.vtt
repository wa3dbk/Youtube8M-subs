00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.049
 hello how are we the night is something of 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.629
 today again lending a 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:09.670
 soccer training today dedicated 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.500
 specifically futsal that is 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.570
 another discipline that I also develop and 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.520
 I work in the pedagogical university 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.100
 today I am going to bring you a session of 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.530
 football training come out we're going 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.870
 to see several elements of which it consists 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.430
 a soccer practice as the part that 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.070
 are doing them is a part of 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.770
 warm-up heating in the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.730
 who does a little aerobic work 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.980
 Later we will do other 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.350
 actions to follow up on a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.870
 normal process of a class of a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.600
 training to prepare the organism 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.890
 at a high intensity and subsequently 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 other activities 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.440
 after a slight warm-up 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.960
 to prepare the muscles 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.310
 gradually we go to a warm up 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.290
 that I prefer to do in a way 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.540
 most active where we are going to do a series 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.730
 of exercises to go forcing the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.410
 muscles to prepare for as I say 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.590
 a greater effort that comes later 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.870
 We do a series of exercises that 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.550
 they are allowing them to stimulate 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.500
 muscle areas that interest us most 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.510
 in this sense we are doing 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.870
 exercises in the lower train for 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.580
 work then the elements that we are going to 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.950
 use in the game let's make a 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.619
 series of exercises that you 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.390
 you can see today because at least not 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.570
 I particularly recommend the work 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.520
 stretching or warming 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.290
 active truth you always have to stretch 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.210
 you always have to work with flexibility 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.390
 but we can see a series of exercises 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.910
 that we do it with some intensity 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.860
 certain volume that allows us a greater 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.860
 provision for training 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.710
 after we have done both 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.060
 Previous heating stations 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.490
 let's start working with the ball 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.649
 doing displacement exercises 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.729
 and go playing the ball little by little 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.729
 wire for the bar 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.060
 in this exercise you can at the same time 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.129
 let's work a little bit the speed 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.080
 Well, we are working on the two profiles 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.850
 for example to this couple once more 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.560
 this goal on the right side the other with the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.780
 left and in the next one when changing 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.060
 the return we do it by the shore 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.160
 because color is made and as we see the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.930
 player here so as not to affect the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.810
 colleagues who are working then 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.780
 It is a warm how can 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.450
 degree account little by little we are demanding 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.280
 greater the motor part to our 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.670
 organism to be ready to what 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.670
 It comes after 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.910
 every coach has his way of seeing 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.580
 the practices of seeing the development of 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.650
 the physical qualities if you 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.240
 we base with you a retrospective 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 we realize that they started with a 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.070
 continuous trot later we made a 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.320
 active warming after we work 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.760
 with half court ball there is a court 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.590
 doing driving and traveling in 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.690
 speed after this that the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.450
 intensity was high we do a job 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.480
 of flexibility because it is important to 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.580
 flexibility important flexibility 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.800
 because it allows to have a range of 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.240
 wider movement in 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.460
 displacements or in the actions of 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.500
 game and it's important also up to 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.300
 the prevention of injuries because I do 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.610
 at this moment I do it at this moment 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.370
 because the body is already ready is 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.680
 prepared to make a greater effort and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.050
 the movements can be wider 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 then after all we finished 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.490
 of doing we make a station of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.250
 flexibility to make way for work 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.110
 technical physicist which will go in 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.320
 sequences and gradual increase of 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 requirement in the speed part and 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.880
 the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.880
 but at the marq 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.790
 I am a lover of physical work with 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.709
 intensity and I really like to work 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.590
 this part of the training is part 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.229
 physical with value in the time of yesteryear 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.169
 since the physical part of the list was 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.509
 totally rigid and without the ball 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.490
 I usually work those elements with 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.919
 balls we make the first sequence 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.380
 I'm working the speed if it 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.820
 set in two rows leads in speed 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.750
 and more or less to three quarters of court 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.550
 shoots more coming out one from each row of 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.169
 transforms to follow up but what 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.900
 I'm interested here beyond the shot and 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.790
 the work of the goalkeeper 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.430
 what is reaction is the work of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.740
 speed we do to move 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.720
 approximately 25 or 30 meters and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.780
 work shoot badly 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.950
 We are going to do this for 5 minutes and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.420
 At the same time, young people are already 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.240
 heating to go doing others 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.710
 exercises that come gradually 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.530
 when one trains goes looking 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.380
 exercises that go from a difficulty 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.850
 smaller to a greater then the idea here 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.880
 in this work is speed of 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.930
 displacement 25 or 30 meters and finish 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.930
 with a soul shot 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.070
 first variant of location in 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.950
 phase speed the player who is 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.700
 opposite and this one returns the wall this 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.440
 it's a support action 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.920
 with the player who is in the position 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.690
 final that is called the player pivot 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.650
 always leads and ends with shots 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.870
 let's see here pass wall and shot the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.960
 player after a shot places the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.090
 position that he was doing pivot 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.980
 we look at the player who shot is located 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.940
 in the center and is the one that will return 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.940
 the ball to the next 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.550
 it's a completion exercise but 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:57.020
 including a high physical part 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.919
 intensity phase of evolution driving 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:04.309
 and good shot time contributions 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.139
 it's going to be a variant plus the same pass 

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:08.309
 I return only now the player 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.050
 returns the one who was in the position and 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:12.599
 he finishes the play we see him from another 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.669
 side pass of evolution another pass on 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.080
 depth or space and the player 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.089
 that was in the center is the one 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.679
 finish the shot play look 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.659
 we try to demand that they do so 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:24.209
 first intention to do it fast 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:26.219
 that they always do it for the 3rd floor more 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:28.379
 easy we have control of the ball 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:31.709
 it is easier for us to control it and 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.019
 let's finish the play then they are three 

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:36.839
 variants that says I can do many 

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:38.849
 more but I do these exercises 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.229
 these videos to be a guideline for 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.370
 you and you do others 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.229
 movements 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.729
 what is vital and is decisive that 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.949
 understand that this type of work 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.560
 develops the technical part a 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.780
 very high requirement in the physical part and 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.150
 we use the player specifically 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.720
 in soccer-room that decision-making 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.960
 and the action must be maximum speed 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.080
 okay 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.070
 we were there we see we are in 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.070
 the next video
