00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.810 

these<00:00:14.050> are<00:00:14.290> really<00:00:14.889> great<00:00:15.040> vases<00:00:15.549> they're

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
these are really great vases they're

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.910 
these are really great vases they're
like<00:00:16.029> three<00:00:16.420> put<00:00:17.050> together<00:00:17.200> this<00:00:17.680> whole

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
like three put together this whole

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.609 
like three put together this whole
collection<00:00:18.100> is<00:00:18.550> called<00:00:18.760> silo<00:00:19.380> some<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.500> them

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
collection is called silo some of them

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.550 
collection is called silo some of them
have<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:20.980> silky<00:00:21.490> beaded<00:00:22.390> texture<00:00:22.990> some<00:00:23.439> of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
have that silky beaded texture some of

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.380 
have that silky beaded texture some of
them<00:00:23.680> are<00:00:23.830> just<00:00:24.009> dis<00:00:24.250> platinum<00:00:24.820> these<00:00:25.180> are<00:00:25.360> a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
them are just dis platinum these are a

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.940 
them are just dis platinum these are a
little<00:00:25.509> bit<00:00:25.720> squatter<00:00:26.110> you<00:00:26.320> can<00:00:26.500> see<00:00:26.740> they're

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
little bit squatter you can see they're

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.890 
little bit squatter you can see they're
a<00:00:26.980> little<00:00:27.040> bit<00:00:27.340> shorter<00:00:27.790> great<00:00:28.630> as<00:00:28.869> a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
a little bit shorter great as a

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.290 
a little bit shorter great as a
combination<00:00:29.320> because<00:00:30.130> this<00:00:30.430> actually<00:00:30.970> pulls

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
combination because this actually pulls

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.600 
combination because this actually pulls
that<00:00:31.599> exact<00:00:32.349> color<00:00:32.619> of<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.890> beading<00:00:33.220> on<00:00:33.340> there

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
that exact color of the beading on there

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.049 
that exact color of the beading on there
so<00:00:34.210> you<00:00:34.239> can<00:00:34.540> do<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.870> as<00:00:35.050> a<00:00:35.079> varying<00:00:36.059> finishes

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
so you can do it as a varying finishes

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.090 
so you can do it as a varying finishes
and<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.510> could<00:00:37.660> work<00:00:37.840> very<00:00:38.140> well<00:00:38.200> as<00:00:38.649> well

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
and it could work very well as well

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.180 
and it could work very well as well
those<00:00:39.670> are<00:00:39.880> same<00:00:40.120> one<00:00:40.329> on<00:00:40.540> one<00:00:40.960> in<00:00:41.410> pairs<00:00:41.800> and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
those are same one on one in pairs and

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.580 
those are same one on one in pairs and
then<00:00:42.460> there's<00:00:42.760> one<00:00:43.000> two<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.600> three<00:00:44.110> grouping

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
then there's one two and three grouping

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.799 
then there's one two and three grouping
now<00:00:45.070> these<00:00:45.370> are<00:00:45.579> interconnected<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.660> just

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
now these are interconnected so you just

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.599 
now these are interconnected so you just
have<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.109> fill<00:00:47.289> in<00:00:47.440> one<00:00:47.710> hole<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.250> fills<00:00:48.550> the

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
have to fill in one hole it fills the

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.250 
have to fill in one hole it fills the
whole<00:00:48.850> thing<00:00:49.089> which<00:00:49.269> is<00:00:49.420> also<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.839> very<00:00:50.140> very

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
whole thing which is also a very very

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.060 
whole thing which is also a very very
nice<00:00:50.679> perk<00:00:51.749> in<00:00:52.749> this<00:00:52.989> particular<00:00:53.320> design<00:00:53.829> what

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
nice perk in this particular design what

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.470 
nice perk in this particular design what
I'm<00:00:54.190> going<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.399> do<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.699> create<00:00:54.940> something<00:00:55.449> that

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
I'm going to do is create something that

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.770 
I'm going to do is create something that
looks<00:00:55.839> really<00:00:55.960> quite<00:00:56.469> big<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.399> almost<00:00:58.149> heavy

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
looks really quite big and almost heavy

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.410 
looks really quite big and almost heavy
because<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.309> thickness<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.969> these<00:01:01.179> fibers

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
because the thickness of these fibers

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.540 
because the thickness of these fibers
sticks<00:01:01.899> are<00:01:02.140> such<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.769> looks<00:01:03.039> like<00:01:03.159> it's

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
sticks are such that it looks like it's

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.520 
sticks are such that it looks like it's
a<00:01:03.670> really<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> heavy<00:01:04.300> stick<00:01:04.720> but<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.110> really<00:01:05.320> is

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
a really a heavy stick but it really is

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.860 
a really a heavy stick but it really is
an<00:01:05.710> exodus<00:01:06.100> but<00:01:06.340> also<00:01:06.550> as<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.390> name<00:01:07.420> says

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
an exodus but also as the name says

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.620 
an exodus but also as the name says
fiber<00:01:08.200> stick<00:01:08.530> it's<00:01:08.710> very<00:01:09.100> light<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.510> it

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
fiber stick it's very light and so it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.330 
fiber stick it's very light and so it
doesn't<00:01:10.810> impose<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.290> lot<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.710> problem<00:01:12.159> with

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
doesn't impose a lot of problem with

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.300 
doesn't impose a lot of problem with
weight<00:01:12.970> and<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:14.080> what<00:01:14.380> I'm<00:01:14.500> gonna<00:01:14.680> do<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.040> just

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
weight and so what I'm gonna do is just

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.040 
weight and so what I'm gonna do is just
sort<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.520> create<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> simple<00:01:16.330> armature<00:01:16.810> that's

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
sort of create a simple armature that's

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.730 
sort of create a simple armature that's
kind<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.520> sort<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.610> random<00:01:19.300> kind<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.320> neat<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
kind of sort of random kind of neat and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.420 
kind of sort of random kind of neat and
then<00:01:21.730> weave<00:01:22.660> metal<00:01:23.200> Ino<00:01:23.470> through<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.100> tie

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
then weave metal Ino through it and tie

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.340 
then weave metal Ino through it and tie
it<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.420> can<00:01:25.600> do<00:01:25.720> something<00:01:25.930> again

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
it in so that you can do something again

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.290 
it in so that you can do something again
very<00:01:26.680> simple<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.310> doesn't<00:01:27.700> use<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> lot<00:01:28.270> of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
very simple that doesn't use a lot of

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.600 
very simple that doesn't use a lot of
product<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.470> I'm<00:01:29.590> just<00:01:29.770> gonna<00:01:29.920> sort<00:01:30.190> of<00:01:30.220> start

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
product so I'm just gonna sort of start

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.570 
product so I'm just gonna sort of start
to<00:01:30.670> tie<00:01:30.970> this<00:01:31.030> together<00:01:31.690> so<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.860> it<00:01:33.340> creates

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
to tie this together so that it creates

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.010 
to tie this together so that it creates
a<00:01:33.940> grid<00:01:34.240> into<00:01:35.140> which<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.680> will<00:01:36.040> then<00:01:36.810> time<00:01:37.810> it'll

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
a grid into which I will then time it'll

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.650 
a grid into which I will then time it'll
lino<00:01:38.380> into<00:01:38.740> so<00:01:38.950> obviously<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.700> tie<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.240> this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
lino into so obviously just tie in this

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.290 
lino into so obviously just tie in this
one<00:01:40.900> spot<00:01:41.260> seems<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.920> trick<00:01:42.040> there<00:01:42.490> and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
one spot seems to do the trick there and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.150 
one spot seems to do the trick there and
they're<00:01:43.570> not<00:01:43.780> gonna<00:01:43.930> take<00:01:44.170> just<00:01:44.470> few<00:01:44.740> piece<00:01:45.010> of

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
they're not gonna take just few piece of

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.130 
they're not gonna take just few piece of
the<00:01:45.250> middlee<00:01:45.610> by<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.850> time<00:01:46.150> some<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.570> which<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the middlee by the time some of which I

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.040 
the middlee by the time some of which I
will<00:01:47.470> actually<00:01:48.070> put<00:01:48.340> into<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.330> base<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:49.900> that

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
will actually put into the base so that

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.140 
will actually put into the base so that
it<00:01:50.170> starts<00:01:50.500> with<00:01:50.830> something<00:01:51.370> like<00:01:51.760> this<00:01:51.940> one

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
it starts with something like this one

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.610 
it starts with something like this one
here<00:01:52.510> I'm<00:01:52.690> not<00:01:52.870> going<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.050> really<00:01:53.260> end<00:01:53.470> up

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
here I'm not going to really end up

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.970 
here I'm not going to really end up
using<00:01:53.860> using<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.700> as<00:01:54.930> source<00:01:55.930> for<00:01:56.170> flowers<00:01:56.590> I'm

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
using using it as source for flowers I'm

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.560 
using using it as source for flowers I'm
going<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.280> probably<00:01:57.460> use<00:01:57.760> it<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.240> was<00:01:58.330> just

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
going to probably use it I was just

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.060 
going to probably use it I was just
slipping<00:02:00.420> beargrass<00:02:01.420> through<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.080> all<00:02:02.380> so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
slipping beargrass through that's all so

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.130 
slipping beargrass through that's all so
I'm<00:02:03.220> gonna<00:02:03.310> use<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:04.180> if<00:02:04.300> I<00:02:04.480> kind<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.870> flex

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
I'm gonna use that and if I kind of flex

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.230 
I'm gonna use that and if I kind of flex
it<00:02:05.320> like<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.010> actually<00:02:06.580> helps<00:02:06.940> push

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it like this this actually helps push

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.960 
it like this this actually helps push
this<00:02:07.540> out<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.920> stays<00:02:09.250> more<00:02:09.640> out

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
this out so that it stays more out

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.330 
this out so that it stays more out
instead<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.840> bringing<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.099> have

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
instead of bringing it in so you have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.940 
instead of bringing it in so you have
some<00:02:12.550> control<00:02:12.940> over<00:02:13.050> how<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.110> how<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> middle

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
some control over how the how the middle

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.339 
some control over how the how the middle
inna<00:02:15.250> flows<00:02:15.670> by<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.000> way<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.269> use<00:02:16.810> this

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
inna flows by the way you use this

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.729 
inna flows by the way you use this
material<00:02:18.629> so<00:02:19.629> this<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.650> I'm

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
material so this is kind of what I'm

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.530 
material so this is kind of what I'm
gonna<00:02:20.890> do<00:02:21.069> just<00:02:21.099> kind<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.969> sweep<00:02:22.239> around

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
gonna do just kind of sweep around

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.199 
gonna do just kind of sweep around
and<00:02:23.689> by<00:02:24.430> tying<00:02:25.430> into<00:02:25.790> different<00:02:26.060> places

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
and by tying into different places

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.270 
and by tying into different places
you're<00:02:26.719> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.110> different<00:02:27.379> flex<00:02:27.950> on

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
you're going to get different flex on

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520 
you're going to get different flex on
the<00:02:28.790> phone<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.150> finish<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:29.930> middlee<00:02:30.349> no

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
the phone the finish of the middlee no

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.949 
the phone the finish of the middlee no
and<00:02:30.799> you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.430> adjust<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.480> bit<00:02:32.689> of<00:02:32.810> it

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
and you can adjust it a little bit of it

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.440 
and you can adjust it a little bit of it
afterwards<00:02:33.680> too<00:02:34.099> because<00:02:34.519> after<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.879> tie<00:02:35.180> like

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
afterwards too because after I tie like

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.250 
afterwards too because after I tie like
this<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.989> could<00:02:36.200> still<00:02:36.500> pull<00:02:36.969> one<00:02:37.969> of<00:02:38.150> these<00:02:38.299> so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
this I could still pull one of these so

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.289 
this I could still pull one of these so
that<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.829> can<00:02:40.159> get<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.609> little<00:02:40.819> bit<00:02:41.060> more

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
that I can get a little bit more

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.110 
that I can get a little bit more
tightness<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.079> one<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.950> other<00:02:43.120> and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
tightness to one and then the other and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.420 
tightness to one and then the other and
I<00:02:44.359> take<00:02:44.540> another<00:02:44.810> grouping<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.590> maybe<00:02:45.859> two

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I take another grouping of it maybe two

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.849 
I take another grouping of it maybe two
or<00:02:46.640> three<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> time<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:48.500> seems<00:02:48.769> to

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
or three at a time this one seems to

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:50.259 
or three at a time this one seems to
have<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.040> little<00:02:49.220> break<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.000> we'll<00:02:50.120> put

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
have a little break in it so we'll put

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.039 
have a little break in it so we'll put
that<00:02:50.450> aside<00:02:53.319> start<00:02:54.319> with<00:02:54.560> another<00:02:55.159> set<00:02:55.639> and<00:02:56.049> at

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
that aside start with another set and at

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.660 
that aside start with another set and at
the<00:02:57.170> beginning<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.829> just<00:02:57.859> have<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.370> get<00:02:58.519> it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the beginning you just have to get it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.179 
the beginning you just have to get it
started<00:02:59.599> so<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.170> you're<00:03:00.560> not<00:03:00.709> worried<00:03:01.159> so

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
started so that you're not worried so

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.099 
started so that you're not worried so
much<00:03:01.519> about<00:03:01.579> how<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.239> starting<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.689> seep<00:03:02.900> up

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
much about how it's starting to seep up

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.000 
much about how it's starting to seep up
just<00:03:03.560> yet<00:03:03.889> but<00:03:04.549> each<00:03:05.150> time<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.689> tie<00:03:06.010> where

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
just yet but each time you tie where

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.770 
just yet but each time you tie where
it's<00:03:07.280> where<00:03:07.790> it's<00:03:07.819> tied<00:03:08.269> is<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.720> to

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
it's where it's tied is going to

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.559 
it's where it's tied is going to
determine<00:03:09.349> how<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.340> whole<00:03:10.519> thing<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.359> going

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
determine how the whole thing is going

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.409 
determine how the whole thing is going
to<00:03:11.659> shape<00:03:11.840> up<00:03:12.079> I'm<00:03:12.319> going<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.829> go<00:03:13.040> wrap<00:03:13.970> around

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
to shape up I'm going to go wrap around

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.390 
to shape up I'm going to go wrap around
and<00:03:14.810> then<00:03:15.260> at<00:03:15.439> this<00:03:15.650> point<00:03:15.950> I'm<00:03:16.189> going<00:03:16.310> to

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and then at this point I'm going to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.869 
and then at this point I'm going to
bring<00:03:16.609> this<00:03:16.849> up<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.419> tie<00:03:18.049> into<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:19.069> because

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
bring this up and tie into this because

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.089 
bring this up and tie into this because
what<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:20.359> will<00:03:20.419> do<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.810> pull<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.439> up<00:03:21.709> as<00:03:21.950> I

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
what this will do is pull this up as I

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.000 
what this will do is pull this up as I
pull<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.909> end<00:03:23.120> over<00:03:23.629> to<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.930> other<00:03:24.049> side<00:03:24.439> now

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
pull the end over to the other side now

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.220 
pull the end over to the other side now
I<00:03:25.040> only<00:03:25.400> tied<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.909> to<00:03:26.090> two<00:03:26.359> of<00:03:26.629> them<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.049> one<00:03:27.200> of

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
I only tied it to two of them so one of

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.869 
I only tied it to two of them so one of
them<00:03:27.409> is<00:03:27.560> going<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:27.889> flop<00:03:28.159> a<00:03:28.190> little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:28.669> which

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
them is going to flop a little bit which

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.670 
them is going to flop a little bit which
is<00:03:29.030> exactly<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.780> desired<00:03:30.139> effect<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.650> I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
is exactly the desired effect that I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.469 
is exactly the desired effect that I
want<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.549> I'm<00:03:31.609> going<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.790> bring<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.090> around<00:03:32.209> a

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:32.479 
want so I'm going to bring it around a

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.509 
want so I'm going to bring it around a
little<00:03:32.659> bit<00:03:32.900> tighter<00:03:33.229> and<00:03:33.620> then<00:03:34.250> bring<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
little bit tighter and then bring it

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.819 
little bit tighter and then bring it
down<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.299> back<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.870> this<00:03:36.079> way<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.560> was<00:03:36.769> able

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
down to the back so this way I was able

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.830 
down to the back so this way I was able
to<00:03:37.069> develop<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.669> little<00:03:37.849> bit<00:03:38.000> more<00:03:38.419> of<00:03:38.659> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
to develop a little bit more of the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.469 
to develop a little bit more of the
depth<00:03:39.109> that<00:03:39.409> is<00:03:40.040> part<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.579> what<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.790> want<00:03:41.150> on<00:03:41.359> the

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
depth that is part of what I want on the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.589 
depth that is part of what I want on the
front<00:03:41.629> side<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.349> their<00:03:42.859> next<00:03:43.310> set<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.239> middle

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
front side and their next set of middle

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.059 
front side and their next set of middle
you<00:03:44.720> know<00:03:44.810> I'll<00:03:45.139> try<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.470> achieve<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.799> little

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
you know I'll try to achieve a little

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.750 
you know I'll try to achieve a little
bit<00:03:46.280> more<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.639> that<00:03:46.879> depth<00:03:47.209> on<00:03:47.449> the<00:03:47.900> back<00:03:48.079> side

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
bit more of that depth on the back side

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.930 
bit more of that depth on the back side
now<00:03:49.760> in<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.419> design<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.430> right<00:03:52.430> here

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
now in the design that I have right here

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.059 
now in the design that I have right here
the<00:03:53.209> flowers<00:03:53.659> are<00:03:53.900> such<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:54.650> they're<00:03:54.829> very

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
the flowers are such that they're very

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.159 
the flowers are such that they're very
short<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:56.000> doesn't<00:03:56.329> require<00:03:56.479> the<00:03:56.930> height

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.169 
short and it doesn't require the height

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.830 
short and it doesn't require the height
that<00:03:57.470> this<00:03:58.060> armature<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.180> setting<00:03:59.479> up<00:03:59.629> to<00:03:59.810> be

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
that this armature is setting up to be

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.219 
that this armature is setting up to be
but<00:04:00.409> this<00:04:00.859> makes<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.970> possible<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.629> if<00:04:03.049> I

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
but this makes it possible that if I

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:07.689 
but this makes it possible that if I
want<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.739> use<00:04:03.919> something<00:04:04.220> much<00:04:04.549> taller<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:06.699> like

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
want to use something much taller I like

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.729 
want to use something much taller I like
the<00:04:07.849> flowers<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.629> want<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.989> use<00:04:09.139> a<00:04:09.169> theorem

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
the flowers if I want to use a theorem

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.099 
the flowers if I want to use a theorem
for<00:04:10.010> instance<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:10.699> much<00:04:10.909> longer<00:04:11.209> what<00:04:12.079> I

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
for instance that is much longer what I

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.939 
for instance that is much longer what I
could<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:13.069> simply<00:04:13.669> still<00:04:14.709> use<00:04:15.709> this

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
could do is simply still use this

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.310 
could do is simply still use this
structure<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.699> that's<00:04:17.419> what<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.930> upper

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
structure and that's what this upper

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.560 
structure and that's what this upper
layers<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:19.010> so<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.459> if<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.729> wanted<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.329> use

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
layers for so that if I wanted to use

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.960 
layers for so that if I wanted to use
something<00:04:21.349> that's<00:04:21.530> much<00:04:21.829> taller<00:04:22.220> this<00:04:22.550> area

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
something that's much taller this area

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.830 
something that's much taller this area
to<00:04:23.659> design<00:04:23.990> into<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.190> I'm<00:04:25.280> gonna<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:25.810> sort<00:04:26.810> of

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
to design into so I'm gonna just sort of

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.310 
to design into so I'm gonna just sort of
trim<00:04:27.110> out<00:04:27.289> these<00:04:27.560> little<00:04:27.949> excess<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.289> sort<00:04:30.289> of

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
trim out these little excess and sort of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.500 
trim out these little excess and sort of
clean<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.860> mechanics<00:04:31.490> up<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.789> little<00:04:31.969> bit<00:04:32.240> by

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
clean that mechanics up a little bit by

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.530 
clean that mechanics up a little bit by
using<00:04:32.539> that<00:04:33.169> silver<00:04:33.590> wire<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.070> makes

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
using that silver wire it makes

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.900 
using that silver wire it makes
cohesive<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.710> containers<00:04:36.700> themselves

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
cohesive to the containers themselves

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.850 
cohesive to the containers themselves
and<00:04:38.940> by<00:04:39.940> cleaning<00:04:40.390> this<00:04:40.660> up<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:41.320> makes<00:04:41.620> it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and by cleaning this up it makes it

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.090 
and by cleaning this up it makes it
mechanically<00:04:42.550> much<00:04:42.850> more<00:04:44.640> neater<00:04:45.640> but<00:04:47.100> I've

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
mechanically much more neater but I've

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.160 
mechanically much more neater but I've
created<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.970> structure<00:04:49.420> that's<00:04:49.840> going<00:04:50.080> to

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
created a structure that's going to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.920 
created a structure that's going to
allow<00:04:50.380> for<00:04:50.410> flow<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.310> different<00:04:52.090> material<00:04:52.840> of

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
allow for flow of different material of

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.890 
allow for flow of different material of
different<00:04:53.230> flowers<00:04:53.580> now<00:04:54.580> just<00:04:55.330> as<00:04:55.480> I<00:04:55.600> said

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
different flowers now just as I said

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.740 
different flowers now just as I said
earlier<00:04:56.320> what<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.160> want<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.520> do<00:04:57.670> now<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.300> just

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
earlier what I want to do now is just

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.660 
earlier what I want to do now is just
sort<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.020> pull<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.410> tug<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.280> can<00:05:00.490> get<00:05:00.610> a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
sort of pull in tug so that I can get a

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.730 
sort of pull in tug so that I can get a
little<00:05:00.940> bit<00:05:01.210> more<00:05:01.390> air<00:05:01.660> in<00:05:01.960> some<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.650> these

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
little bit more air in some of these

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.580 
little bit more air in some of these
move<00:05:03.430> bars<00:05:03.730> these<00:05:04.210> spots<00:05:04.570> like<00:05:04.840> if<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.110> do<00:05:05.170> this

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
move bars these spots like if I do this

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.700 
move bars these spots like if I do this
whoops<00:05:06.040> I<00:05:06.370> slipped<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.030> right<00:05:07.210> out<00:05:07.440> let's<00:05:08.440> go

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
whoops I slipped it right out let's go

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.040 
whoops I slipped it right out let's go
back<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.610> get<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.850> back<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.450> there<00:05:10.630> just<00:05:10.930> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
back and get that back in there just a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.950 
back and get that back in there just a
little<00:05:11.320> bit<00:05:11.910> yeah<00:05:12.910> maybe<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.390> is<00:05:13.600> not<00:05:13.750> the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
little bit yeah maybe this is not the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.080 
little bit yeah maybe this is not the
one<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.230> do<00:05:14.380> although<00:05:14.620> let's<00:05:15.250> let's<00:05:15.640> let's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
one to do although let's let's let's

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.050 
one to do although let's let's let's
pull<00:05:16.480> pull<00:05:16.960> let's<00:05:17.440> do<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:17.860> pull<00:05:18.580> that<00:05:18.730> in<00:05:19.030> a

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
pull pull let's do that pull that in a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.730 
pull pull let's do that pull that in a
little<00:05:19.360> bit<00:05:19.540> and<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:19.990> get<00:05:20.140> a<00:05:20.170> little<00:05:20.440> bit<00:05:20.500> more

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
little bit and you get a little bit more

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.520 
little bit and you get a little bit more
separation<00:05:21.490> there<00:05:21.870> likewise<00:05:22.870> you're<00:05:23.410> going

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
separation there likewise you're going

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.960 
separation there likewise you're going
to<00:05:23.620> get<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.890> same<00:05:24.100> sort<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.430> thing<00:05:24.640> if<00:05:24.850> you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
to get the same sort of thing if you

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.510 
to get the same sort of thing if you
just<00:05:25.000> pull<00:05:25.480> and<00:05:25.780> push<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:27.040> you<00:05:27.100> can<00:05:27.310> get<00:05:27.490> a

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
just pull and push so you can get a

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.310 
just pull and push so you can get a
little<00:05:27.760> bit<00:05:28.000> more<00:05:28.150> variation<00:05:28.810> so<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.050> it's

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
little bit more variation so that it's

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.270 
little bit more variation so that it's
not<00:05:29.530> all<00:05:29.950> bands<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.580> three<00:05:30.910> but<00:05:31.800> some<00:05:32.800> areas

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
not all bands of three but some areas

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.400 
not all bands of three but some areas
you<00:05:33.550> want<00:05:33.760> it<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.240> be<00:05:34.360> band<00:05:34.570> of<00:05:34.810> three<00:05:35.110> because

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
you want it to be band of three because

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.530 
you want it to be band of three because
like<00:05:36.400> if<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.880> take<00:05:38.070> bed<00:05:39.070> rest<00:05:39.100> for<00:05:39.700> instance<00:05:40.270> and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
like if I take bed rest for instance and

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.670 
like if I take bed rest for instance and
I<00:05:40.720> set<00:05:41.350> put<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.580> say<00:05:43.480> right<00:05:43.840> into<00:05:44.350> there

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
I set put it in say right into there

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.280 
I set put it in say right into there
what<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.370> want<00:05:45.730> to<00:05:45.790> be<00:05:45.910> able<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.090> do<00:05:46.270> is<00:05:46.600> from

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
what I want to be able to do is from

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.960 
what I want to be able to do is from
there<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.980> can<00:05:48.160> thread<00:05:48.760> it<00:05:48.970> between<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:50.970> so

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
there I can thread it between here so

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.090 
there I can thread it between here so
that<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.270> holds<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:52.930> place<00:05:53.140> see<00:05:53.830> how<00:05:53.950> it

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
that it holds it in place see how it

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.650 
that it holds it in place see how it
holds<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.460> in<00:05:54.580> place<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:55.000> doesn't<00:05:55.180> go<00:05:55.390> anywhere

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
holds it in place it doesn't go anywhere

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.370 
holds it in place it doesn't go anywhere
and<00:05:56.050> then<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.650> could<00:05:56.890> slip<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.370> in<00:05:57.550> between<00:05:58.380> like

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
and then I could slip it in between like

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.110 
and then I could slip it in between like
these<00:05:59.890> two<00:06:00.280> here<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.860> stays<00:06:03.280> right<00:06:03.820> in

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
these two here so that it stays right in

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.020 
these two here so that it stays right in
that<00:06:04.600> spot<00:06:05.050> where<00:06:05.080> I<00:06:05.350> want<00:06:05.650> it<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.950> be<00:06:06.070> where<00:06:07.000> I

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
that spot where I want it to be where I

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.270 
that spot where I want it to be where I
wanted<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.810> be<00:06:07.990> and<00:06:08.260> so<00:06:08.290> that's<00:06:08.920> really<00:06:09.040> the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
wanted it to be and so that's really the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.100 
wanted it to be and so that's really the
whole<00:06:09.520> purpose<00:06:09.790> of<00:06:10.090> this<00:06:10.330> this<00:06:10.900> whole

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
whole purpose of this this whole

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.620 
whole purpose of this this whole
armature<00:06:11.650> is<00:06:11.950> that<00:06:12.220> it<00:06:12.340> allows<00:06:12.730> the<00:06:12.760> exact

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
armature is that it allows the exact

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.330 
armature is that it allows the exact
placement<00:06:13.930> like<00:06:14.290> here<00:06:14.590> for<00:06:14.620> instance<00:06:14.830> these

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
placement like here for instance these

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.390 
placement like here for instance these
two<00:06:15.700> if<00:06:16.450> I<00:06:16.570> separate<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.170> out<00:06:17.380> and<00:06:17.440> bring<00:06:17.860> it<00:06:17.920> in

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
two if I separate it out and bring it in

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.660 
two if I separate it out and bring it in
see<00:06:19.000> how<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:19.300> sort<00:06:19.660> of<00:06:19.750> just<00:06:20.500> gets<00:06:20.710> stuck<00:06:21.520> in

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
see how it sort of just gets stuck in

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.120 
see how it sort of just gets stuck in
that<00:06:21.790> spot<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.540> then<00:06:23.110> if<00:06:23.260> I<00:06:23.410> bring<00:06:23.740> it<00:06:23.920> around

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
that spot and then if I bring it around

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.270 
that spot and then if I bring it around
and<00:06:26.250> slip<00:06:27.250> it<00:06:27.370> in<00:06:27.490> between<00:06:27.880> these<00:06:28.120> two<00:06:29.100> then<00:06:30.100> it

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
and slip it in between these two then it

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.490 
and slip it in between these two then it
stays<00:06:30.580> in<00:06:30.760> place<00:06:31.030> it<00:06:31.360> just<00:06:31.600> allows<00:06:31.930> for<00:06:32.350> the

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
stays in place it just allows for the

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.160 
stays in place it just allows for the
exact<00:06:32.890> placement<00:06:33.220> of<00:06:33.790> that<00:06:34.360> flow<00:06:34.750> which<00:06:35.020> is

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
exact placement of that flow which is

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.960 
exact placement of that flow which is
very<00:06:35.440> very<00:06:35.680> important<00:06:36.160> because<00:06:36.280> without<00:06:36.670> the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
very very important because without the

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.360 
very very important because without the
armature<00:06:37.510> there's<00:06:38.080> no<00:06:38.290> way<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.800> any<00:06:39.070> of<00:06:39.160> this

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
armature there's no way that any of this

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.280 
armature there's no way that any of this
would<00:06:39.610> stay<00:06:39.850> just<00:06:40.060> exactly<00:06:40.600> why<00:06:40.780> I<00:06:40.810> wanted<00:06:41.140> to

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
would stay just exactly why I wanted to

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.590 
would stay just exactly why I wanted to
go<00:06:41.470> and<00:06:42.160> so<00:06:42.400> that's<00:06:42.610> the<00:06:42.790> purpose<00:06:42.970> of<00:06:43.419> this

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
go and so that's the purpose of this

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.700 
go and so that's the purpose of this
whole<00:06:43.900> exercise<00:06:44.710> this<00:06:45.280> whole

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
whole exercise this whole

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.760 
whole exercise this whole
mechanic<00:06:46.670> is<00:06:46.880> that<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.540> gives<00:06:48.080> you<00:06:48.230> the<00:06:48.260> exact

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
mechanic is that it gives you the exact

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.000 
mechanic is that it gives you the exact
placement<00:06:49.070> of<00:06:49.550> what<00:06:50.270> you<00:06:51.080> want<00:06:51.500> your<00:06:51.590> material

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
placement of what you want your material

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.890 
placement of what you want your material
to<00:06:52.160> do<00:06:52.310> so<00:06:52.580> this<00:06:52.730> is<00:06:52.790> kind<00:06:53.240> of<00:06:53.330> what<00:06:53.480> it's<00:06:53.630> for

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
to do so this is kind of what it's for

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.400 
to do so this is kind of what it's for
now<00:06:54.700> here's<00:06:55.700> a<00:06:55.730> case<00:06:56.000> in<00:06:56.210> point<00:06:56.240> I<00:06:56.780> think<00:06:57.200> he

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
now here's a case in point I think he

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.080 
now here's a case in point I think he
went<00:06:57.620> on<00:06:57.710> the<00:06:57.800> other<00:06:57.920> episode<00:06:58.430> I<00:06:58.460> showed<00:06:58.610> how

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
went on the other episode I showed how

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.600 
went on the other episode I showed how
you<00:06:59.150> could<00:06:59.560> bring<00:07:00.560> the<00:07:00.740> stems<00:07:01.040> up<00:07:01.280> a<00:07:01.400> little

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
you could bring the stems up a little

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.180 
you could bring the stems up a little
bit<00:07:01.820> in<00:07:02.060> this<00:07:02.270> case<00:07:02.540> if<00:07:02.720> I<00:07:02.900> want<00:07:03.140> this<00:07:03.590> to<00:07:04.160> be

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
bit in this case if I want this to be

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.700 
bit in this case if I want this to be
much<00:07:04.490> taller<00:07:04.850> in<00:07:05.360> this<00:07:05.630> case<00:07:05.870> I<00:07:06.050> used<00:07:06.290> it<00:07:06.530> as

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
much taller in this case I used it as

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.770 
much taller in this case I used it as
they<00:07:07.010> came<00:07:07.280> the<00:07:07.640> short<00:07:07.880> stem<00:07:08.180> and<00:07:08.390> tucked<00:07:08.630> it

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 
they came the short stem and tucked it

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.930 
they came the short stem and tucked it
in<00:07:08.930> there<00:07:09.140> which<00:07:09.350> is<00:07:09.530> fine<00:07:09.770> but<00:07:10.310> if<00:07:10.460> I<00:07:10.610> wanted

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
in there which is fine but if I wanted

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.270 
in there which is fine but if I wanted
this<00:07:11.120> to<00:07:11.300> be<00:07:11.390> taller<00:07:11.720> I<00:07:12.110> could<00:07:12.590> simply<00:07:13.010> fill

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
this to be taller I could simply fill

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.080 
this to be taller I could simply fill
this<00:07:13.490> with<00:07:13.730> water<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.590> then<00:07:15.590> insert<00:07:16.190> this<00:07:16.490> cut

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
this with water and then insert this cut

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.440 
this with water and then insert this cut
Indian<00:07:17.720> and<00:07:18.020> tuck<00:07:18.890> it<00:07:19.130> right<00:07:19.280> down<00:07:19.850> actually

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.450 
Indian and tuck it right down actually

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.750 
Indian and tuck it right down actually
you<00:07:20.540> want<00:07:20.750> this<00:07:20.930> to<00:07:21.140> be<00:07:21.290> so<00:07:21.590> that<00:07:21.830> let's<00:07:22.520> just

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
you want this to be so that let's just

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.190 
you want this to be so that let's just
sort<00:07:23.090> of<00:07:23.120> puncture<00:07:23.540> this<00:07:23.660> through<00:07:23.960> so<00:07:24.110> it

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.200 
sort of puncture this through so it

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.980 
sort of puncture this through so it
could<00:07:24.380> be<00:07:24.410> a<00:07:24.920> little<00:07:25.220> bit<00:07:25.340> longer<00:07:25.610> and<00:07:26.060> just

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
could be a little bit longer and just

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.660 
could be a little bit longer and just
puncture<00:07:27.470> it<00:07:27.560> all<00:07:27.770> the<00:07:27.890> way<00:07:27.980> down<00:07:28.160> so<00:07:28.400> that<00:07:28.490> it

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.670 
puncture it all the way down so that it

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.610 
puncture it all the way down so that it
doesn't<00:07:29.450> just<00:07:29.510> start<00:07:30.020> in<00:07:30.110> the<00:07:30.230> middle<00:07:30.470> of<00:07:30.530> the

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
doesn't just start in the middle of the

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.460 
doesn't just start in the middle of the
stem<00:07:30.890> but<00:07:31.130> do<00:07:31.310> this<00:07:31.580> and<00:07:31.880> then<00:07:32.510> you'd<00:07:33.110> seen<00:07:33.350> the

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
stem but do this and then you'd seen the

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.890 
stem but do this and then you'd seen the
water<00:07:33.650> tube<00:07:34.070> and<00:07:34.490> so<00:07:35.180> I'm<00:07:35.300> going<00:07:35.540> to<00:07:35.600> just<00:07:35.750> sort

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 
water tube and so I'm going to just sort

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.230 
water tube and so I'm going to just sort
of<00:07:36.050> design<00:07:36.380> into<00:07:36.830> this<00:07:36.950> right<00:07:37.190> here<00:07:37.580> so<00:07:38.210> that

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
of design into this right here so that

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.450 
of design into this right here so that
you<00:07:38.480> could<00:07:38.660> have<00:07:38.990> stems<00:07:39.710> that<00:07:39.890> are<00:07:40.010> much<00:07:40.250> much

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460 
you could have stems that are much much

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.080 
you could have stems that are much much
taller<00:07:40.790> and<00:07:41.180> so<00:07:42.080> this<00:07:42.290> way<00:07:42.530> you<00:07:42.590> can<00:07:43.010> have

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.090 
taller and so this way you can have

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.910 
taller and so this way you can have
extender<00:07:44.090> stem<00:07:44.360> and<00:07:44.660> get<00:07:44.930> designed<00:07:45.710> much

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:45.920 
extender stem and get designed much

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.490 
extender stem and get designed much
higher<00:07:46.280> and<00:07:46.610> this<00:07:47.210> does<00:07:47.480> have<00:07:47.750> a<00:07:47.960> water<00:07:48.200> source

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500 
higher and this does have a water source

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.410 
higher and this does have a water source
so<00:07:48.590> this<00:07:49.070> is<00:07:49.310> just<00:07:49.580> one<00:07:49.760> of<00:07:49.850> the<00:07:49.940> methods<00:07:50.330> that

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.420 
so this is just one of the methods that

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.860 
so this is just one of the methods that
we<00:07:50.630> use<00:07:50.660> to<00:07:51.170> create<00:07:51.710> tall<00:07:52.370> or<00:07:52.700> short<00:07:53.150> with<00:07:53.660> this

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870 
we use to create tall or short with this

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.650 
we use to create tall or short with this
particular<00:07:54.140> flower
