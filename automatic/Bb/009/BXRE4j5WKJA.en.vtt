00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:04.150
 It is not easy to find a woman among the truckers 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.950
 but what is easy is to find confusion among the transportitas 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.630
 Europeans because of the differences of criteria that there are according to 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.689
 country or in another union 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.980
 as for example the issue of sanctions 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.720
 unlike the amount the difference in the criteria there is to the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.199
 time to understand road safety is something that baffles many 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.550
 workers 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.119
 discrepancies in criteria difference in amount that are intended now 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.529
 delimit 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.730
 according to a new regulation that is studying the European Union ue 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.890
 the disparity of criteria in a matter as specific as that of fines for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.670
 hundred 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.940
 had a great sense of insecurity in a collective that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.560
 faces his son 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.860
 many times 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.380
 due to ignorance of the rules in which countries of the lawn union 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.520
 Truck professionals do not understand how there are no rules of the game 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.600
 the same for everyone 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.710
 the information we do not want any 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.220
 and coordination 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.020
 it was far less 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.100
 is that we do not understand 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.770
 if we belong the whole European community 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.760
 Why is there such a tremendous scale of difference with the same sanction? 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.300
 we understand 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.940
 nor do we have anyone who did not explain it 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 this is an issue where there seems to be widespread agreement 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.120
 although the truly complex will be to find the legislative framework and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.420
 traffic to reduce the differences in each case 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.660
 set maximum caps 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.310
 and catalog every month 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.380
 in this way think guild 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.710
 it would end with a situation of insecurity and bewilderment 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.010
 they are neither so gross nor the amount of baby bullets 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.580
 nor the problem that is going to have for the fine then we go brutally 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.160
 broken does not know what can happen 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.400
 the working day of the autonomous transporters is another of the great 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.760
 debates that have arisen from both the euro chamber and the recipient 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.580
 the agreement seems more difficult 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.560
 there are two positions clearly 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.600
 those who support that the day of the self-employed be regulated equally 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.450
 way that of the employees 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.899
 and those who maintain that an autonomous can not be regulated in the same way 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 work schedules in front of the truck 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.179
 we must add those of the management 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.319
 an autonomous even if it's a lady 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 there has to be a management that is not going to be salaried 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.239
 in pinto one should not contemplate the same day why because it is that 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.739
 really when he does not do it was an autonomous pioneer who is going to do it 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.069
 before the argument of those who defend the same regulation for reasons of 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.359
 Occupational Health &amp; Safety 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.239
 as they reason that road safety and the health of drivers 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.189
 is already guaranteed through the regulation on times of 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.049
 driving and rest whose application is identical for all drivers 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:46.639
 YÃ©sica is a young woman she was also 25 years old who has fit into the guild with 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.639
 a great 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.819
 despite his youth and here he does not realize great routes he understands that it is not easy 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.899
 to limit their schedules in this collective we arrived where this race 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.949
 and the same thing we have for charity that is to see 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.169
 Four. Five% 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.109
 we are waiting 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.659
 schedule we can not 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.430
 an east sector of the transport that studies and demands to incorporate norms that 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.680
 eliminate barriers between the countries of the union 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.769
 with the same naturalness for example 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.569
 with which women have joined this profession 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.759
 mostly of men
