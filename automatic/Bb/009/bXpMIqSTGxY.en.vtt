00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.389
 sting good since we are already in the classroom 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.889
 kitchen of the akelarre restaurant here 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.129
 with pedro subijana 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.289
 Now well, I have a lot of salt 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.269
 many weeks there are also there 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 criminals eave the life of good because 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.220
 let's prepare the place and Murcia 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.089
 of the harmful salt of the village tomorrow 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 that is it cleared help ordered nothing 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:34.200
 more than is to remember and I pretty much 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.079
 the area of ​​how is we going to prepare some 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.539
 anchovies but a hundred of this dish 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.030
 we started doing the best with salt 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.910
 añana because as a consequence of my 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.949
 collaboration with the foundation we are going to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 speak from within the collaboration 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.940
 from now on a foundation and with or without 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 Profit remains high on your part 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 as it will be foundation and script and I knew 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.449
 the existence I if these outputs I do 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.219
 I am but I came has searched for me 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 they asked to see if to collaborate and so 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.510
 support and it was that we seek to do 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.510
 together with our team with borja and with 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 the watering that are in this classroom 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.730
 this is the post of more development 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.610
 we are looking for that because to 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:19.250
 me are news that had abandoned 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 for me it's an old new news for 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.900
 all entries always some 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.270
 makes the salt to season to make a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.010
 crust alba we think that by 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.610
 example with you 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.610
 without anchovies 4 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 let's make a dish with anchovies and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.440
 then we did this this is brought out at 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 start like this there are not a few sheets of 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.990
 tomato and then we have the diretes of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:53.520
 fact that we put them in the addicts 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.979
 juntitos in the on top of the tomato and that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 we are going to cook them through the heat 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.090
 that produces salt 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 that by the way you said it was that it was 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.640
 tremendously bad for the dynamics in 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 the salt that is loaded thanks because they go 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.800
 to die in the distance line then 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.410
 We put a good stable four 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.770
 ingredients for example a few shoots of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770
 tender garlic 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.880
 the Tajiks also from the chives 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.910
 we all have flowers in the garden 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.500
 for flowers 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.730
 if you want in total 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.730
 perfectly onion 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.800
 then we put these ingredients 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.170
 we also put a few piparras 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.300
 because this is what we do today 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.980
 buying in the market for a ordizia 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.880
 plants and therefore tells me this is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.120
 used in the market making a 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 little bit of buying over there and watching 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.490
 as the caveats then as not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.560
 we have fresh natural private 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.630
 we put our of them in 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.880
 vinegar with ibarra vinegar but 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.980
 because it gives a touch to watch and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.739
 we also see how then 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.390
 this we cook it in front of the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.750
 commensal and this goes well up to the table and 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.290
 the waiter takes an hour is once 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.879
 with a wet cloth that transmits and a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.830
 true but to the same guy so that 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.690
 prevent the assault that not at all 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.060
 You raise because the only thing you are going to do is 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 let him bleed in contact with or not 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.019
 in this first phase of the sheet that is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.019
 so by cardenas 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.329
 it is super hot it will be collected you know 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.370
 that I am only there are chargers and 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.250
 then at the beginning it comes with 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.379
 then this will do is 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.579
 put together with a skewer of 20 a little 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.319
 of oil from behind so you do not 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.720
 stick the anchovy then to the bathroom and then 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.709
 put in front of the diner 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.470
 we put the anchovies on the covers 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.959
 completely because with this one do nothing 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.040
 of salt more heat salt plus heat what 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.580
 we publish 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.070
 and we put it with the iphone and a time 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:25.350
 between 3 and 4 minutes we do this 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:28.720
 also with squid in 3 or 4 years 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.610
 while we are explaining we are 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 we hope explaining with that the rest 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.840
 what are we going to do and vice explaining 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.550
 morning salt is activated 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.800
 the many studies are the 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.860
 stalactites that occur in 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.840
 channels where the next series goes 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.210
 it's a bit like a fifth essence 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 designated earthquakes because inclusion we will do 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.840
 from the tear of salt a tear of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.690
 blood of more or less then 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.230
 here we have an oil that we approach 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.630
 with anchovies betray base connection 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.940
 please is the blue then that with a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.040
 little bit and then when we do this to you 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
 rail we will make a little bit of salt 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.520
 who will be alone have no garden and 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.090
 we will put a little bit of this oil to 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.920
 give it with the 5 in the heat that this is 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.870
 enough for it to be done a 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.490
 cooking you'll see what you're going to taste is the 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.310
 which makes an option that is almost not 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.840
 cooking but that is hot and a little 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.180
 it has begun to cook more and be 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.379
 bleached 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.110
 we put this to the diner in the 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.110
 local table and if it is to distribute 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.199
 in a state more curiosity about the 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.059
 tourism with a lot of flavor but when 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.619
 we do summer with young children 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.809
 of those blue or one by one water 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:45.990
 synthesis then we do the same with 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.990
 those Chinese if we get in 2020 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:54.180
 because it has to be a product that 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.180
 almost still dying 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:05.139
 your helpers at the table 600 this 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.990
 corresponds to a philosophy that we 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.259
 We have many years we took 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:14.439
 bent on being the waiter the people 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.209
 of the room the 1,003 star in a 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.800
 little more what is achieved the activity does not 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.479
 it's so much of the dining room because 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.879
 chefs we have eaten or have 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.740
 left for many years and then 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.480
 there are very few people who want to follow the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.650
 world of the rooms very beautiful 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.240
 the good several dishes in which 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.530
 the people in the room intervene directly 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.120
 and the importance that we go now does not 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.740
 we have a mixed season material 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.050
 that is blue and another that are here I 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.830
 Knowing the good agriculture and improve 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.870
 even more like this we started it 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.340
 do in the other in the season 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.020
 summer with squid and some of that 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.310
 carries all the ingredients of what 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.770
 is the tomato the lover of good 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.870
 relationship that we have in the normal garden 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.570
 now it is not welcome but now with the 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.110
 work of the hotel we raise a farm of 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.450
 the turn 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.290
 the aromatic herbs on which 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.290
 we have a neighbor 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.020
 cream 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.139
 this is going in a moment 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:41.370
 we get up and then let's give it 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.710
 and then 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:04.379
 of the width 

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.379
 and this is going
