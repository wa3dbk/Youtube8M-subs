00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
take a look at a little look around

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
take a look at a little look around
because<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> front<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> packaging<00:00:46.559> is

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because the front of the packaging is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.529 
because the front of the packaging is
very<00:00:46.770> basic<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> back<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.420> basically

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
very basic but the back it basically

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.930 
very basic but the back it basically
says<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> case<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.379> made<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
says that the case is made out of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
says that the case is made out of
polycarbonate<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.300> silicon<00:00:52.070> it<00:00:53.070> basically

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
polycarbonate and silicon it basically

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.610 
polycarbonate and silicon it basically
tells<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> steps<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> install<00:00:55.110> install

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
tells you the steps to install install

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
tells you the steps to install install
the<00:00:55.739> silicone<00:00:55.920> case<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.120> ago<00:00:57.420> goes

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the silicone case of which ago goes

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
the silicone case of which ago goes
around<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> iphone<00:00:58.469> first<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> then

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
around the iphone first of all and then

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
around the iphone first of all and then
the<00:01:00.329> poly<00:01:00.780> carbonate<00:01:01.170> case<00:01:01.530> snaps<00:01:01.949> onto<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the poly carbonate case snaps onto the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
the poly carbonate case snaps onto the
back<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:03.510> order<00:01:04.049> charge<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> port<00:01:04.650> headphone

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
back the order charge and port headphone

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.719 
back the order charge and port headphone
port<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.729> still<00:01:06.030> exposed<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.750> then

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
port on that are still exposed and then

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.910 
port on that are still exposed and then
basically<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> two-part<00:01:09.810> case<00:01:10.049> or

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
basically it's like a two-part case or

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.320 
basically it's like a two-part case or
really<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> cases<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
really like these kind of cases of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
really like these kind of cases of
something<00:01:12.780> different<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> something

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
something different and it's something

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
something different and it's something
differently<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.100> everyone<00:01:14.400> has<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.909> was

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the cases actually protected in another

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
the cases actually protected in another
plastic<00:01:58.340> sleeve<00:01:59.340> okay<00:01:59.850> step<00:02:00.090> inside<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
plastic sleeve okay step inside there is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.780 
plastic sleeve okay step inside there is
an<00:02:01.020> insert<00:02:01.469> cardboard<00:02:01.920> insert<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> keep<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
case protected and then the case comes

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
case protected and then the case comes
in<00:02:07.049> two<00:02:07.290> parts<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:07.890> I'm<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.220> now

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
in two parts so what I'm going to do now

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.919 
in two parts so what I'm going to do now
guys<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.970> I'm<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> try<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
guys is I'm actually going to try and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.869 
guys is I'm actually going to try and
separate<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.739> two<00:02:10.920> parts<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> show<00:02:11.849> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
separate the two parts just to show you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.090 
separate the two parts just to show you
guys<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> mean<00:02:12.810> by<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> two-part<00:02:13.590> case

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
guys what I mean by a two-part case

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.950 
guys what I mean by a two-part case
I<00:02:14.130> think<00:02:14.700> they're<00:02:14.880> great<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:17.690> out<00:02:18.690> with<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
I think they're great so out with the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.650 
I think they're great so out with the
polycarbonate<00:02:19.920> comes<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.700> silicone<00:02:21.210> part<00:02:21.540> of

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
polycarbonate comes the silicone part of

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.170 
polycarbonate comes the silicone part of
the<00:02:21.750> case<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.920> has<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> cardboard<00:02:23.460> insert<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
the case it has a cardboard insert and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.790 
the case it has a cardboard insert and
I'll<00:02:24.270> take<00:02:24.420> mouth<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:24.990> basically<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.410> silicone

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
I'll take mouth so basically a silicone

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.010 
I'll take mouth so basically a silicone
case<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.130> really<00:02:26.310> flimsy<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.630> gives<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
case is really flimsy and this gives the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
case is really flimsy and this gives the
iphone<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.770> protective<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.490> rubberized

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
iphone the protective and rubberized

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.000 
iphone the protective and rubberized
feel<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.870> drop<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.710> that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
feel so that if you drop it is that

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.680 
feel so that if you drop it is that
basically<00:02:32.250> shock<00:02:32.640> resistant<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.360> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
basically shock resistant because of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.130 
basically shock resistant because of
this<00:02:33.810> plastic<00:02:34.380> case<00:02:35.030> basically<00:02:36.030> you've<00:02:36.900> gotta

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
this plastic case basically you've gotta

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
this plastic case basically you've gotta
pour<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.590> bottom<00:02:37.890> are<00:02:38.100> protected<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:38.940> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
pour the bottom are protected but it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
pour the bottom are protected but it
slides<00:02:39.420> down<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.930> let<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.350> into<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> charging

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
slides down to let you into the charging

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.820 
slides down to let you into the charging
port<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.020> same<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.440> top<00:02:43.650> for

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
port and it's the same at the top for

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.320 
port and it's the same at the top for
the<00:02:43.860> headphone<00:02:44.220> port<00:02:44.520> actually<00:02:44.880> comes<00:02:45.150> away

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
the headphone port actually comes away

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.840 
the headphone port actually comes away
you<00:02:45.780> probably<00:02:46.050> see<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.530> there<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.670> is

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
you probably see that there and then is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.940 
you probably see that there and then is
like<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> raised<00:02:48.660> button<00:02:49.140> for<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.350> home<00:02:49.530> screen

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
like a raised button for the home screen

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.130 
like a raised button for the home screen
to<00:02:50.220> probably<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.840> was

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
to probably see that as well so that was

layer cases arm and this is why i've
said<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.090> case<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.600> fantastic<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.380> I've

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
said this case is fantastic because I've

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.250 
said this case is fantastic because I've
read<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.100> lot<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.370> reviews<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.900> actual

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
read a lot of reviews on it the actual

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.470 
read a lot of reviews on it the actual
styling<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> case<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.670> smooth<00:03:33.180> but

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
styling of the case is very smooth but

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.790 
styling of the case is very smooth but
there's<00:03:33.630> no<00:03:33.750> pattern<00:03:34.020> on<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.380> at<00:03:34.440> all<00:03:34.620> so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
there's no pattern on it at all so

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.850 
there's no pattern on it at all so
you're<00:03:34.920> basically<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.750> black<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:37.050> black<00:03:37.350> playing

you're basically a black a black playing

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.820 
you're basically a black a black playing
case<00:03:38.160> there's<00:03:38.490> no<00:03:38.610> design<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.150> at<00:03:39.330> all<00:03:39.830> the

case there's no design on it at all the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190 
case there's no design on it at all the
cameras<00:03:41.250> visible<00:03:41.640> there<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.930> what<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.110> will

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
cameras visible there but what I will

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 
cameras visible there but what I will

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
raised part of plastic and what this bit

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.550 
raised part of plastic and what this bit
of<00:03:57.090> plastic<00:03:57.240> does<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.840> see<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.110> there<00:03:58.350> it

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
of plastic does you can see it there it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.800 
of plastic does you can see it there it
goes<00:03:59.280> into<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> dock<00:04:00.000> connector<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.540> keep<00:04:00.690> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
goes into the dock connector to keep it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
headphone jack and on it there's a bit

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.200 
headphone jack and on it there's a bit
of<00:04:07.680> braised<00:04:08.070> plastic<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.790> can<00:04:08.910> see<00:04:09.030> there

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
of braised plastic you can see there

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.520 
of braised plastic you can see there
there<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.540> actually<00:04:09.900> goes<00:04:10.110> into<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
there so actually goes into the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.170 
there so actually goes into the
headphone<00:04:10.680> jack<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.220> keep<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.580> secure<00:04:11.970> from

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
headphone jack to keep it secure from

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.680 
headphone jack to keep it secure from
dust<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.710> great<00:04:13.950> case<00:04:14.430> from<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:15.210> case

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
dust so this is a great case from a case

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.260 
dust so this is a great case from a case
I<00:04:16.500> am<00:04:17.310> actually<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.730> use<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.030> case

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
I am actually going to use this case

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.390 
I am actually going to use this case
