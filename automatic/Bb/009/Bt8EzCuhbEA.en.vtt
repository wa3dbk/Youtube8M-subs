00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.020
 chess game on this occasion os 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.710
 I present a game that played the great 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.040
 Player Alexander Alyoshin or Alekhine 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 whatever you want to call it and it was in a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.090
 simultaneous in palma de mallorca in the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.910
 year 1935 and it is a is a trap or trap 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.400
 as you want to call it in what will be in 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.869
 the expensive kann defense or the sample to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.380
 continuation is worth the violin begins with 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.100
 4 c 6 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.579
 his rival to cc6 for 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.359
 to advance the pawn of 4 and enter the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.359
 expensive defense kann 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.649
 of four out of five 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.649
 three horses of four 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.610
 cavallo for 4x4 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.980
 and here the black play horse 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 of 7 is idea to develop the horse 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:15.990
 is why because the idea of ​​the black 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 would play horse efe 6 but of course 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.400
 they do not want to be doubled a pawn 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.900
 Well, the first thing that Black does 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.900
 develop the horse 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 has flown again 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.610
 then develops on the horse of 7 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.910
 for 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.530
 when they remove the horse 6, then, no 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:53.100
 the pawns are doubled and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.990
 to take up with the horse is worth the idea 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.869
 what this horse gets first is that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.280
 ok but the plant is here can do 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.890
 the play give me 2 that tends a trap or 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.770
 trap 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.520
 the first one who made it invented it 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.740
 was the great alexander alyoshin and 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.040
 it's a play that is a mistake in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.380
 principle because because it develops the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 lady here and you're plugging 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.240
 moving your lady wasting time 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 the same time you are putting the bishop that 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.190
 do not let it out okay but in a 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.970
 starting as can be simultaneous 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.270
 this great champion or a quick game 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.760
 it may be worth at a given moment already 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.730
 I say it's a bad move, but it's worth it 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.019
 all this way the great combiner that was the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 joy and then he made it invented it go and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.530
 here blacks can continue 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.150
 of the blacks already studied right now 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.370
 it is this valley c6 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.730
 s 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.340
 it's worth playing they are totally playable 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.170
 and good and the black ones are better but 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.720
 when this game was played for the first time 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 Once the player who was driving the black 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.860
 who made horse efe 6 for when 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.860
 take 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.870
 horse for horse then take back from 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.650
 horse and look good but here goes into 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.790
 I play the trap the trap that I had in 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.629
 alekhine mind is worth and it is simply and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.790
 simply and great and spectacular 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:41.230
 Played six-checkmate horse 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:44.890
 now we see why the lady moved 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.730
 and two is worth it because the pawn is nailed and 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.700
 when making the jump, the worst can not move 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.390
 and the king has been locked up by all 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.590
 his pieces here in a jail from which 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.850
 can not leave and is checkmate because 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.970
 he liked 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.270
 this beautiful trap 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.950
 the movement is not theoretically 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.980
 right you can do line favorites and 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.940
 see you in the next vale friends 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.940
 see you later
