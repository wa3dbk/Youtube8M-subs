 supercross this Ecuadorian with more than 7 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.610
 years as a professional in this sport 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.099

 as clear initial many thanks 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.170

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.629
 Ecuador my family had motorcycles only 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 to walk practically and some friends 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.999
 they invited us to the track to meet and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.249
 everything and from there I started the motocross 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:56.339
 for me it was a hobby it was not it was not so much 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.579
 seriously more I liked to play soccer and 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.710
 all that and from there I started my dad saw 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.870
 something in me and we go out into the streets 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.360
 competences of Latin America we have 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.760
 world and they bring us in austria in spain 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.950
 and from there it started it all started 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.600
 we came from the USA and from there it comes to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.100
 begin to realize my dream 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 Martin to know a little more 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 of this discipline 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 and supercross what do you do 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 what are the biggest differences good 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.540
 the super crochet I made in a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.440
 stadium is the people is one more track 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 compressed 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.050
 it is made for what 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 that can put you in a stadium a 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.010
 baseball stadium a football stadium 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 and people go crazy feels 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.300
 just one sits down to see is how 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.710
 go to have a monster trucks move all 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 it's like going to see a football match 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.910
 with respect to a show of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 motocross is a more open track is 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.610
 more natural is not so compressed there are 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.410
 natural jumps is not no 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.830
 it is not all armed as it is in the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.830
 supercross 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 known as the friendliest competitor 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.340
 in the arena of the supercross martín we 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.220
 commented that pursuing the dream of being 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 champion has not been easy as I eat 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 your family 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.750
 your decision to say good look 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.430
 you know I want to do this seriously 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.030
 I want to be a supercross professional 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.220
 I'm going to the USA what was the reaction of 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.640
 they 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.520
 my mom not not so happy or nobody 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.410
 we have my brothers 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.720
 and it was too hard for me to leave all 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.030
 the family there but they understand that 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.730
 this is my dream is what I want 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.650
 to perform is difficult one there is to be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.350
 sacrifice sometimes to make a 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.570
 I dream of jumping more than 70 feet 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.910
 distance and pirouettes in the air calls 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.710
 triple the supercross is a show 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.230
 unequaled for fans of the 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.610
 adrenaline which is what you like most about 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.640
 make super cross 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 just being in the stadium to go 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.120
 all they go and just screaming and 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.610
 being there on emotion is what most 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.160
 I like it in 2012, Martin occupied the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.110
 eighth place in the world supercross and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.380
 although it is said easy since in these 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.380
 maneuvers 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.100
 this year Martin will compete in more than eight 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.860
 national supercross races for 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.080
 surpass that number we are sure of 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.890
 that we will see much more of this talented 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.890
 Ecuadorian
