and I just want to give you a quick
tutorial<00:00:03.540> I've<00:00:04.440> been<00:00:04.620> getting<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.859> lot<00:00:04.890> of

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
tutorial I've been getting a lot of

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.980 
tutorial I've been getting a lot of
questions<00:00:05.460> on<00:00:05.640> trimming<00:00:06.029> I'll<00:00:06.660> show<00:00:06.870> you

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
questions on trimming I'll show you

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.600 
questions on trimming I'll show you
three<00:00:07.140> different<00:00:07.200> kinds<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.710> controls<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
three different kinds of controls and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.120 
three different kinds of controls and
how<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> properly<00:00:09.570> trim<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.260> quadcopter<00:00:10.559> or

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
how to properly trim your quadcopter or

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.339 
how to properly trim your quadcopter or
helicopter<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.240> lot<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> these<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:13.049> carry

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
helicopter and a lot of these will carry

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.350 
helicopter and a lot of these will carry
on<00:00:13.500> over<00:00:13.710> into<00:00:13.980> airplanes<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:14.700> well<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.210> if

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
on over into airplanes as well so if

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
on over into airplanes as well so if
you're<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> beginner<00:00:15.809> flier<00:00:16.049> pay<00:00:16.920> attention

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
you're a beginner flier pay attention

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.650 
you're a beginner flier pay attention
because<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.029> important<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> get

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
because this is really important to get

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.510 
because this is really important to get
good<00:00:19.020> flight<00:00:19.289> performance<00:00:19.619> out<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> your

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
good flight performance out of your

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.490 
good flight performance out of your
aircraft<00:00:20.869> okay<00:00:21.869> some<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> things<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
aircraft okay some of the things that

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980 
aircraft okay some of the things that
will<00:00:22.680> cause<00:00:22.859> quad<00:00:23.369> copters<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.960> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
will cause quad copters to be out of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
will cause quad copters to be out of
trim<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.279> sometimes<00:00:26.460> when<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
trim is you know sometimes when you

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.390 
trim is you know sometimes when you
crash<00:00:27.119> these<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.599> blades<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:28.050> bent<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
crash these the blades get bent so you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.279 
crash these the blades get bent so you
know<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.849> blade<00:00:30.119> might<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.750> performing

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
know one blade might not be performing

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.720 
know one blade might not be performing
as<00:00:31.410> well<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.830> other<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.309> might<00:00:32.550> need

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
as well as the other so you might need

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.270 
as well as the other so you might need
to<00:00:32.790> allow<00:00:33.360> some<00:00:33.570> trim<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.590> doesn't<00:00:34.920> drift

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to allow some trim so it doesn't drift

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.299 
to allow some trim so it doesn't drift
off<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.880> side<00:00:36.440> other<00:00:37.440> things<00:00:37.800> would<00:00:38.070> be

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
off to the side other things would be

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.850 
off to the side other things would be
like<00:00:38.719> stronger<00:00:39.719> motors<00:00:40.079> maybe<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.590> motor

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
like stronger motors maybe one motor

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
like stronger motors maybe one motor
slightly<00:00:41.309> stronger<00:00:41.700> than<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> other<00:00:42.090> ones<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
slightly stronger than the other ones or

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
slightly stronger than the other ones or
one<00:00:42.780> might<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.170> weaker<00:00:43.530> than<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:43.829> ones

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
one might be weaker than the other ones

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.940 
one might be weaker than the other ones
um<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.510> trim<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.770> back

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
um then you can trim and get that back

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.860 
um then you can trim and get that back
in<00:00:47.129> balance

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
in balance

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
in balance
one<00:00:48.870> other<00:00:48.960> thing<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.379> weight<00:00:49.680> distribution

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
one other thing is weight distribution

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
one other thing is weight distribution
this<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.420> small<00:00:51.660> quad<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.230> you're

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this is a really small quad so you're

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
this is a really small quad so you're
not<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.829> attaching<00:00:53.430> anything<00:00:53.940> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
not going to be attaching anything to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
not going to be attaching anything to
this<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> larger<00:00:55.649> quad

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this one but if you have a larger quad

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.910 
this one but if you have a larger quad
you're<00:00:56.070> putting<00:00:56.370> cameras<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.270> antennas

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
you're putting cameras on or antennas

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.680 
you're putting cameras on or antennas
sometimes<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.190> weight<00:00:59.789> distribution<00:01:00.059> will

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sometimes the weight distribution will

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
sometimes the weight distribution will
be<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> trim<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> back

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
be off and you can trim to get it back

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
be off and you can trim to get it back
in<00:01:02.820> balance<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.660> I'll<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> how<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> do

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
in balance and I'll show you how to do

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
in balance and I'll show you how to do
that<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> cheerson<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that so for the cheerson this one I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
that so for the cheerson this one I
reviewed<00:01:07.740> I'll<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> link<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> video

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
reviewed I'll put a link to the video

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
reviewed I'll put a link to the video
over<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.320> does<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.590> trim<00:01:11.159> tabs

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
over here this one does have trim tabs

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
over here this one does have trim tabs
they're<00:01:11.850> very<00:01:12.030> tiny<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.900> still<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.439> work

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
they're very tiny but they still do work

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.340 
they're very tiny but they still do work
so<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.240> do<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.140> first

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so the way I like to do it is you first

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.070 
so the way I like to do it is you first
want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> quadcopter<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:18.080> hovering

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
want to get the quadcopter up hovering

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
want to get the quadcopter up hovering
off<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> ground<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.759> maybe<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
off the ground just a you know maybe a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.030 
off the ground just a you know maybe a
couple<00:01:21.180> feet<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.500> important

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
couple feet and that's very important

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440 
couple feet and that's very important
when<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.250> trimming<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.670> helicopter<00:01:24.180> or

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
when you're trimming your helicopter or

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
when you're trimming your helicopter or
quadcopter<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> close<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> objects

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
quadcopter not to do it close to objects

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
quadcopter not to do it close to objects
like<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> couch<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> wall<00:01:28.530> because<00:01:29.130> that's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
like a couch or a wall because that's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
like a couch or a wall because that's
gonna<00:01:29.520> create<00:01:29.850> turbulence<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.200> not

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
gonna create turbulence and it's not

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.719 
gonna create turbulence and it's not
going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> you're<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.579> an

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going to be you're not going to get an

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.149 
going to be you're not going to get an
accurate<00:01:32.909> trim<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.380> make<00:01:34.560> sure<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:35.009> in

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
accurate trim so make sure it's out in

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.700 
accurate trim so make sure it's out in
the<00:01:35.220> open<00:01:35.280> away<00:01:36.150> from<00:01:36.360> any<00:01:36.570> large<00:01:36.810> objects<00:01:39.710> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the open away from any large objects so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
the open away from any large objects so
now<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.189> your<00:01:41.310> quadcopter<00:01:41.610> or

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
now that you have your quadcopter or

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.840 
now that you have your quadcopter or
helicopter<00:01:42.770> hovering<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:44.430> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> want

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
helicopter hovering you're going to want

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.210 
helicopter hovering you're going to want
to<00:01:44.880> pay<00:01:45.060> attention<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:46.170> inch<00:01:46.470> inputs

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
to pay attention to what inch inputs

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
to pay attention to what inch inputs
you're<00:01:47.340> putting<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.180> keep<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.659> hovering<00:01:49.350> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you're putting in to keep it hovering in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310 
you're putting in to keep it hovering in
one<00:01:49.799> spot<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:51.000> mine's<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> trim

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
one spot so if mine's really out of trim

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.889 
one spot so if mine's really out of trim
and<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:53.159> having<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.360> right

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and I'm having to put a lot of right

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.319 
and I'm having to put a lot of right
adjustment<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.520> ahead<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> land<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
adjustment in then go ahead and land it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.499 
adjustment in then go ahead and land it
and<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.520> trim<00:01:59.520> tab<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> direction

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and then put trim tab in the direction

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
and then put trim tab in the direction
that<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.869> were<00:02:00.990> correcting<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.950> I'm

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that you were correcting in so I'm

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
that you were correcting in so I'm
putting<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> lot<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> write<00:02:02.939> control<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.630> put<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
putting a lot of write control in put a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
putting a lot of write control in put a
lot<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.770> trim<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.570> go<00:02:06.719> ahead<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
lot of trim in and then go ahead and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
lot of trim in and then go ahead and
take<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.259> off<00:02:07.409> again<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.009> see<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> fixed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
take it off again and see if that fixed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.390 
take it off again and see if that fixed
the<00:02:09.360> problem<00:02:09.840> now<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:10.979> better<00:02:11.160> at

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the problem now as you get better at

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.070 
the problem now as you get better at
trimming<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.300> actually<00:02:12.450> trim<00:02:12.870> while

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
trimming you can actually trim while

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.309 
trimming you can actually trim while
it's

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's
in<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.499> air<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.159> of<00:02:14.219> people<00:02:14.549> like<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.819> trim

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
in the air a lot of people like to trim

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.610 
in the air a lot of people like to trim
it<00:02:15.180> when<00:02:15.299> it's<00:02:15.420> flying<00:02:15.629> but<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.079> you're<00:02:16.230> first

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
it when it's flying but if you're first

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.500 
it when it's flying but if you're first
getting<00:02:16.829> started<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.519> would<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:18.060> take<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.389> off

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
getting started I would just take it off

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.209 
getting started I would just take it off
find<00:02:19.019> out<00:02:19.139> what<00:02:19.290> direction<00:02:19.409> you're<00:02:19.920> needing

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
find out what direction you're needing

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.220 
find out what direction you're needing
to<00:02:20.489> put<00:02:20.670> corrections<00:02:21.239> in<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.749> keep<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.049> level

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
to put corrections in to keep it level

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.770 
to put corrections in to keep it level
and<00:02:22.469> then<00:02:23.189> go<00:02:23.459> ahead<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.670> land<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.090> make<00:02:24.659> your

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and then go ahead and land it make your

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.890 
and then go ahead and land it make your
adjustments<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:25.950> take<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.310> off<00:02:26.400> again

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
adjustments and then take it off again

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.970 
adjustments and then take it off again
now<00:02:27.900> different<00:02:28.290> controllers<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:28.799> going<00:02:28.920> to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
now different controllers are going to

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.459 
now different controllers are going to
have<00:02:29.129> different<00:02:29.489> trim<00:02:29.760> tabs<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.959> they<00:02:31.049> all<00:02:31.200> do

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
have different trim tabs but they all do

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.140 
have different trim tabs but they all do
the<00:02:31.590> same<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.159> is<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> cyma<00:02:32.760> controller

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the same thing this is a cyma controller

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.089 
the same thing this is a cyma controller
and<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> nice<00:02:34.170> thing<00:02:34.379> about<00:02:34.439> some<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> these

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
and the nice thing about some of these

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.619 
and the nice thing about some of these
bigger<00:02:35.370> controllers<00:02:35.909> is<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.329> can<00:02:36.480> actually

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
bigger controllers is you can actually

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.929 
bigger controllers is you can actually
see<00:02:36.900> how<00:02:37.109> much<00:02:37.290> trim<00:02:37.739> you're<00:02:38.219> correcting<00:02:38.670> for

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
see how much trim you're correcting for

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.349 
see how much trim you're correcting for
so<00:02:39.629> as<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.989> put<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.379> trim<00:02:40.879> you<00:02:41.879> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
so as you put in trim you can see the

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.110 
so as you put in trim you can see the
little<00:02:42.629> bar<00:02:42.780> down<00:02:43.019> here<00:02:43.669> you<00:02:44.669> can<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:44.969> your

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
little bar down here you can see your

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.470 
little bar down here you can see your
trim<00:02:45.419> get<00:02:45.599> higher<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.019> higher<00:02:47.120> okay<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.180> for

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
trim get higher and higher okay so for

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
trim get higher and higher okay so for
this<00:02:48.629> example<00:02:49.019> let's<00:02:49.349> say<00:02:49.530> your<00:02:49.680> helicopter

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
this example let's say your helicopter

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.459 
this example let's say your helicopter
is<00:02:50.310> out<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.549> trim<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:51.930> you're<00:02:52.049> gonna<00:02:52.139> do

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:52.469 
is out of trim so what you're gonna do

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:58.699 
is out of trim so what you're gonna do
is<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:53.069> your<00:02:53.099> trim<00:02:53.489> tab<00:02:53.730> here<00:02:57.620> you're<00:02:58.620> gonna

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
is with your trim tab here you're gonna

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.159 
is with your trim tab here you're gonna
correct<00:02:59.159> this<00:03:02.180> until<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.329> get<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.750> tail

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
correct this until you get that tail

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.899 
correct this until you get that tail
nice<00:03:04.949> and<00:03:05.400> steady<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.280> how<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.519> trim

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
nice and steady and that's how you trim

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.110 
nice and steady and that's how you trim
and<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.659> same<00:03:09.930> goes<00:03:10.230> for<00:03:10.260> side<00:03:10.889> side<00:03:11.310> back<00:03:12.060> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and the same goes for side side back and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
and the same goes for side side back and
forth<00:03:15.919> so<00:03:16.919> that's<00:03:17.069> my<00:03:17.280> tutorial<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.819> how<00:03:18.000> to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
forth so that's my tutorial on how to

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.020 
forth so that's my tutorial on how to
trim<00:03:18.509> your<00:03:18.750> helicopter<00:03:19.439> quadcopter<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.819> if

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030
