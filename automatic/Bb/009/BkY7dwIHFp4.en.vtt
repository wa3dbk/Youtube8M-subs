00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
impromptu seed video I've been hunting

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.620 
impromptu seed video I've been hunting
in<00:00:05.520> property<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:07.049> um<00:00:07.970> the<00:00:08.970> seed<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> is

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
in property so um the seed is is

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.240 
in property so um the seed is is
purgatory<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> lowercase<00:00:10.830> P<00:00:12.200> but

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
purgatory with a lowercase P but

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.379 
purgatory with a lowercase P but
apparently<00:00:14.250> I'm<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.519> only<00:00:14.700> person<00:00:14.849> who<00:00:15.210> gets

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
apparently I'm the only person who gets

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
apparently I'm the only person who gets
this<00:00:15.660> from<00:00:15.929> typing<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.529> scene<00:00:16.800> it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
this from typing in that scene it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.540 
this from typing in that scene it's
possible<00:00:17.850> i<00:00:18.000> typed<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.539> incorrectly<00:00:19.550> in

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
possible i typed it in incorrectly in

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.040 
possible i typed it in incorrectly in
which<00:00:20.730> case<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> end<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.660> video<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
will exit out of this world and run it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.099 
will exit out of this world and run it
through<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.029> those<00:00:24.180> programs<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.900> finds

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
through one of those programs that finds

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.130 
through one of those programs that finds
the<00:00:25.260> seed<00:00:26.189> number<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.820> provide<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the seed number and provide that in the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
the seed number and provide that in the
video<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> where<00:00:29.730> i<00:00:29.760> spawned<00:00:30.179> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
anything interesting and it's I'm at the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.289 
anything interesting and it's I'm at the
X<00:01:14.930> 3.30<00:01:16.070> 69<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.430> quite<00:01:17.549> close<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.000> zero

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
X 3.30 69 so it's quite close to zero

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.710 
X 3.30 69 so it's quite close to zero
zero<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> nobody<00:01:20.580> had<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> same<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.240> some

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
zero and nobody had the same thing some

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
zero and nobody had the same thing some
people<00:01:21.750> had<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> forest<00:01:22.470> fire<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.979> there's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
people had a forest fire I think there's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.170 
people had a forest fire I think there's
a<00:01:23.570> lava<00:01:24.570> stream<00:01:25.049> somewhere<00:01:25.500> around<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.180> but

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
a lava stream somewhere around here but

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.990 
a lava stream somewhere around here but
nobody<00:01:27.630> had<00:01:27.840> anything<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> I'm

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
nobody had anything like that so I'm

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.170 
nobody had anything like that so I'm
just<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.549> trace<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> edge<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just going to go and trace the edge of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
just going to go and trace the edge of
this<00:01:33.360> crazy<00:01:33.720> thing<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.350> looking<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.770> goes

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this crazy thing I mean looking it goes

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.310 
this crazy thing I mean looking it goes
down<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.970> still<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.700> insane<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> let's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
down there still it's insane so let's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.190 
down there still it's insane so let's
run<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.799> first

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.130 

um<00:01:46.030> looks<00:01:47.030> like<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.360> ends<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:48.020> there

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
um looks like it ends just there

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.560 
um looks like it ends just there
probably<00:01:51.140> some<00:01:51.409> kind<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:52.009> map<00:01:52.570> generating

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
probably some kind of map generating

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.740 
probably some kind of map generating
glitch<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:54.979> I've<00:01:55.460> never<00:01:55.610> had<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.969> before<00:01:56.090> my

1 has been doing tons of other stuff at

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.039 
1 has been doing tons of other stuff at
the<00:02:32.209> same<00:02:32.390> time<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:33.519> generating<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.700> world<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
the same time as generating a world the

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.940 
the same time as generating a world the
rest<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.470> world<00:02:36.680> at<00:02:37.040> first<00:02:37.340> glance<00:02:37.459> looks

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
rest of the world at first glance looks

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.490 
rest of the world at first glance looks
fine<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.190> normal<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.110> just

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
fine and normal but this this is just

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
fine and normal but this this is just
insane<00:02:45.769> i<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:49.010> thought<00:02:49.400> maybe<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.569> whole<00:02:50.810> area

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
insane i I thought maybe the whole area

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.710 
insane i I thought maybe the whole area
was<00:02:51.799> sort<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.130> sand<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.609> its<00:02:52.790> ankles<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.480> big

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
was sort of sand and its ankles of big

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.449 
was sort of sand and its ankles of big
hole<00:02:53.930> underneath<00:02:54.200> or<00:02:54.470> something<00:02:54.950> but<00:02:55.220> now<00:02:55.430> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
hole underneath or something but now I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.319 
hole underneath or something but now I
just<00:02:57.069> like<00:02:58.069> over<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> end<00:02:58.639> there's<00:02:58.880> patches

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
just like over the end there's patches

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.430 
just like over the end there's patches
of<00:02:59.359> land<00:02:59.600> still<00:02:59.989> there<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.889> that<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.880> is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
of land still there is and that bit is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.599 
of land still there is and that bit is
clearly<00:03:03.440> would<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.739> carried<00:03:04.010> on<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.220> be<00:03:04.430> dirt

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
clearly would have carried on to be dirt

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:11.259 
clearly would have carried on to be dirt
in<00:03:04.819> stone<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:09.470> very<00:03:09.829> interesting<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:11.180> was

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
in stone it's very interesting it was

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.009 
in stone it's very interesting it was
possible<00:03:11.870> when<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.280> exit<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> world<00:03:13.639> and

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
possible when I exit the world and

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.890 
possible when I exit the world and
re-enter<00:03:15.519> it'll<00:03:16.519> generate<00:03:16.760> properly<00:03:17.750> or

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
re-enter it'll generate properly or

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.949 
re-enter it'll generate properly or
something<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.280> before<00:03:20.150> i<00:03:20.329> did<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.690> i<00:03:20.780> just

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
something so before i did it i just

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.129 
something so before i did it i just
wanted<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.350> do<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.889> video<00:03:22.069> quickly<00:03:23.530> um<00:03:26.139> but

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
wanted to do this video quickly um but

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.500 
wanted to do this video quickly um but
if<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.380> does<00:03:27.560> stay<00:03:27.799> like<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:28.430> crazy<00:03:29.180> I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
if it does stay like this then crazy I

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.410 
if it does stay like this then crazy I
mean<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.639> bits<00:03:31.639> underwater<00:03:32.060> aren't

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
mean that is the bits underwater aren't

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.500 
mean that is the bits underwater aren't
flat<00:03:32.660> either<00:03:33.849> there's<00:03:34.849> like<00:03:35.000> land<00:03:35.209> masses

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
flat either there's like land masses

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:45.190 
flat either there's like land masses
under<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:37.540> masses<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.569> land

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.930 

and<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> big<00:03:46.830> box<00:03:47.099> either<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.819> not

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
and it's not a big box either it's not

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.869 
and it's not a big box either it's not
like<00:03:48.269> properly<00:03:48.870> square<00:03:49.260> shaped<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:50.670> a

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
like properly square shaped it's a

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:59.229 
like properly square shaped it's a
polygon<00:03:52.519> little<00:03:53.519> pumpkins<00:03:53.970> on<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.209> scene<00:03:54.420> and

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.240 

obviously<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:01.079> limited<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.739> one<00:04:01.920> chunk

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
obviously is not limited to one chunk

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.960 
obviously is not limited to one chunk
there<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.760> many<00:04:03.720> chunks<00:04:04.110> in<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:05.010> crazy<00:04:05.640> bit

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
there are many chunks in this crazy bit

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.009 
there are many chunks in this crazy bit
hey<00:04:06.420> squids<00:04:10.370> cuts<00:04:11.370> across<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.970> floaty<00:04:12.720> son

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
hey squids cuts across you floaty son

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.750 
hey squids cuts across you floaty son
bits<00:04:13.290> over<00:04:13.500> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.739> distance<00:04:14.129> there<00:04:16.760> under

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
bits over in the distance there under

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:27.560 
bits over in the distance there under
how<00:04:17.880> far<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> goes

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.910 

hopefully<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.330> now<00:04:31.420> it<00:04:31.600> gets<00:04:31.750> less<00:04:32.050> less

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
hopefully so now it gets less less

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.160 
hopefully so now it gets less less
apparent<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.670> like<00:04:33.940> bits<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.330> London<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.020> the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
apparent is like bits of London in the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:43.980 
apparent is like bits of London in the
water<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.880> drops<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.270> social<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.620> uh<00:04:42.990> it's

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
water the drops on social but uh it's

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.190 
water the drops on social but uh it's
still<00:04:44.290> there<00:04:45.070> i<00:04:45.100> mean<00:04:45.340> there's<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.930> clear<00:04:46.930> edge

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
still there i mean there's a clear edge

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.070 
still there i mean there's a clear edge
here<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.950> is<00:04:48.100> not<00:04:48.310> natural<00:04:48.850> I<00:04:51.810> can<00:04:52.810> see<00:04:52.960> it

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
here that is not natural I can see it

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.700 
here that is not natural I can see it
over<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.410> side<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:56.110> carry<00:04:56.320> on<00:04:56.470> walking

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
over that side to just carry on walking

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.190 
over that side to just carry on walking
down<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.250> way<00:04:57.490> and<00:05:00.510> see<00:05:01.510> what<00:05:01.630> happens<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.110> be

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
down this way and see what happens to be

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.910 
down this way and see what happens to be
down<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.530> end<00:05:07.110> okay<00:05:08.110> looks<00:05:08.380> like<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.770> may<00:05:08.890> be

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
down this end okay looks like it may be

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:16.210 
down this end okay looks like it may be
stops<00:05:09.610> here

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.640 

yeah<00:05:17.569> let's<00:05:18.569> go<00:05:18.780> over<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.960> other<00:05:19.080> side<00:05:19.139> see<00:05:19.530> if

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
yeah let's go over the other side see if

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.050 
yeah let's go over the other side see if
it<00:05:19.770> stops<00:05:20.069> in<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.250> same<00:05:20.490> place<00:05:20.639> over<00:05:20.970> the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
it stops in the same place over the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.580 
it stops in the same place over the
other<00:05:21.180> side<00:05:21.270> oh<00:05:23.689> no<00:05:24.689> is<00:05:24.870> carrying<00:05:25.289> on<00:05:25.379> over

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
other side oh no is carrying on over

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:31.390 
other side oh no is carrying on over
there

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:44.220 

we'd<00:05:34.220> do<00:05:35.220> some<00:05:35.400> island<00:05:35.819> hopping

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.320 

hmm

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.869 

and<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:49.470> don't<00:05:49.740> think<00:05:49.889> it's<00:05:50.129> just<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.430> weird

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
and I don't think it's just the weird

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.879 
and I don't think it's just the weird
placement<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.479> biomes<00:05:52.289> meeting<00:05:52.680> each<00:05:52.770> other

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
placement of biomes meeting each other

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.290 
placement of biomes meeting each other
because<00:05:53.189> nobody<00:05:53.460> else<00:05:53.580> had<00:05:53.819> this<00:05:54.000> when<00:05:54.210> they

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
because nobody else had this when they

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.089 
because nobody else had this when they
created<00:05:54.720> the<00:05:54.780> world<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:56.610> made<00:05:56.849> a<00:05:56.879> normal<00:05:57.419> world

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
created the world it made a normal world

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.730 
created the world it made a normal world
with<00:05:59.099> normal<00:05:59.490> stuff<00:06:03.050> so<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.169> comes<00:06:04.319> through

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
with normal stuff so it comes through

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.180 
with normal stuff so it comes through
this<00:06:04.949> bit

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:18.860 

Cody's<00:06:11.030> on<00:06:11.180> there

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.090 

goes<00:06:19.870> all<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.169> way<00:06:20.440> over<00:06:20.620> there<00:06:20.680> is<00:06:20.889> like<00:06:21.070> a

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
goes all the way over there is like a

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.159 
goes all the way over there is like a
great<00:06:21.370> wall<00:06:21.639> of<00:06:21.669> Minecraft<00:06:24.990> wonder<00:06:25.990> if<00:06:26.080> you

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
great wall of Minecraft wonder if you

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.810 
great wall of Minecraft wonder if you
could<00:06:26.350> see<00:06:26.560> this<00:06:26.710> from<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.039> satellite<00:06:27.550> above

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
could see this from the satellite above

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:38.740 
could see this from the satellite above
above<00:06:28.210> the<00:06:28.539> Minecraft<00:06:29.020> world

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.800 

I<00:06:38.870> didn't<00:06:39.830> look<00:06:39.950> like<00:06:40.010> it<00:06:40.190> was<00:06:40.540> going<00:06:41.540> on<00:06:41.660> the

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
I didn't look like it was going on the

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.590 
I didn't look like it was going on the
other<00:06:41.960> side<00:06:42.260> maybe<00:06:43.010> it<00:06:43.160> picks<00:06:43.370> up<00:06:43.490> again<00:06:43.640> after

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
other side maybe it picks up again after

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.150 
other side maybe it picks up again after
they<00:06:44.900> stretch<00:06:45.230> of<00:06:45.440> normal<00:06:46.630> okay<00:06:47.630> is<00:06:47.930> this<00:06:48.890> the

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
they stretch of normal okay is this the

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.370 
they stretch of normal okay is this the
end<00:06:52.240> and<00:06:53.240> all<00:06:53.660> this<00:06:53.840> still<00:06:54.110> pretty<00:06:54.380> sure<00:06:56.380> you

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720
