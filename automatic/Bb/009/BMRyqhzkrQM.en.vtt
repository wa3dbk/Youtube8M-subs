00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.209
 nightmare gadzhievna stirred up a wave 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:03.039
 speeches of opponents 

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:05.350
 free sale of weapons usa 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.859
 it seems 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.139
 those who advocate a ban on weapons 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.969
 specifically waiting for such tragedies 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.990
 to be able to reiterate 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.679
 yourself in full voice 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.420
 many even started talking custom 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.420
 evenness american 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 democracy 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.029
 arguing that such tragedies 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.759
 occur only because 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.699
 that the us weapon is also acquired 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.829
 easy as pies in booklets 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.210
 first it is not 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 many state laws 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 built in such a way that to buy 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.520
 even ordinary gun deal 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.570
 quite complex will not sell even 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.730
 if there is an adult citizen 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.079
 the slightest suspicion of his relationship with 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 law or his mental 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.200
 condition 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.530
 let alone make a connection between the budget of Omsk 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.020
 tragedies and the sale of weapons is simply not 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.000
 Seriously 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.580
 maniac preparing a cubist ul weapon 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.020
 I would find in any case, but if 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.270
 one of the victims was armed 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.340
 then the ability to resist would be 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.020
 much higher 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.239
 opportunity to buy a weapon for self-defense 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 one of the signs of the development of society 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.040
 and the usa ban on weapons is always 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920
 perceived as an assault on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 one of the main democratic 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.340
 freedoms 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.220
 until 1968 in the united states 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 weapons could be ordered by mail 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.130
 Of course, even then there was an age limit for 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.520
 gun ownership 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.920
 rifles but no one was surprised 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.470
 seeing on the street armed 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.020
 boy with passion 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.550
 canning shooter it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.070
 it was illegal but familiar at the same time 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.659
 even the police turned a blind eye to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.290
 such pranks for two reasons first 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800
 it never occurred to anyone that a teenager 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.710
 can use criminal weapons 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.170
 purposes and secondly the police too 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.520
 when they were children 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 we even went to school with weapons published 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.440
 school bus drivers 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.420
 coming home getting it back 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.520
 then times began to change dramatically in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.409
 the worst side of the authorities were forced 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.990
 complicate the process of buying weapons and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.630
 require parents completely 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.440
 isolate his children 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.240
 but time was apparently lost teenage 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.550
 gangs began to arm not only 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.220
 knives and unbalanced 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 schoolchildren to settle scores with objectionable 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.300
 teachers and bored 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.379
 classmates 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.809
 to many associate teenage 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.449
 aggressiveness with television cinema and 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.940
 computer games 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.419
 but at home and purpose there is another reason 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.219
 laws designed to protect rights 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.259
 teenagers have not left adults 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:29.679
 means of influencing their 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:30.369
 children 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.189
 even simple notes can be 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.059
 interpreted as mockery and 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.609
 interference with their privacy 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.619
 school georgia part hasn't happened yet 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.789
 tragedies like what happened 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.989
 for example in colorado and california these 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.299
 students opened fire on their 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.729
 classmates have many of them 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.569
 but calm is deceptive 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.719
 department representative 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.629
 state education like urine 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.089
 told us what was already 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.489
 few cases prevented 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.589
 when teens tried to carry in 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.129
 school firearms 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.169
 I have two teenager sons therefore 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:03.150
 weapons stored in a special safe here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.659
 from which none of my 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.199
 homemade 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.799
 but at the same time the weapon is 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.789
 integral part of american 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.729
 democracy provides rights 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:14.419
 citizens on self-defense means you need something like that 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.369
 to teach him the child is correct 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.419
 approach is 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.779
 to train children which is significant 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.089
 accordingly as reported 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.119
 what is this common cause 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:26.739
 no secret that in the us there are many 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.389
 opponents free sale 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.830
 firearms 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.390
 one of their arguments is just 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.710
 is its availability for 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.699
 teenagers 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.679
 but at the same time homicide statistics 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.079
 committed children shows that only 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.289
 7 percent of them used guns 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.489
 and pistols 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.390
 so the problem seems to be something else
