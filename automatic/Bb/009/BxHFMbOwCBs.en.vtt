00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.970
 very good andreo / sky team 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.350
 this would be 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.910
 exceptional of the mission of the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.830
 conspiracy of the renegades you have to 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.350
 left must be caught 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.330
 surrender about having egas you are going to 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.220
 attack the guardians of the city ​​always 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.070
 that you enter you have to let go like 3 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 or 4 days in the game so that you do not get 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.120
 they kill you directly nothing more green 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.850
 this is the principle the mission here we 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.590
 they give life and the truth that is very 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.580
 beautiful this mission I think that of all 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.239
 what I've done so far is the best 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.270
 of all entertained me a prison 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.790
 break or something like wow this would be the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.660
 no one's principle escapes the store or 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.670
 nobody in jail just do not let good 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:10.280
 to talk here and we went down the first one 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:12.200
 we find with him directly to 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.300
 talk to the chlorine that has to be behind 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.700
 of the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.640
 already pick a peak is assigned you take away 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.130
 all equipment but higher fat 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.070
 then you get it back at the end but 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.040
 you start now with nothing good you talk to me 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 with this now you're going to talk to this one 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 you tell him you want to go see the sea 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.450
 Waterways 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.509
 at the beginning but it 's skipping all 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.090
 missions or because there is in here that 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.700
 they are like a few trips that would be 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.520
 fight directly with him with this guy 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.219
 but it's pretty hard 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.369
 It can be done especially if you can 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.869
 throwing magic then you can heal 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.539
 for example of spear is a magic of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.060
 fire 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.450
 you're going to attack everyone you're going to die 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.130
 but if you do not get it if you do it right 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.840
 only when he hunted without healing you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.060
 can do when having mass like murcia already 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.459
 that you are here is this water in the area 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.310
 and do all the missions I think that 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.599
 it's better to ask you for a pinch 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 Although everyone walks with 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.440
 peaks asks you for a skewer to protect you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.440
 a small knife 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.860
 but even if you have the high level of 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.040
 persuade problems can you pass 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.810
 I do not know directly , I guess I do not know 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.650
 I have high then are the ministers 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.620
 couple is famous for making them 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.470
 well I want to talk to this one who is the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 what does this make the skewers 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.990
 you go with him, you ask him, you have been 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.390
 a little messenger in this area 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.590
 you could do it with him and he sends you 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 one or the other on scoop 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.530
 the one now 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.460
 what you can do is activate the mission 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.420
 in the missions menu activate the mission 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.100
 and it's going to point you directly though 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.800
 sometimes more or less the same site to other 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.350
 this what I did can persuade you 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.330
 it worked and the whole level of persuading 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.300
 with other basses and that the world is going to 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.960
 can do well take 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:32.680
 10 with the skewer is surprising me 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.680
 quite 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 everyone's life and there are many stories 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.680
 they begin to tell each one their story and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.680
 entertaining you already know that we have 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.210
 well before that we talk to this no 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.920
 release a pretty long roll since 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.599
 is 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 and asks us to listen, I think it's 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.620
 now if the story of another god another 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.620
 against pretty long talk 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.420
 and let's talk to him is this guy 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.430
 tells you a lot of things there 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.710
 altars because it's a good time I 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.900
 I'm going to talk to this one and I think it's 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.560
 when he asks us to kill one as proof 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.560
 of loyalty 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.280
 of corpse 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.360
 take care of him and we'll leave the class 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.630
 that we have here we can ask for a 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.630
 slower 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.010
 that they do not have armors are not three 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.010
 hits 4 and are women like a lady 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.789
 do not register it for if you had something not 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:59.789
 have nothing 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.240
 and we'll talk to him again now 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.840
 We activate the line 10 and valve 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:17.160
 of pressure thanks to us we know a 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:19.920
 little more brothers I had a problem of 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.750
 record the game from time to time 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.460
 every so often especially before 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.500
 pass on our doors to the one who does not 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.110
 you know why you can look for me 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.540
 what happened to me happened in this not the 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.920
 next door got through 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.110
 all these tunnels there are no fights nor 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.420
 nothing simply follow them and we get to the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.120
 end here gives us give us back all the 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:46.320
 team 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:48.120
 you have to match well but I recorded 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.460
 here in this door just before passing 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.900
 for this and now and the kind of for 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.280
 girl and leaving the city begin to 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.250
 stick against the city guards 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.720
 I the first time I got to help them 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.340
 hit the guards that happened is like a 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.140
 gas only place they attacked me 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.140
 they went up receiving 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.940
 but I loaded the game again and did not 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.890
 Attack no guard because the site does not 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.200
 he attacks them is not burned then they 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.400
 Here he explains what he is going to 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.139
 do is 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.980
 that means it's all your fault 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.920
 this book radical blame no 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.510
 in all good 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.510
 this is where I recorded the game to record 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.340
 here before leaving 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.000
 I do not see 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.000
 just in case 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.650
 although good if you go out and do not attack 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.650
 nobody will not have a problem 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.789
 this kind of skirmish to stick 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.379
 We all treat anyone here. 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.209
 put here we have completed the mission 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:53.089
 the mission is that it really ends here 

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:55.099
 but it happens that you can see this and 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:57.770
 it seems that there is no need to fight 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:07:00.169
 but but is that if you fight the league 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.090
 so do not let everyone go 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.320
 centuries to the end of the city and what 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:08.810
 what you have to do is leave the city 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.810
 here you see how two guards are used 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.340
 and it's finished 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.870
 while again in the city ​​and up 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.920
 the music changes everything is back in 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.360
 order 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.820
 not like the night I did was 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.980
 spend the hours to see if yes really 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.370
 everything was fine if it came back 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.370
 the people 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.460
 to make it day 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.100
 to see if the merchants appeared and it's 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.590
 my law first there was nothing but 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.590
 now they begin to appear suddenly one 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:52.320
 and is good for all that is the 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:55.190
 mission of those stories do not try 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.190
 bargain with me
