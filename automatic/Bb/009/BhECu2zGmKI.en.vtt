00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
which it constricts I thought about it

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.490 
which it constricts I thought about it
there's<00:03:15.340> no<00:03:15.579> point<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.090> teaching<00:03:16.510> me<00:03:16.720> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
there's no point to teaching me the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.819 
there's no point to teaching me the
