he'll be easy to find you can send your

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.149 
he'll be easy to find you can send your
supernaturals<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> try<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> summon<00:01:52.290> one

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
supernaturals there to try to summon one

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
supernaturals there to try to summon one
of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> great<00:01:53.490> powers<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> has<00:01:54.380> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
of the great powers that it has and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.600 
of the great powers that it has and
let's<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.430> actually

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
let's see if we can actually

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910 
let's see if we can actually
successfully<00:01:57.479> summon<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> hunter<00:01:58.259> storm<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
successfully summon the hunter storm and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
successfully summon the hunter storm and
that's<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> unique<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.729> for<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> werewolves

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
that's the unique one for the werewolves

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.030 
that's the unique one for the werewolves
right<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.170> Ryan<00:02:01.469> mentioned<00:02:01.710> there's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
right and like Ryan mentioned there's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.670 
right and like Ryan mentioned there's
different<00:02:02.430> effects<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.880> each

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
different effects for each

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.290 
different effects for each
natural<00:02:04.040> creatures<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.670> came<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
natural creatures that came with the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.640 
natural creatures that came with the
since<00:02:05.540> right<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.080> looks<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:06.440> we're

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
since right and it looks like we're

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.120 
since right and it looks like we're
successful<00:02:07.040> over<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.730> success<00:02:08.179> does<00:02:08.509> um

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
successful over here and success does um

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.950 
successful over here and success does um
success<00:02:10.130> counts<00:02:10.490> on<00:02:10.640> how<00:02:10.850> many<00:02:11.090> how<00:02:11.900> many

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
success counts on how many how many

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.570 
success counts on how many how many
supernaturals<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:12.980> summoning<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
supernaturals you have summoning the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.640 
supernaturals you have summoning the
stone<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.330> more<00:02:14.720> than<00:02:14.780> one<00:02:14.960> it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
stone so if you have more than one it

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.800 
stone so if you have more than one it
does<00:02:15.830> increase<00:02:16.100> your<00:02:16.370> chances<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.600> really

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
does increase your chances so the really

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
nice thing with the hunter storm for the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.860 
nice thing with the hunter storm for the
werewolves<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.209> they're<00:02:20.360> great<00:02:20.660> at
