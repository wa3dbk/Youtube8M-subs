00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.130
 we are on board the peugeot 508 station 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.010
 rich wagon of contents 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.719
 let's try to get an overview together with 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.780
 carlo hello hello 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.080
 then let's take a look miskov look 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.760
 those that are really many 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.720
 controls and many features that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.699
 then contribute to this comfort 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 this car I would immediately start from what 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.160
 I find myself in front of the steering wheel 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.079
 are all mipo commands and meanwhile 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960
 i do kids for cruise controls 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 control speed limiter the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 speed regulator and controls 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.969
 radio and telephone in time 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 connected they are all immediately after indeed 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.879
 immediately behind I see 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 the levers of the handcuffs 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 exactly tomorrow to say formula 1 in this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.030
 European robotic case and if six 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.640
 I also show the lever of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.250
 robotized gearbox just to give 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.600
 the idea of ​​what this means 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.439
 kind of technology or immediately right away 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 in front of me I see myself apologize 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.030
 the tachometer odometer if 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.070
 try a little act in the key 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's see how the ignition works 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.229
 this is to say that style in short 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.170
 aircraft took a little beyond the no 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 windward and this in the designer is not here 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.200
 in short, the style of the car or the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.240
 information that you can then see 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 in the center and the dashboard are those of the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 computer on board I say well 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.870
 are those of the on-board computer 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:51.500
 rather than an indication of direction 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:53.630
 of the navigator rather than the radio 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.660
 in part they are also shared and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.210
 shareable with the larger screen 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.070
 Central is clearly then here we have 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.470
 seen for a moment that it appeared 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 navigator that from the information in 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.260
 a more clearer and more immediate or I 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.210
 you are showing drawers a 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.740
 where you can against glass in 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.510
 carries practical handy tins 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.190
 then here I am focusing on the part 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.980
 radio and under automatic climate control 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.450
 automatic zone so I see that here 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.500
 there is the possibility of using the cd 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.000
 so I guess we also have 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.650
 youtube and usb sockets in the event that 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 lesson also open for a topic 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.160
 armrest and I find it here I am 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:49.670
 absurd so here we have the two 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.440
 taken in this case usb and the socket 12 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 then and inside the drawer 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.310
 very comfortable and discreet or the drawer 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.220
 which then among other things you showed me is 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.830
 also flows in the armrest case let's say 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.410
 flows forward and back by sum 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.350
 adapt to those that are style of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:12.080
 guide to the needs in the typology or 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:15.080
 then I see here the command joystick where 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.350
 clearly you can command the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.860
 let's say the navigator navigation 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.840
 the radio is the exact phone 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.390
 really everything more within reach 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.850
 hand or later I see two particular keys 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.620
 I see ss and with the peugeot logo that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.110
 serve yes what is called peugeot 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.470
 connect are nothing but two keys that 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.870
 they make you an emergency call though 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.390
 there is no phone connected the ss 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.130
 obviously calls 118 instead 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.680
 the peugeot symbol makes the call 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.750
 assistance assistance I understood yes 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 contact you they track you speak 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.110
 obviously speaking with the operator if 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.420
 does not respond in case of SOS obviously 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.590
 send the ambulance directly understood 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.610
 and I see here that there is also here in the part 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.220
 high of the high another series of 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.550
 side lights functionality 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.250
 courtesy we say there is no central one 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.890
 which illuminates the whole interior a little 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.250
 switching off the rear light and the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.610
 wheel used to control the curtain 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.080
 to obscure the roof or purpose of 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.330
 I show the roof here 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.120
 panoramic and the curtain that in this 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.890
 case since it is all closed and finds out 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.810
 then the panoramic roof 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.600
 here we can imagine then being able to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.760
 close completely or in a manner 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 partial precisely through this 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 this command or other features I see 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.020
 here there are beautiful opening of the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 luggage carrier opening the del 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.060
 compartment supply to those who 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.950
 that's the regulation 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.120
 of the inclination of the lights a 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.090
 glove compartment and then I also see 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.140
 the rates for sp news later 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.280
 the exclusion of the sps understood I understood 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.410
 good good good 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.720
 in short it seems that as far as we have 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.000
 tried to and here is the drawer 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.310
 refrigerated here is a drawer 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 refrigerated so we can quite 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:33.750
 roomy and certainly very comfortable 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.320
 obviously there are as many speakers 6 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.310
 there are 6 bars 8 depending on 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.050
 dell'allestimento 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.600
 obviously all the series a 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.210
 depending on the settings that are like 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.070
 remember setting them up based on access 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.890
 then there is the active that the inter doctor 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.190
 the one we are sitting on and a business 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.220
 which is nothing more than a bit more active 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.880
 equipped 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.510
 the aviator and then there is the top that is the 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.310
 their 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:06.970
 then the engines range from 1600 to 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.330
 diesel the 1600 petrol is both 120 and 156 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.920
 horses is random but is a 115 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:17.410
 horses 2140 manual gearboxes 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.070
 2163 horses manual and automatic gearbox 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.890
 which then it is true that there is also one 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.940
 hybrid version is just another 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.370
 car is the surf always mounts a 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.370
 2163 horsepower diesel automatic transmission 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.110
 and behind it was an electric motor of 37 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.160
 horses in such a way that only can 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.080
 take advantage of hybrid technology in via ho 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.820
 understood well well 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 as far as security is concerned you are not 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.940
 I ask questions I guess is at the top how 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:54.430
 then all the peugeot e range 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.850
 so let's say that on the latter 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.280
 future overview concerning the controls 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.260
 of the branches 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.840
 I greet you and give you an appointment a
