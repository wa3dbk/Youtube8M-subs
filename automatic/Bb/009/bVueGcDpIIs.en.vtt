 field verification to see if the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.480
 species are apt to develop or not 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.670
 in the region to which you are going to allocate 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.240
 clear is the function that really I 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.680
 he performed before granting the plant 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.160
 a field verification is done

 be able to determine if they are eligible or not

 let's grant each producer 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.259
 depending on the climate zone and the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.790
 soil we can give us species that do not 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.560
 they will develop because the results 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.290
 they would be negative 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.020
 and data thrown by the evaluations 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.000
 in the field they determine that 70 percent

 of the plants acquired in this nursery 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.430
