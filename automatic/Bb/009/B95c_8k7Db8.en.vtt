here's a button to lock and unlock your
Canon<00:00:45.360> lenses<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> test<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
Canon lenses and I'm going to test it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
Canon lenses and I'm going to test it
with<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> tamron<00:00:49.940> 17-50<00:00:52.489> 2.8<00:00:53.489> lens<00:00:54.289> canon<00:00:55.640> 50

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with the tamron 17-50 2.8 lens canon 50

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
with the tamron 17-50 2.8 lens canon 50
millimeter<00:00:57.090> 1.2<00:00:58.079> lens<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> i<00:01:00.440> wonder<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.680> there

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
millimeter 1.2 lens so i wonder if there

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.329 
millimeter 1.2 lens so i wonder if there
is<00:01:02.370> image<00:01:02.789> stabilization<00:01:03.500> support<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is image stabilization support and I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.170 
is image stabilization support and I
wonder<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.650> supports<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.340> focus<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
wonder if it supports out of focus so I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.020 
wonder if it supports out of focus so I
will<00:01:09.540> test<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:11.220> will<00:01:11.280> test<00:01:11.729> how<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
will test that and I will test how the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
will test that and I will test how the
aperture<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.020> controlled<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.720> i'm

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
aperture is controlled so and now i'm

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.630 
aperture is controlled so and now i'm
filming<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.900> phil<00:01:18.900> trucks<00:01:19.229> adapter<00:01:19.770> like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
filming with phil trucks adapter like

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.770 
filming with phil trucks adapter like
you<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.610> view<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> lens

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you see this is the view from the lens

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.749 
you see this is the view from the lens
and<00:01:32.210> i<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.570> tested<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:35.630> folks<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.869> infinity

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
and i also tested on folks to infinity

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:46.280 
and i also tested on folks to infinity
it<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.939> clearly<00:01:39.270> working<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:42.740> focus<00:01:43.790> just<00:01:45.290> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
it is clearly working it focus just to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
it is clearly working it focus just to
the<00:01:46.409> horizon<00:01:47.659> now<00:01:48.659> i'm<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> test<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the horizon now i'm going to test the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.800 
the horizon now i'm going to test the
image<00:01:51.869> stabilization<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.700> off

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.340 

and<00:01:59.930> now<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.979> hear<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:02.659> image<00:02:02.899> stabilization

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and now I hear the image stabilization

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.920 
and now I hear the image stabilization
turn<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:06.759> now<00:02:07.759> it's<00:02:07.970> on<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.569> clearly

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
turn and now it's on so this is clearly

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.330 
turn and now it's on so this is clearly
working<00:02:12.590> very<00:02:12.980> good<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:14.270> most<00:02:14.480> important

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
working very good the most important

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.270 
working very good the most important
function<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:17.319> course<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:18.680> changing<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
function of course is changing the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.360 
function of course is changing the
aperture<00:02:25.569> like<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.750> see<00:02:26.989> we<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.769> change<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
aperture like you see we can change the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:39.539 
aperture like you see we can change the
aperture<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.110> hear<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> clicking<00:02:33.890> noise

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.949 

but<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.700> does<00:02:40.880> work<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:43.130> too<00:02:43.310> bad<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
but it does work it's too bad of the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:55.210 
but it does work it's too bad of the
noise<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:48.430> glad<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.819> does<00:02:50.060> work<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:55.099> it

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
noise but I'm glad it does work and it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.220 
noise but I'm glad it does work and it
looks<00:02:55.489> like<00:02:55.580> it's<00:02:55.730> faster<00:02:58.630> than<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.750> aperture

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
looks like it's faster than the aperture

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.310 
looks like it's faster than the aperture
shift<00:03:00.650> in<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.420> next<00:03:02.420> lenses<00:03:04.840> now<00:03:05.840> I'm<00:03:06.019> going

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
shift in the next lenses now I'm going

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.539 
shift in the next lenses now I'm going
to<00:03:06.470> test<00:03:08.079> auto<00:03:09.079> focus<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:11.680> push<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.370> focus

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
to test auto focus I push out of focus

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:23.710 
to test auto focus I push out of focus
and<00:03:14.560> it<00:03:15.560> says<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:17.420> does<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:20.140> work<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:23.390> out<00:03:23.660> of

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and it says it does not work so out of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.180 
and it says it does not work so out of
focus<00:03:24.049> now<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> setting<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.180> lens<00:03:26.420> to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
focus now I setting the lens to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.550 
focus now I setting the lens to
autofocus<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.670> not<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.980> result<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.579> want<00:03:35.560> so

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
autofocus it's not the result I want so

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.240 
autofocus it's not the result I want so
for<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.310> stubborn<00:03:37.819> ends<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.480> autofocus<00:03:39.250> is

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
for the stubborn ends the autofocus is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.670 
for the stubborn ends the autofocus is
not<00:03:40.489> working<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:42.440> you<00:03:42.590> can<00:03:42.769> see<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:45.410> does

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
not working and like you can see it does

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.809 
not working and like you can see it does
not<00:03:45.889> focus<00:03:46.190> on<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:47.269> building<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.370> that's<00:03:49.670> a

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
not focus on the building so that's a

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.150 
not focus on the building so that's a
bummer<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.420> they<00:03:50.660> did<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.870> wedding<00:03:51.500> with

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
bummer and they did a wedding with

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.500 
bummer and they did a wedding with
