00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.230 

no<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.530> third<00:02:04.800> thing<00:02:05.330> similar<00:02:07.910> by<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.210> I

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
no the third thing similar by the way I

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.050 
no the third thing similar by the way I
should<00:02:09.420> point<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:11.400> first<00:02:11.760> one

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
should point out that the first one

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
should point out that the first one
Romero's<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.430> higher<00:02:14.970> number<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.660> stator

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
Romero's it's a higher number of stator

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.850 
Romero's it's a higher number of stator
magnets<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.050> second<00:02:19.350> one<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.500> showed<00:02:19.830> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
magnets and the second one I showed you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.970 
magnets and the second one I showed you
was<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:21.110> lower<00:02:22.110> number<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.650> Staters<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> here<00:02:28.860> we

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
was a lower number of Staters so here we

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.720 
was a lower number of Staters so here we
have<00:02:30.410> 12<00:02:33.140> magnets<00:02:34.140> on<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.320> rotor<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.100> 11

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
have 12 magnets on the rotor and 11

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.650 
have 12 magnets on the rotor and 11
stator<00:02:38.730> coils<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:44.660> that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
stator coils and as you can see that

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.170 
stator coils and as you can see that
also<00:02:46.970> travels<00:02:48.050> with<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:50.040> events<00:02:50.520> happening

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
also travels with the events happening

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.950 
also travels with the events happening
to<00:02:51.450> travel<00:02:51.870> with<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.380> rotation<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.810> rotor

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
to travel with the rotation of the rotor

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.310 
to travel with the rotation of the rotor
and<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.590> amount<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.920> interactions

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
and you get the amount of interactions

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.510 
and you get the amount of interactions
correspond<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.530> amount<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.800> magnets<00:03:02.280> on

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
correspond to the amount of magnets on

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.660 
correspond to the amount of magnets on
there<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> rotor

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
there on the rotor

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:12.290 
there on the rotor
so<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.880> was<00:03:06.470> clockwise<00:03:08.630> laughing<00:03:11.300> very

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
so that was clockwise laughing very

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.460 
so that was clockwise laughing very
similar<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.500> I've<00:03:13.650> got<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.840> time<00:03:16.110> more

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
similar but I've got this time more

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.550 
similar but I've got this time more
coils<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.670> have<00:03:17.850> magnets<00:03:18.390> namely<00:03:19.080> 11

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560

at<00:03:31.230> one<00:03:31.380> segment<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.580> can<00:03:32.610> see<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:36.239> events

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
at one segment you can see the events

at one segment you can see the events
happen<00:03:37.970> counterclockwise<00:03:38.970> or<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:40.620> opposite

really<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:47.160> conclusion<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.970> doesn't<00:03:48.330> matter

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
believe Bill Miller had 15 magnets on

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.810 
believe Bill Miller had 15 magnets on
its<00:04:24.930> rotor<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.400> 14<00:04:27.000> coils<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.800> as<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.610> can

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
see if I move it one segment that

sorry

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
sorry

sorry
clockwise<00:04:43.789> with<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:45.000> direction<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.630> travel

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
clockwise with the direction of travel

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960 
clockwise with the direction of travel
and<00:04:48.960> because<00:04:49.320> there's<00:04:49.890> more<00:04:50.310> magnets<00:04:50.789> and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
and because there's more magnets and

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.740 
and because there's more magnets and
coils<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:52.350> segment<00:04:53.150> travelled<00:04:54.150> is<00:04:54.450> much

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
coils the segment travelled is much

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.719 
coils the segment travelled is much
smaller<00:04:55.640> than<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.850> early<00:04:57.090> ones<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.450> showed<00:04:57.630> you

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
smaller than the early ones I showed you

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.640 
smaller than the early ones I showed you
so<00:04:59.729> I<00:05:01.310> should<00:05:02.310> imagine<00:05:02.490> there's<00:05:02.880> some<00:05:02.910> sort<00:05:03.450> of

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
so I should imagine there's some sort of

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.100 
so I should imagine there's some sort of
proportionality<00:05:04.650> between<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:06.599> events<00:05:06.900> going

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
proportionality between the events going

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.070 
proportionality between the events going
on<00:05:07.349> and<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.650> amount<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.010> magnets<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.640> have

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
on and the amount of magnets you have

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.990 
on and the amount of magnets you have
but<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.229> not<00:05:10.380> if<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:11.130> lower<00:05:11.849> number

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
but it's not if you have a lower number

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.930 
but it's not if you have a lower number
of<00:05:12.330> coils<00:05:12.660> than<00:05:13.050> magnets<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:14.460> events<00:05:14.789> will

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
of coils than magnets the events will

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.020 
of coils than magnets the events will
travel<00:05:18.860> with<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.039> direction<00:05:20.550> of<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.729> road<00:05:20.910> to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
travel with the direction of the road to

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.029 
travel with the direction of the road to
travel<00:05:22.310> but<00:05:23.310> I<00:05:23.370> think<00:05:23.610> what's<00:05:23.789> significant<00:05:24.479> is

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
travel but I think what's significant is

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:34.219 
travel but I think what's significant is
