00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:10.049
 youtube guys here another test that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.919
 is the sensor is the sensor ceiling 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.919
 water temperature 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 and here we have a retinue of unite the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:28.980
 that it is apparently in the favela that we 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:33.990
 we have here it says there that the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.150
 temperature should range is in my case in 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.850
 carnatal 90 degrees 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.960
 so he is giving 10.3 how many can 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.230
 see that in the table and 100 degrees is the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.250
 point three the first pool 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.390
 temperature resistance and would have attention 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.730
 attention in the tournament with 31 to 40 m 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.740
 Right dispute Let's see when I download 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.780
 the risk of being demoted 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.510
 to see if you're working 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 which is or is not 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.409
 so here 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.470
 It is only for those who need it and 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.430
 I wanted to take the test too, I did. 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.659
 negative of the last multimeter in turkey 27 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.510
 10 and 11 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.200
 I called 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.200
 I turned on the positive on 14 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.409
 Hot ogata I've even done schematic 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.520
 The one with the needle is in one because the guy 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.450
 do not step on the sapucaÃ­ 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.899
 can see that they end up 0.30 to three 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.899
 questions 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.159
 so it's within the parameters and 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.360
 now he's back in more than 90 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:08.440
 degrees you've already called from the kitchen 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:10.890
 Come on in. I know a little more. 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.890
 90 degrees 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.870
 so I believe that at this temperature 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.319
 at this temperature 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.319
 Me when I was mayor 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.050
 so tried to leave for the attack 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.210
 besson is the ceiling and love 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.580
 It was better for magic to see the 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.460
 temperature pt 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.460
 For me it goes down the goal making 70
