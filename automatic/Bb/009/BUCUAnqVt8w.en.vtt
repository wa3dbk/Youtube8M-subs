00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
too to keep the shape when you store

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.949 
too to keep the shape when you store
them<00:03:04.760> inside<00:03:05.750> there<00:03:06.020> but<00:03:06.620> also<00:03:07.040> paper<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.660> just

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
them inside there but also paper it just

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.960 
them inside there but also paper it just
regular<00:03:09.440> white<00:03:09.620> paper<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.550> before<00:03:10.850> they

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
regular white paper like before they

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.520
