this<00:00:00.089> coastline<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.890> few<00:00:02.100> years<00:00:02.250> time

this coastline in a few years time

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.539 
this coastline in a few years time
tourists<00:00:03.419> could<00:00:03.600> be<00:00:03.780> flocking<00:00:04.080> here<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:05.279> go

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
tourists could be flocking here to go

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:14.440 
tourists could be flocking here to go
into<00:00:05.879> space

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.650 

by<00:00:15.470> 2018<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:17.130> airfield<00:00:17.640> could<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> place

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
by 2018 this airfield could be the place

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.990 
by 2018 this airfield could be the place
that<00:00:18.690> people<00:00:19.080> come<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:20.520> into<00:00:20.880> orbit

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500 

seems<00:00:24.870> like<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.200> stuff<00:00:25.620> of<00:00:25.830> science<00:00:26.010> fiction

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
seems like the stuff of science fiction

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.150 
seems like the stuff of science fiction
but<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.690> government<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.470> does<00:00:28.770> want<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
but the government really does want to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.150 
but the government really does want to
have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> launch<00:00:29.760> site<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.420> space<00:00:30.750> planes

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
have a launch site for space planes

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.200 
have a launch site for space planes
somewhere<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.790> UK<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:34.640> just<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> few<00:00:35.940> years

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210

somewhere in the UK in just a few years
lots<00:00:36.720> of<00:00:36.989> people<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.620> turning<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.130> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
lots of people could be turning up to

lots of people could be turning up to
airports<00:00:38.820> wearing<00:00:39.540> astronaut<00:00:40.170> suits<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
being sent into orbit the plan is to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
being sent into orbit the plan is to
convert<00:00:44.790> an<00:00:45.059> existing<00:00:45.210> airfield<00:00:46.170> such<00:00:46.590> as

convert an existing airfield such as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.820 
convert an existing airfield such as
this<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.370> lamboda<00:00:47.790> in<00:00:48.030> north<00:00:48.269> wales<00:00:48.830> space

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
this one in lamboda in north wales space

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.369 
this one in lamboda in north wales space
planes<00:00:50.220> could<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.879> taking<00:00:51.330> off<00:00:51.540> from<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
planes could be taking off from this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
planes could be taking off from this
very<00:00:52.860> runway<00:00:53.430> carrying<00:00:54.269> people<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> also

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
very runway carrying people and also

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090 
very runway carrying people and also
british-made<00:00:56.899> satellites<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.770> isn't<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
british-made satellites there isn't a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
british-made satellites there isn't a
working<00:00:59.309> space<00:00:59.700> plane<00:01:00.210> yet<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.200> companies

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
working space plane yet but companies

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.460 
working space plane yet but companies
are<00:01:01.920> designing<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.840> takes<00:01:04.259> off

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
are designing them this one takes off

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
are designing them this one takes off
and<00:01:04.770> then<00:01:05.399> fires<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> spacecraft<00:01:06.660> with

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and then fires a spacecraft with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.370 
and then fires a spacecraft with
tourists<00:01:07.590> into<00:01:08.160> space<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.259> here's<00:01:10.259> another

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
tourists into space and here's another

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.139 
tourists into space and here's another
idea<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:11.310> two-seater<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> joyride<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:14.149> this

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
idea a two-seater for a joyride and this

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.240 
idea a two-seater for a joyride and this
space<00:01:15.509> plane<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.229> satellites<00:01:17.009> into

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
space plane can take satellites into

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.790 
space plane can take satellites into
orbit<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.940> then<00:01:18.600> come<00:01:18.899> back<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.320> earth<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
orbit and then come back to earth I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.980 
orbit and then come back to earth I
think<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.789> UK<00:01:21.119> has<00:01:21.240> been<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.690> know<00:01:21.780> played<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
think the UK has been you know played a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.960 
think the UK has been you know played a
major<00:01:22.229> role<00:01:22.440> in<00:01:22.649> space<00:01:23.160> ever<00:01:23.430> since<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.789> first

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
major role in space ever since we first

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.170 
major role in space ever since we first
went<00:01:24.210> into<00:01:24.570> space<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:25.500> 50<00:01:25.800> years<00:01:26.009> ago<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.280> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
went into space over 50 years ago now so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
went into space over 50 years ago now so
we<00:01:27.270> build<00:01:27.619> spacecraft<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:29.010> build<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.340> build

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
we build spacecraft we build we build

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.130 
we build spacecraft we build we build
satellites<00:01:29.790> instruments<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.900> board

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
satellites instruments that go on board

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.570 
satellites instruments that go on board
but<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.830> it's<00:01:32.040> probably<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.400> bit

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
but I think it's probably a little bit

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.940 
but I think it's probably a little bit
hard<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:32.939> people<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.840> engage<00:01:34.080> directly<00:01:34.619> with

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
hard for people to engage directly with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.880 
hard for people to engage directly with
it<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.580> having<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.970> spaceport<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.590> UK

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it so having a spaceport well in the UK

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.640 
it so having a spaceport well in the UK
where<00:01:38.780> stuff<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.810> launched<00:01:40.439> directly

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
where stuff is launched directly

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
where stuff is launched directly
dispersed<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:41.909> certainly<00:01:42.210> make

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
dispersed from here will certainly make

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
dispersed from here will certainly make
it<00:01:42.420> much<00:01:42.659> more<00:01:42.810> real<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.049> people<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:44.040> they

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it much more real for people some they

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
it much more real for people some they
believe<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.939> space<00:01:45.330> tourism<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> probably<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
believe that space tourism is probably a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.520 
believe that space tourism is probably a
step<00:01:48.000> too<00:01:48.390> far
