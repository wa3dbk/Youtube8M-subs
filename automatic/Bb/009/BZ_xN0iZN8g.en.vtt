00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
about my gear setup first of all I use

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.390 
about my gear setup first of all I use
all<00:00:05.460> proko<00:00:06.180> guardian<00:00:06.779> cables<00:00:07.230> just<00:00:07.859> as<00:00:08.040> far<00:00:08.250> as

reliability<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.330> tone<00:00:09.540> that's<00:00:09.900> been<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
reliability and tone that's been the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.310 
reliability and tone that's been the
best<00:00:10.440> thing<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.070> found<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:13.080> first

best thing that I found and the first
thing<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.740> chain<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> boss<00:00:14.910> line

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
thing in the chain is a boss line

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.010 
thing in the chain is a boss line
selector<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.940> splits<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.390> guitar<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
selector and it splits the guitar and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.810 
selector and it splits the guitar and
the<00:00:19.109> Rhodes

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
the Rhodes

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
the Rhodes
rope<00:00:20.820> guitar<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.240> Rhodes<00:00:21.420> go<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.050> come

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
rope guitar and Rhodes go in here come

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.670 
rope guitar and Rhodes go in here come
out<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:23.400> line<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.750> next<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> chain

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
out one line here then next in the chain

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.130 
out one line here then next in the chain
is<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.580> compressor<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.750> use<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
is the compressor and I just use that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.130 
is the compressor and I just use that
for<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.619> single<00:00:29.580> melody<00:00:30.539> lines<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
for like single melody lines just to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.400 
for like single melody lines just to
kind<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.710> even<00:00:31.920> everything<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.669> little<00:00:32.910> bit

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
kind of even everything out a little bit

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.310 
kind of even everything out a little bit
then<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> compressor<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.730> goes<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
then from the compressor it goes to the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.430 
then from the compressor it goes to the
RMC<00:00:37.890> wah<00:00:38.180> which<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.989> wha<00:00:40.140> that's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
RMC wah which is kind of a wha that's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.389 
RMC wah which is kind of a wha that's
geared<00:00:40.770> more<00:00:40.950> towards<00:00:41.399> humbuckers<00:00:43.250> after<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
geared more towards humbuckers after the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.049 
geared more towards humbuckers after the
wha

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
wha

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.130 
wha
it<00:00:45.180> goes<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:46.910> distortion<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.629> distortion

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it goes to distortion and the distortion

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
it goes to distortion and the distortion
box<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.070> Texas<00:00:50.489> two-step<00:00:51.050> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
box and I use the Texas two-step it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
box and I use the Texas two-step it's
got<00:00:52.199> two<00:00:52.440> different<00:00:52.649> gains<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> distortion

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
got two different gains of distortion

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
got two different gains of distortion
the<00:00:54.000> first<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.680> slightly<00:00:56.250> starting

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the first one is just slightly starting

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.150 
the first one is just slightly starting
to<00:00:56.850> break<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> second<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
to break up and then the second one is a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.119 
to break up and then the second one is a
pretty<00:00:59.460> full-on<00:00:59.730> second<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.449> Distortion

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pretty full-on second game Distortion

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
pretty full-on second game Distortion
after<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.260> rat<00:01:04.500> pedal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
after that one we go to the rat pedal

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.310 
after that one we go to the rat pedal
and<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.150> used<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:06.930> general

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and this is just used for general

this one on and finger tap or whatever

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.140 
this one on and finger tap or whatever
to<00:01:15.130> do<00:01:15.280> at<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.610> point<00:01:16.290> after<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.650> rat<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.880> go

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
to do at that point after the rat we go

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.300 
to do at that point after the rat we go
to<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:21.490> green<00:01:21.760> pedal<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.540> line<00:01:23.080> six<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.070> I

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
to this green pedal the line six and I

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.290 
to this green pedal the line six and I
used<00:01:24.580> this<00:01:24.820> one<00:01:25.060> for<00:01:25.960> looping<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.220> then<00:01:28.030> also

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
used this one for looping and then also

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.830 
used this one for looping and then also
I've<00:01:28.630> got<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.869> tube<00:01:29.200> echo<00:01:29.560> patch<00:01:30.450> reverse<00:01:31.450> patch

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
I've got a tube echo patch reverse patch

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.210 
I've got a tube echo patch reverse patch
and<00:01:32.410> then<00:01:33.180> multi-head<00:01:34.259> tape<00:01:35.259> echo<00:01:35.500> patch<00:01:35.979> as

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and then multi-head tape echo patch as

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.790 
and then multi-head tape echo patch as
well<00:01:36.660> after<00:01:37.660> that<00:01:37.930> when<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.200> go<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.590> blue

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
well after that when we go to the blue

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.060 
well after that when we go to the blue
line<00:01:38.830> six<00:01:39.460> and<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.759> just<00:01:39.970> use<00:01:40.440> unified<00:01:41.440> patches

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
line six and I just use unified patches

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.930 
line six and I just use unified patches
out<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.580> one<00:01:42.790> Tremeloes<00:01:44.430> phasors<00:01:45.430> and

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
out of this one Tremeloes phasors and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.850 
out of this one Tremeloes phasors and
then<00:01:46.060> there's<00:01:46.240> also<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.570> ring<00:01:46.869> modulator<00:01:47.470> that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
then there's also a ring modulator that

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.090 
then there's also a ring modulator that
I<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.399> some<00:01:48.729> on<00:01:49.090> this<00:01:49.390> one

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
I use some on this one

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.120 
I use some on this one
after<00:01:51.100> those<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.820> go<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:53.050> boss<00:01:53.560> volume

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
after those I go to the boss volume

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.490 
after those I go to the boss volume
pedal<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.390> reason<00:01:55.660> I<00:01:55.750> put<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.080> there<00:01:56.140> is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
pedal and the reason I put that there is

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.499 
pedal and the reason I put that there is
because<00:01:56.649> sometimes<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.340> need<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.520> create<00:01:58.180> loops

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
because sometimes I need to create loops

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.139 
because sometimes I need to create loops
without<00:01:59.140> anybody<00:01:59.590> hearing<00:01:59.979> them<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.759> can<00:02:01.030> do

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
without anybody hearing them so I can do

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.100 
without anybody hearing them so I can do
that<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.720> before<00:02:01.990> it<00:02:02.470> hits<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:04.110> from

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
that in this before it hits this so from

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.680 
that in this before it hits this so from
here<00:02:05.140> volume<00:02:05.979> blasting<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.060> chain<00:02:07.330> is

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
here volume blasting and the chain is

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.520 
here volume blasting and the chain is
the<00:02:08.039> boss<00:02:09.039> CD<00:02:09.640> 20<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:11.140> use<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.330> analog

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the boss CD 20 and I use the analog

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.040 
the boss CD 20 and I use the analog
delay<00:02:14.530> most<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:15.880> but<00:02:16.450> I've<00:02:16.540> also<00:02:16.690> got

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
delay most on this one but I've also got

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.420 
delay most on this one but I've also got
set<00:02:17.440> up<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.800> reverse<00:02:18.160> delay<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.900> tape<00:02:20.650> delay<00:02:21.040> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
set up a reverse delay a tape delay and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.789 
set up a reverse delay a tape delay and
then<00:02:21.549> also<00:02:21.730> I've<00:02:21.940> got<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> pan<00:02:22.450> delay<00:02:22.840> for<00:02:23.709> my

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
then also I've got a pan delay for my

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.360 
then also I've got a pan delay for my
stereo<00:02:24.310> rig<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:26.680> well<00:02:26.950> there's<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
stereo rig and as well there's like a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.580 
stereo rig and as well there's like a
manual<00:02:27.730> setting<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.440> use

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
manual setting on here and I just use

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
manual setting on here and I just use
the<00:02:29.769> standard<00:02:30.340> delay<00:02:30.940> for<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:32.160> from<00:02:33.160> here<00:02:33.430> it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the standard delay for that from here it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.140 
the standard delay for that from here it
splits<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.690> then<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.019> goes<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.410> my<00:02:35.560> amps<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
splits and then it goes to my amps the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.479 
splits and then it goes to my amps the
first<00:02:37.390> amp<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.280> bad<00:02:39.280> cat<00:02:39.640> code<00:02:39.970> -<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.280> play

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
first amp is bad cat code - and I play

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.240 
first amp is bad cat code - and I play
that<00:02:42.519> through<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> mr.<00:02:43.450> boogie<00:02:43.780> 212<00:02:44.440> close<00:02:44.890> back

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it and then last but not least I have

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.720 
it and then last but not least I have
this<00:03:13.480> box<00:03:13.810> which<00:03:14.440> was<00:03:15.010> invented<00:03:15.370> by<00:03:15.700> our

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
this box which was invented by our

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.500 
this box which was invented by our
German<00:03:16.120> bwak<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:18.100> basically<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.640> use<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.300> for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
German bwak and basically I use this for

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.960 
German bwak and basically I use this for
a<00:03:19.570> whole<00:03:19.720> bunch<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:20.020> different<00:03:20.140> stuff<00:03:20.970> this

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
a whole bunch of different stuff this

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.260 
a whole bunch of different stuff this
knob<00:03:22.390> right<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:23.280> controls<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.610> rotation<00:03:24.760> of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
knob right here controls the rotation of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.690 
knob right here controls the rotation of
the<00:03:25.390> earth<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.710> farther<00:03:27.010> left<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.520> go

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
the earth like the farther left you go

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.320 
the earth like the farther left you go
the<00:03:28.450> earth<00:03:28.900> slower<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.100> earth<00:03:30.220> goes<00:03:30.520> as<00:03:31.150> you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
the earth slower the earth goes as you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.420 
the earth slower the earth goes as you
dial<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:32.020> more<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.380> right<00:03:32.590> or

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
dial it a little more to the right or

dial it a little more to the right or
starts<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> spin<00:03:34.450> up<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.750> little<00:03:34.930> bit<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:36.310> then

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
starts to spin up a little bit and then

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.630 
starts to spin up a little bit and then
there's<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.870> toggle<00:03:38.620> switch<00:03:38.830> right<00:03:39.340> here

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
there's this toggle switch right here

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.820 
there's this toggle switch right here
when<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.450> hit<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:40.810> toggle<00:03:41.200> switch<00:03:41.380> during

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
you know notches to the left and then it

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.140 
you know notches to the left and then it
like<00:04:11.469> release<00:04:11.859> takes<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.430> humidity<00:04:12.969> out<00:04:13.120> of

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
like release takes the humidity out of

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.890 
like release takes the humidity out of
the<00:04:13.299> room<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.400> then<00:04:15.790> let's<00:04:16.150> see<00:04:16.329> what<00:04:16.509> else<00:04:16.720> is

and I

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.689 
and I
can't<00:05:16.439> really<00:05:16.710> remember<00:05:16.949> who<00:05:17.250> that<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.669> right

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
can't really remember who that is right

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.980 
can't really remember who that is right
now<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:21.030> don't<00:05:21.300> really<00:05:21.360> use<00:05:21.629> that<00:05:21.840> one

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
now so I don't really use that one

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.540 
now so I don't really use that one
either<00:05:22.199> very<00:05:22.530> much<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> don't<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.430> don't

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
either very much so I don't I don't

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.700 
either very much so I don't I don't
really<00:05:23.819> know<00:05:24.030> what<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.330> does<00:05:24.509> but<00:05:25.319> it's<00:05:25.469> just

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
really know what it does but it's just

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.439 
really know what it does but it's just
safer<00:05:26.159> you<00:05:26.310> know<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:28.490> just<00:05:29.490> not<00:05:29.699> use<00:05:29.969> that<00:05:30.210> one

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
safer you know to just not use that one

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.980 
safer you know to just not use that one
basically<00:05:31.379> so<00:05:31.979> that's<00:05:32.849> it<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.419> mean<00:05:33.780> that's

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
basically so that's it I mean that's

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.279 
basically so that's it I mean that's
pretty<00:05:34.289> much<00:05:34.469> all<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:35.009> my<00:05:35.129> gear<00:05:35.340> setup<00:05:35.699> and<00:05:36.289> how

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.490 
pretty much all of my gear setup and how
I<00:05:37.349> achieved<00:05:37.919> the<00:05:38.189> tones<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.759> I<00:05:38.909> use<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.500> hope

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500
