00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
deck from end to end and side to side

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.360 
deck from end to end and side to side
next<00:00:34.290> thing<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> design

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
next thing if you want to have a design

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
next thing if you want to have a design
in<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:37.640> lay<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:39.059> grip<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.750> deck

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
in it and lay your grip and your deck

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.010 
in it and lay your grip and your deck
side<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.320> side<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.969> see<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.600> where<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
side by side and see about where the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
side by side and see about where the
holes<00:00:43.290> are<00:00:43.610> because<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.090> your

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
holes are because you don't want your

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
holes are because you don't want your
design<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.980> on<00:00:46.980> top<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> holes<00:00:47.670> aren't

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
design to go on top of the holes aren't

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.869 
design to go on top of the holes aren't
really<00:00:48.510> close<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.610> have<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> two

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
really close to them I have the two

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
really close to them I have the two
parts<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.420> design<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> next<00:00:55.379> part

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
parts to my design so the next part

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.099 
parts to my design so the next part
you're<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.610> gonna<00:00:56.760> begin<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> lay<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you're just gonna begin to lay on the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.520 
you're just gonna begin to lay on the
grip<00:00:58.320> tape<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:59.070> I'll<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> second<00:01:00.530> so

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
grip tape which I'll do in a second so

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.869 
grip tape which I'll do in a second so
when<00:01:01.680> laying<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.340> grip<00:01:02.520> tape<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
when laying down your grip tape the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
when laying down your grip tape the
first<00:01:03.120> side<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
first side that I like to do is the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490 
first side that I like to do is the
shortest<00:01:04.860> side<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.750> simply<00:01:07.110> peel<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
shortest side so you just simply peel it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
shortest side so you just simply peel it
off<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> paper<00:01:08.400> backing<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> line

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
off of the paper backing and then line

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
off of the paper backing and then line
it<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:11.299> and<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> especially<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> have

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it up and if you especially if you have

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
it up and if you especially if you have
a<00:01:13.619> design<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.670> gonna<00:01:14.760> try<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.060> make

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a design in it you're gonna try and make

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.940 
a design in it you're gonna try and make
the<00:01:15.990> edges<00:01:16.170> straight<00:01:17.240> it'll<00:01:18.240> turn<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.450> better

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
the edges straight it'll turn out better

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.289 
the edges straight it'll turn out better
first<00:01:19.950> thing<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> lay<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> down<00:01:20.970> from

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
first thing you do is lay it down from

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.510 
first thing you do is lay it down from
the<00:01:21.420> middle<00:01:21.659> press<00:01:21.840> into<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> concave<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the middle press into the concave and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
the middle press into the concave and
keep<00:01:23.790> pressing<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.240> until<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> get<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
keep pressing it down until you get to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.429 
keep pressing it down until you get to
one<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> kicks<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.580> press<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.439> right

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
one of the kicks and then press it right

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.899 
one of the kicks and then press it right
when<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> kick<00:01:29.040> starts<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> want

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
when the kick starts up because you want

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
when the kick starts up because you want
to<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.329> deep<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.780> possible<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
to have it as deep as possible on the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.640 
to have it as deep as possible on the
deck<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> also<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> lot

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
deck because then you also get a lot

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.359 
deck because then you also get a lot
more<00:01:34.680> responsiveness<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
more responsiveness and you're going to

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.520 
more responsiveness and you're going to
do<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> same<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> other

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.650 

now<00:01:43.770> you're<00:01:44.770> going<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.980> do<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.660> most

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
now you're going to do the most

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.420 
now you're going to do the most
important<00:01:47.080> part<00:01:47.320> which<00:01:48.040> you're<00:01:48.250> gonna<00:01:48.370> need

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
important part which you're gonna need

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.660 
important part which you're gonna need
your<00:01:48.580> file<00:01:48.940> for<00:01:49.800> so<00:01:50.800> you're<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:50.979> gonna<00:01:51.160> kind

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
your file for so you're just gonna kind

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.940 
your file for so you're just gonna kind
of<00:01:51.729> go<00:01:51.850> on<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> edge<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:55.620> just<00:01:56.620> start

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
of go on the edge of it and just start
