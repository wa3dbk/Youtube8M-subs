money off of the the support and that
people<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> wait<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.250> long<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.850> see

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
people don't have to wait so long to see

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
people don't have to wait so long to see
that<00:00:45.360> their<00:00:45.600> voices<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.079> been<00:00:46.140> heard<00:00:46.410> yeah

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that their voices have been heard yeah

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.900 
that their voices have been heard yeah
so<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.570> know<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.620> don't<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.730> it's

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so you know I think I don't think it's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
so you know I think I don't think it's
really<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> move<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:52.050> read<00:00:52.500> into<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
really a move that we can read into that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.310 
really a move that we can read into that
much<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.660> interesting<00:00:54.809> move

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
much I think it's an interesting move

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
much I think it's an interesting move
for<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.280> reasons<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.120> discussed<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
for the reasons we just discussed but I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
for the reasons we just discussed but I
you<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> same<00:00:59.579> time<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.210> it's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you know I at the same time I think it's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.590 
you know I at the same time I think it's
completely<00:01:00.480> separate<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.730> whether<00:01:02.730> he

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
completely separate from whether he

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.149 
completely separate from whether he
would<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.870> included<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> character<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> don't

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
would be included as a character I don't

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.260 
would be included as a character I don't
think<00:01:05.339> they've<00:01:05.460> kincaid<00:01:05.820> ruled<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
think they've kincaid ruled them out I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
think they've kincaid ruled them out I
just<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.720> they're<00:01:06.810> capitalizing<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
just think they're capitalizing on the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
just think they're capitalizing on the
opportunity<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.909> mean<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.869> an

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
opportunity yeah I mean I don't have an

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
opportunity yeah I mean I don't have an
opinion<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> other<00:01:10.920> either<00:01:11.280> as

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
opinion one way or the other either as

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
opinion one way or the other either as
to<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.119> means<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to what this means but I think a lot of

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
to what this means but I think a lot of
people<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.890> been<00:01:13.920> looking<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.820> thinking<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
people have been looking at thinking of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
people have been looking at thinking of
the<00:01:15.659> way<00:01:15.750> they've<00:01:16.140> been<00:01:16.170> approaching<00:01:16.590> new

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the way they've been approaching new

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.010 
the way they've been approaching new
content<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> Smash<00:01:18.270> Bros<00:01:18.450> games<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
content in in the Smash Bros games and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.980 
content in in the Smash Bros games and
and<00:01:19.350> thinking<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.299> they<00:01:21.479> figured<00:01:21.869> out

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and thinking you know they figured out

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
and thinking you know they figured out
kind<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> rules<00:01:22.770> sakurai<00:01:23.430> has<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.939> place

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
kind of the rules sakurai has in place

for for building new content when pretty

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.429

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
much moat every rule that's that's been

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
much moat every rule that's that's been
conceived<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.280> far<00:01:29.549> has<00:01:30.030> been<00:01:30.390> shattered<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
would never be more than one third party

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
would never be more than one third party
character<00:01:34.680> per<00:01:34.950> company<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.090> have

this<00:01:52.259> costumes<00:01:52.920> rule<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.759> people<00:01:54.030> seem<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this costumes rule that people seem to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
this costumes rule that people seem to
be<00:01:54.360> assuming<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> character

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
be assuming which is that if a character

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.340 
be assuming which is that if a character
gets<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.189> costume<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.329> aren't<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
gets a costume but aren't is not in the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.749 
gets a costume but aren't is not in the
game<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.710> means<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.130> won't<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
game that means they won't be in the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.929 
game that means they won't be in the
game<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
game you know I think that's that's a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
game you know I think that's that's a
big<00:02:03.390> too<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.930> leap<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.380> have

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
big too much of a leap because we have

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
big too much of a leap because we have
gotten<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> lot<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.070> post-release<00:02:05.549> costumes

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
gotten a lot of post-release costumes

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.550 
gotten a lot of post-release costumes
that<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.360> been<00:02:06.719> tied<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> characters<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that have been tied to characters that

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
that have been tied to characters that
are<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> game<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.539> really

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
are actually in the game so there really

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.809 
are actually in the game so there really
isn't<00:02:10.050> an<00:02:10.349> observable<00:02:11.129> pattern<00:02:11.430> yet<00:02:11.640> in

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
isn't an observable pattern yet in

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.950 
isn't an observable pattern yet in
particular<00:02:12.270> because<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:13.050> all<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.500> DLC

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
particular because not all of the DLC

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.390 
particular because not all of the DLC
come<00:02:14.170> out<00:02:14.260> yet<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.590> we<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:14.800> can't<00:02:14.920> make<00:02:15.190> any

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
come out yet so we really can't make any

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.900 
come out yet so we really can't make any
judgment<00:02:15.760> yeah<00:02:16.420> cuz<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.380> saw<00:02:17.910> when

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
judgment yeah cuz you know we saw when

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.730 
judgment yeah cuz you know we saw when

they revealed the Meta Knight mask

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.500 
they revealed the Meta Knight mask

we now have a Samus costume so I don't

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
men in the Black Knight I don't think a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.290 
men in the Black Knight I don't think a
costume<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.830> any<00:02:36.400> indication<00:02:36.850> that<00:02:37.120> they

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
costume is any indication that they

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.060 
costume is any indication that they
could<00:02:37.540> be<00:02:37.750> coming<00:02:38.050> in<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.170> future<00:02:38.320> but
