00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 hello i am the milestone of samsung and today i 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.599
 I have come to present to you our 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 launch the galaxy note 4 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 one of the things that draws a lot of attention 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.020
 on the other four galaxy is your screen it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 has a 5-point screen 7 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 inches 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.769
 I have a resolution on almost HD or 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.140
 be four times the HD without counting 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.810
 it comes with a super amoled too or 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 super amoled brings me a resolution and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
 mainly color and brightness much more 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 aggressive 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 I brought up with a screen here is that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.579
 There's no super amoled where I can 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110
 realize the difference to be more 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.399
 easy to use this screen 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.250
 samsung puts several technologies 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 embarked one of them is sp 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.960
 This pen where I can take it gets 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.670
 in the product usually the people who have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 to adapt to the mobile 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 but in this case it is the cell phone that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.949
 Then you can adapt all the writing that I 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 I can do it, I can do it with mine. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.780
 letter and he will understand my letter 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 Another nice thing is that this is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.140
 time I can use it as a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 mouse then if I go there in my 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.850
 gallery and you want to select any 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 type of image or you want to pay 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.770
 usually safe to people image 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.509
 here the second button on the pen and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.259
 I can select all of them from a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 turn 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 the camera is something we're looking for 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 much just thinking about it today. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 samsung has brought a 3.7 camera 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 megapixels with panoramic self 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.740
 When are we going to take a self? 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 usually I have an opening up 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 70 degrees 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.579
 when we talk about panoramic self 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.590
 I have up to 120 degrees or that one 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.570
 background that never appears in the photo or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.770
 that grabs grabs to take a photo 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.439
 people no longer have this problem 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 everyone appears in the picture and the background 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.790
 also appears in a very nice way 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 not to mention that the rear camera is a 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.670
 16-megapixel camera that features 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.700
 several sensors between them the rs a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.070
 image stabilization sensor without 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.659
 smart modes such as 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.399
 example the selective focus where I can 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.280
 hit that first and second photo 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.649
 plan without any problem when we talk 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.819
 we do not talk about photos but 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.990
 also filming 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.720
 today the galaxy 24 film 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.880
 in four cars four times full hd 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.490
 the best resolution available today for 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 the filming of cameras and for those who want 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.610
 stay connected all the time and has no 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.070
 time to lose 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 the galaxy note 4 in addition to the 4g has a 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.710
 download accelerator where I can 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.900
 make the union of my 4g with my efe 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.580
 making my downloads very fast 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.460
 another detail that I liked very much in 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.840
 galaxy note 4 is his drums 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.880
 is a very strong battery also 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 3,220 milan loses battery but it's not only 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.560
 this too loads too fast 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.810
 ie when you get home on the drums 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.300
 If you have weak just put it on the charger 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.340
 around 30 minutes or so already 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.420
 I'll have 50% battery 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.120
 This is something that does a lot 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.050
 difference another good thing is 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.450
 you generate 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.970
 the product of the family the ego where I 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.040
 I have a nice design but the cool one is 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.380
 the connectivity between the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.810
 product here I can answer calls 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.640
 here I can make calls without 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040
 tell me that I can put a chip 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.990
 here and forward the calls from my 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.490
 Apparatus for my seeing is in case I 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.380
