I'm going to do a video on how to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.540 
I'm going to do a video on how to
accelerate<00:00:08.639> up<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.150> hill<00:00:09.420> from<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.469> stop<00:00:10.889> without

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
accelerate up a hill from a stop without

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.480 
accelerate up a hill from a stop without
rolling<00:00:11.969> back<00:00:12.360> there<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.920> member<00:00:14.309> on

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

video and so hopefully i can share

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
video and so hopefully i can share
something<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.420> I've<00:00:21.539> learned<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:21.990> riding

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
something that I've learned about riding

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.300 
something that I've learned about riding
up<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> hill<00:00:23.600> so<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.619> assume<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.220> I'm

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
up a hill so if we assume that I'm

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.939 
up a hill so if we assume that I'm
stopped<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> stoplight<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.630> stop<00:00:28.109> sign<00:00:28.410> what

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
stopped at a stoplight or stop sign what

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
stopped at a stoplight or stop sign what
have<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:30.300> going<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.810> an<00:00:30.929> end<00:00:31.050> con<00:00:32.270> what<00:00:33.270> I

stopped I keep my bike in first gear and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
stopped I keep my bike in first gear and
instead<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:41.190> my<00:00:41.370> front<00:00:41.760> brake<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.930> keep

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
instead of using my front brake to keep

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.799 
instead of using my front brake to keep
myself<00:00:43.320> stationary<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> hill<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.969> use<00:00:45.539> my

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
myself stationary on the hill I use my

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
myself stationary on the hill I use my
foot<00:00:46.050> brake<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.219> foot<00:00:47.399> brake

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
foot brake so I have my foot brake

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.810 
foot brake so I have my foot brake
depressed<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> remain<00:00:49.860> stationary<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
depressed so that I remain stationary on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
depressed so that I remain stationary on
the<00:00:50.940> hill<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.170> order<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> take<00:00:52.860> off

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the hill now in order to take off

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
the hill now in order to take off
without<00:00:53.699> rolling<00:00:54.090> back<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
without rolling back if I get off the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619 
without rolling back if I get off the
foot<00:00:55.559> brake<00:00:55.739> I'll<00:00:56.010> start<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> roll<00:00:56.699> back<00:00:56.730> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
foot brake I'll start to roll back so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
foot brake I'll start to roll back so
instead<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> doing<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:59.399> I'll<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.670> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
instead of doing that what I'll do is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.389 
instead of doing that what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:59.910> keep<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.390> foot<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.469> foot<00:01:01.649> brake<00:01:01.859> keep

I'll keep my foot on the foot brake keep
the<00:01:02.489> foot<00:01:02.640> brake<00:01:02.789> depressed<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the foot brake depressed so that I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.130 
the foot brake depressed so that I
remain<00:01:03.870> still<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:05.450> begin<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> release<00:01:06.900> my

clutch<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
clutch so that I can get out into the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
clutch so that I can get out into the
friction<00:01:09.030> zone<00:01:09.210> give<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.380> bit

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
friction zone give my back a little bit

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
friction zone give my back a little bit
of<00:01:10.680> gas<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> begin<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> feel<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.510> pulling

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of gas when I begin to feel it pulling

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.899 
of gas when I begin to feel it pulling
forward<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.950> let<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> foot<00:01:14.700> brake

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
forward then I let off of the foot brake

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
forward then I let off of the foot brake
alright<00:01:15.810> again<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.229> come<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> stop<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.130> use<00:01:17.520> my
