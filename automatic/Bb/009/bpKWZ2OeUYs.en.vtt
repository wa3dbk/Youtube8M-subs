portion of your metal L bracket will be
very<00:02:33.490> very<00:02:33.760> sharp<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> recommend<00:02:34.870> taking

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
very very sharp so I recommend taking

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.830 
very very sharp so I recommend taking
electrical<00:02:36.040> tape<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.450> covering<00:02:37.450> open<00:02:37.720> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
electrical tape and covering open that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.660 
electrical tape and covering open that
over<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.350> I'll<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:38.710> take<00:02:39.070> off<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.430> sharp

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
over and I'll just take off the sharp

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.120 
over and I'll just take off the sharp
edges<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.200> make<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.350> look<00:02:41.500> nice<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:41.860> black

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
edges and make it look nice and black

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.830

actually getting your camera onto this
apparatus<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.470> here's<00:03:44.709> what<00:03:44.830> you're<00:03:44.950> going<00:03:45.070> to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
apparatus so here's what you're going to

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
apparatus so here's what you're going to
do<00:03:45.459> when<00:03:45.760> we're<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> put<00:03:46.180> your<00:03:46.270> camera<00:03:46.600> on<00:03:46.660> the

do when we're a put your camera on the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.750 
do when we're a put your camera on the
rig<00:03:47.080> you're<00:03:47.320> going<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.739> loosen<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.160> top<00:03:48.400> nut

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
rig you're going to loosen the top nut

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.090 
rig you're going to loosen the top nut
so<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> entire<00:03:49.510> bolt<00:03:49.989> can<00:03:50.350> spin<00:03:50.650> freely

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
so that the entire bolt can spin freely

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.040 
so that the entire bolt can spin freely
they'll<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:52.120> able<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.300> lower<00:03:52.540> your<00:03:52.690> camera

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
they'll be able to lower your camera

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.310 
they'll be able to lower your camera
down<00:03:53.080> so<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.340> tripod<00:03:55.000> acceptor<00:03:55.630> on<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
down so that the tripod acceptor on the

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.500 
down so that the tripod acceptor on the
bottom<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.680> your<00:03:56.739> camera<00:03:57.070> fits<00:03:57.610> over<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:58.120> top

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
bottom of your camera fits over the top

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.560 
bottom of your camera fits over the top
of<00:03:58.540> their<00:03:58.959> bolt<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.910> you're<00:04:00.910> going<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.180> spin

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
of their bolt and you're going to spin

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.660 
of their bolt and you're going to spin
the<00:04:01.660> bolt<00:04:01.900> up<00:04:02.350> into<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.890> camera<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.280> tighten

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
the bolt up into the camera and tighten

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.729 
the bolt up into the camera and tighten
it<00:04:03.700> down<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.870> actually<00:04:05.230> show<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.500> this

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
