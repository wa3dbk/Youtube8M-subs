what did we think of north of 606 again

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.840 
what did we think of north of 606 again
I<00:04:55.050> usually<00:04:55.470> say<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.550> time<00:04:56.669> when<00:04:56.790> I

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
I usually say this all the time when I

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.290 
I usually say this all the time when I
start<00:04:57.090> out<00:04:57.210> great<00:04:57.780> chapter<00:04:58.550> but<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.760> kind<00:05:00.180> of

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
start out great chapter but I kind of

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.180 
start out great chapter but I kind of
wish<00:05:00.510> if<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.229> had<00:05:01.380> one<00:05:01.590> complaint<00:05:01.710> about<00:05:01.979> this

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
wish if I had one complaint about this

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.010 
wish if I had one complaint about this
chapter<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.729> kind<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.240> wish<00:05:03.419> we<00:05:03.450> got<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.720> little

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
chapter I kind of wish we got a little

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.290 
chapter I kind of wish we got a little
bit<00:05:04.139> more<00:05:04.350> into<00:05:04.710> what<00:05:05.520> happened<00:05:05.820> with<00:05:05.940> Kakashi

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
bit more into what happened with Kakashi

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.300 
bit more into what happened with Kakashi
and<00:05:06.540> Ren<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.350> what<00:05:07.530> was<00:05:07.650> going<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.979> there

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
and Ren like what was going on there

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.550 
and Ren like what was going on there
what<00:05:08.820> actually<00:05:09.210> happened<00:05:09.510> with<00:05:09.600> Ren<00:05:09.810> maybe

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
what actually happened with Ren maybe

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.130 
what actually happened with Ren maybe
again<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.520> is<00:05:11.669> my<00:05:11.820> theory<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.540> though

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
again this is my theory that though

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.719 
again this is my theory that though
exposed<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.890> written<00:05:14.130> was<00:05:14.220> actually<00:05:14.520> kind

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
exposed that written was actually kind

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.460 
exposed that written was actually kind
of<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.850> bad<00:05:15.060> guy<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.630> this<00:05:15.780> will<00:05:15.930> make<00:05:16.050> Obito

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
of a bad guy and this will make Obito

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.170 
of a bad guy and this will make Obito
turned<00:05:16.800> back<00:05:16.979> into<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.280> good<00:05:17.550> guy<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:18.030> they'll

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
turned back into a good guy and they'll

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.240 
turned back into a good guy and they'll
all<00:05:18.270> fight<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.660> dog<00:05:18.810> together<00:05:19.080> that's<00:05:20.070> my

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
all fight the dog together that's my

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.900 
all fight the dog together that's my
theory

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
theory

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.880 
theory
cuz<00:05:21.390> it's<00:05:21.570> shown<00:05:21.750> in<00:05:21.780> and<00:05:22.169> everyone<00:05:22.500> works<00:05:22.710> out

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
cuz it's shown in and everyone works out

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.360 
cuz it's shown in and everyone works out
the<00:05:23.039> power<00:05:23.250> friendship<00:05:23.729> always<00:05:23.970> wins<00:05:24.510> always

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
the power friendship always wins always

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.770 
the power friendship always wins always
it's<00:05:26.370> like<00:05:26.520> a<00:05:26.550> rigged<00:05:27.360> game<00:05:27.600> of

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
it's like a rigged game of

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.240 
it's like a rigged game of
rock-paper-scissors<00:05:27.990> where<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:28.950> power<00:05:29.130> of

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
rock-paper-scissors where the power of

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.159 
rock-paper-scissors where the power of
friendship<00:05:29.520> works<00:05:30.000> further<00:05:30.330> than<00:05:30.510> Kakashi<00:05:30.870> no

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
friendship works further than Kakashi no

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.270 
friendship works further than Kakashi no
veto<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:31.650> still<00:05:31.860> be<00:05:31.979> hanging<00:05:32.280> out<00:05:32.660> I<00:05:34.280> think

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
veto it's still be hanging out I think

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.159 
veto it's still be hanging out I think
this<00:05:35.400> is<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> really<00:05:35.820> good<00:05:35.940> chapter<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:36.960> one

put<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:22.860> little<00:06:23.129> too<00:06:23.280> much<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.639> first

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
put a little too much of the first

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.119 
put a little too much of the first
hokage<00:06:24.000> in<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:24.750> fight<00:06:24.930> yeah<00:06:25.349> exactly

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129

still<00:06:26.900> there's<00:06:27.900> some<00:06:28.080> other<00:06:28.259> little<00:06:28.620> things<00:06:28.889> a

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
still there's some other little things a

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.070 
still there's some other little things a
lot<00:06:29.250> of<00:06:29.370> little<00:06:29.669> stuff<00:06:29.849> first<00:06:30.569> and<00:06:30.720> foremost

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
lot of little stuff first and foremost

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.450 
lot of little stuff first and foremost
remember<00:06:31.349> when<00:06:31.440> they're<00:06:31.560> shown<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:31.889> get<00:06:32.039> Amazo

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
remember when they're shown to get Amazo

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.129 
remember when they're shown to get Amazo
and<00:06:32.550> they<00:06:32.610> had<00:06:32.789> the<00:06:32.909> the<00:06:33.300> black<00:06:33.509> roots<00:06:33.840> coming

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
and they had the the black roots coming

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.320 
and they had the the black roots coming
out<00:06:34.349> of<00:06:34.470> it<00:06:34.560> it<00:06:35.190> hasn't<00:06:35.460> been<00:06:35.699> confirmed<00:06:35.940> or

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
out of it it hasn't been confirmed or

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.700 
out of it it hasn't been confirmed or
anything<00:06:36.509> but<00:06:36.810> I'm<00:06:36.930> guessing<00:06:37.409> that<00:06:37.500> these

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
anything but I'm guessing that these

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.559 
anything but I'm guessing that these
black<00:06:37.949> roots<00:06:38.219> are<00:06:38.430> actually<00:06:38.550> those<00:06:38.969> things

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
black roots are actually those things

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.290 
black roots are actually those things
that<00:06:39.750> Payne<00:06:39.960> was<00:06:40.169> using<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.590> chocolate<00:06:40.830> rocks

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
that Payne was using the chocolate rocks

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.399 
that Payne was using the chocolate rocks
maybe<00:06:42.300> that's<00:06:42.569> how<00:06:42.690> there's<00:06:42.870> sort<00:06:43.139> of<00:06:43.229> you

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
maybe that's how there's sort of you

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:44.719 
maybe that's how there's sort of you
know<00:06:43.469> connecting<00:06:44.190> everything<00:06:44.430> and<00:06:44.639> it<00:06:44.699> makes

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
know connecting everything and it makes

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.820 
know connecting everything and it makes
sense<00:06:45.030> because<00:06:45.210> when<00:06:46.199> we've<00:06:46.319> seen<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.650> ghetto

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
sense because when we've seen the ghetto

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.680 
sense because when we've seen the ghetto

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
version I didn't even notice that at

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.439 
version I didn't even notice that at
first<00:07:05.580> when<00:07:05.699> I<00:07:05.729> was<00:07:05.819> reading<00:07:05.969> the<00:07:06.180> manga<00:07:06.300> but

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
first when I was reading the manga but

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.059 
first when I was reading the manga but
he's<00:07:06.599> just<00:07:06.690> like<00:07:06.780> walking<00:07:07.259> through<00:07:07.289> Kakashi<00:07:07.800> I
