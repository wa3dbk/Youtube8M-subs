the program which helps them become
better<00:01:08.290> coaches<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:09.280> they're<00:01:09.520> getting

standard not all programs do you have to

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.219 
standard not all programs do you have to
actually<00:01:23.740> go<00:01:24.130> through<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.399> panel<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.990> that's

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
actually go through a panel and that's

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.380 
actually go through a panel and that's
one<00:01:26.619> thing<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:26.950> has<00:01:27.399> held<00:01:27.729> true<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:28.360> the

everybody<00:01:31.780> has<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.020> coach<00:01:32.380> someone<00:01:32.770> they've

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
everybody has to coach someone they've

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.249 
everybody has to coach someone they've
never<00:01:33.310> met<00:01:33.850> before<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.450> front<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.049> panel

that's<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.649> high<00:01:35.830> standard<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.869> third

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
that's a high standard and the third

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080 
that's a high standard and the third
thing<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.410> guess<00:01:38.619> would<00:01:38.830> be<00:01:38.890> just<00:01:39.340> that<00:01:39.520> applied

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
thing I guess would be just that applied

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.359 
thing I guess would be just that applied
learning<00:01:40.899> there<00:01:41.350> you're<00:01:41.649> out<00:01:41.860> there<00:01:42.100> not<00:01:42.310> just

learning there you're out there not just

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.460 
learning there you're out there not just
learning<00:01:43.030> about<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.420> but<00:01:43.600> you're<00:01:43.750> applying<00:01:44.200> it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
learning about it but you're applying it

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.990 
learning about it but you're applying it
you're<00:01:45.009> finding<00:01:45.690> clients<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:47.110> you're<00:01:48.100> you're

where it really matters you know the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.029 
where it really matters you know the

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
model we use etc etc then they have a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.460 
model we use etc etc then they have a
distance<00:02:37.860> learning<00:02:38.190> component<00:02:38.849> for<00:02:39.569> 24<00:02:40.290> weeks

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
distance learning component for 24 weeks

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.740 
distance learning component for 24 weeks
and<00:02:40.799> at<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.519> end<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.879> that<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.269> come<00:02:42.540> back

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and at the end of that they come back

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.670 
and at the end of that they come back
again<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:44.060> face-to-face<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.599> work<00:02:46.470> together

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
again in face-to-face and work together

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.600 
again in face-to-face and work together
then<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.319> think<00:02:52.709> they're<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.280> come

long time and and so I would say you
pick<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> cohort<00:03:19.019> model

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
pick it because of the cohort model

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.349 
pick it because of the cohort model
because<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.859> go<00:03:20.069> through<00:03:20.430> together<00:03:20.940> with

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
because you go through together with

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.660 
because you go through together with
people<00:03:21.750> because<00:03:22.410> your<00:03:22.769> face<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.130> face<00:03:23.370> you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
people because your face to face you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.449 
people because your face to face you
connect<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.329> different<00:03:24.630> way<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> because

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
connect in a different way and because

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
connect in a different way and because
you<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.880> work<00:03:27.120> at<00:03:27.269> home<00:03:27.299> afterwards<00:03:28.260> so

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
you get to work at home afterwards so

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.440 
you get to work at home afterwards so
for<00:03:28.680> seven<00:03:28.950> months<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.579> can<00:03:29.880> still<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.299> back

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
for seven months it can still go back

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.569 
for seven months it can still go back
into<00:03:30.660> your<00:03:30.870> own<00:03:30.989> fit<00:03:31.980> into<00:03:32.130> your<00:03:32.220> own<00:03:32.400> life

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
into your own fit into your own life

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.879 
into your own fit into your own life
somehow<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.319> has<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> best<00:03:34.680> of

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
somehow so I think it has the best of

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.979 
somehow so I think it has the best of
all<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> worlds<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.389> you're<00:03:36.840> gonna

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
all the worlds in that and you're gonna

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.970 
all the worlds in that and you're gonna
play<00:03:37.680> with<00:03:38.099> world-class<00:03:38.609> coaches<00:03:39.389> and<00:03:39.980> learn

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
play with world-class coaches and learn

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.599 
play with world-class coaches and learn
with<00:03:41.250> them<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.670> from<00:03:41.880> them<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:43.609> if

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
with them and from them and and if

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.890 
with them and from them and and if
that's<00:03:44.790> what<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.030> looking<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.329> learn<00:03:45.540> is

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that's what you're looking to learn is

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.259 
that's what you're looking to learn is
how<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.099> best<00:03:47.130> coach<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.760> think<00:03:48.000> that's

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
how to be the best coach I think that's

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.080 
how to be the best coach I think that's
what<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.049> where<00:03:49.200> you're<00:03:49.319> learning<00:03:50.090> this
