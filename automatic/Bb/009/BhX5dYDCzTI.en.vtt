00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.950
 today's apple event 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.160

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.290

 cook took the stage and like 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.369
 in all the apple events started to 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.970
 talk about the incredible sales of the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 company and its achievements worldwide 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 but this time I will not bore you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.029
 mentioning these achievements since during 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 this event were presented quite 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.890
 products and I do not want to make this video 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 very long so let's enter fully 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 the products that were presented on 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.080
 first was the new macbook pro of 13 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.869
 inches with retina display version 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 most economical of this new computer 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:52.320
 It will cost 699 thousand dollars and come with a 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.799
 2.5-core a5 processor to 2.5 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.989
 gigahertz 8 gigabytes in ram 7 hours 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.320
 battery life and a flash memory 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.629
 128 gigabytes apart from obviously 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.089
 count on the impressive retina 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.250
 display 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.520
 the next product that was submitted 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.200
 it was the new generation of mac mini the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.219
 entry price for this device 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.009
 will be only $ 599 and will come 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:22.789
 with a dual-core a5 processor to 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.780
 2.5 gigahertz 4 gigabytes in ram and a 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.520
 500 gigabyte hard drive later came 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.799
 one of the biggest surprises of the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.409
 event although not the biggest since my 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.840
 point of view the new one was presented 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.329
 generation of imac which simply 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.659
 impressed the audience because of its 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.899
 incredibly thin display only 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.640
 5 millimeters thick this is 80 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.610
 100 percent thinner than his generation 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.590
 previous though obviously because of this 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.649
 the new ayman no longer include a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.590
 disc reader but honestly already 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.179
 who uses that apart from his awesome 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.250
 new screen 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.250
 ayman also include a so-called fusion 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.110
 drive which as explained apple is a 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.329
 hard drive that combines the best of the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.890
 flash memory with the best of the discs 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.170
 hard we know today 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.620
 the entry price for this new 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.930
 imac will be 1,200 99 dollars and will come 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.290
 with a quad-core processor and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 five to 2.7 giga hertz 8 gigabytes in 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.840
 ram a geforce gt 640 m and a terabyte 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 in storage capacity 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
 and then came what for me was the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.849
 great surprise of the event and no no I 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.530
 I mean the iPad mini I do not think anyone 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.080
 I would have expected to see the next 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.780
 generation of the ipad in this event but 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.330
 that's how it was and although they did not talk much about 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.540
 she the most important change is in her 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.670
 new processor a6 x which is two 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.849
 times faster than the new ipad 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 that now is the old ipad better 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.220
 let's call ipad third generation 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.319
 this fourth generation of the ipad also 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.849
 includes the new lightning connector and 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.380
 retains most of them 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.140
 characteristics of his generation 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.829
 previous only that as I mentioned before 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.660
 with a processor twice as fast 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.579
 no doubt this update will not fall 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.860
 does not suit the owners of ipads of 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.310
 third generation which came out at 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.110
 market just six months ago as soon as 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.239
 at the price of this new generation of 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.560
 ipad stays exactly the same as 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.110
 before starting at $ 499 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.950
 and to finish the event was presented what 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.739
 that everyone was waiting for the ipad mini 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.319
 its screen is 7.9 inches its 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.900
 processors in 5 has a time 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.450
 life in the 10-hour battery account 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.510
 with a 5 megapixel isight camera 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.819
 supports lte speeds and obviously 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.220
 has the new lightning connector 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.650
 of support in terms of your screen 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.840
 has retina display in fact its 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.690
 resolution is exactly the same as 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.819
 that of ipad 2 after they were made 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.970
 enough comparisons between the ipad 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.250
 mini and Annex 7 and how are we in a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.709
 support event obviously made see 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.349
 to Annex 7 as the worst invention of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.419
 man to this day though to be able 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.729
 make a fair comparison we will have 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.880
 than waiting to put them face to face and the 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.740
 Entry price of the iPad mini is 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.870
 329 dollars 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.759
 and basically this was all that 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.070
 happened in the apple event of the day of 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.320
