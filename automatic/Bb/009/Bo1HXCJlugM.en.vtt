car company will have a plug-in hybrid
electric<00:04:04.760> vehicle<00:04:05.480> eventually<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.170> that's

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
electric vehicle eventually and that's

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.319 
electric vehicle eventually and that's
maybe<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.739> five<00:04:06.950> or<00:04:06.980> six<00:04:07.310> or<00:04:07.430> seven<00:04:07.730> years<00:04:07.760> down

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329
