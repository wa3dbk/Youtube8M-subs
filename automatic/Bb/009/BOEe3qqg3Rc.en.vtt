00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
a bad night my amp has a little

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.199 
a bad night my amp has a little
equalizer<00:00:08.770> built<00:00:09.100> into<00:00:09.340> this<00:00:09.490> so<00:00:10.000> it's<00:00:10.120> not

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
equalizer built into this so it's not

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.400 
equalizer built into this so it's not
like<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.420> normal<00:00:10.510> acoustic<00:00:11.080> with<00:00:11.200> just<00:00:11.350> a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
like a normal acoustic with just a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.959 
like a normal acoustic with just a
normal<00:00:11.559> plugging<00:00:11.980> I<00:00:12.160> have<00:00:12.759> a<00:00:12.790> bit<00:00:12.940> of

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
normal plugging I have a bit of

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.669 
normal plugging I have a bit of
depolarization<00:00:13.599> of<00:00:14.049> how<00:00:14.200> it<00:00:14.349> goes<00:00:14.530> on<00:00:14.559> the

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
depolarization of how it goes on the

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.800 
depolarization of how it goes on the
battery<00:00:15.040> so<00:00:15.730> that's<00:00:16.270> where<00:00:16.450> we're<00:00:16.570> trying<00:00:16.689> to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
battery so that's where we're trying to

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:34.220 
battery so that's where we're trying to
figure<00:00:16.990> out<00:00:17.110> is<00:00:17.349> it<00:00:17.470> s<00:00:17.619> done

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.189

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
if you know that when she does make my

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
people can you try that on the use of us

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:50.299 
people can you try that on the use of us
class<00:00:42.130> one

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.889 

it's<00:00:51.309> not<00:00:51.489> as<00:00:51.640> much<00:00:51.820> right<00:00:52.120> right<00:00:52.570> try<00:00:52.839> the

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
it's not as much right right try the

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.340 
it's not as much right right try the
tabletop<00:00:53.550> itself<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.760> closed

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350
