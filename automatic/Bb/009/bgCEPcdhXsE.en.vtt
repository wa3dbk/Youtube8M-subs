been<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.869> film<00:01:28.320> buff<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.850> old

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
been a film buff but not these old

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
been a film buff but not these old
classics<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:32.159> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
classics because you know now when you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.499 
classics because you know now when you
actually<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> reasons<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
actually that's one of the reasons this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually that's one of the reasons this
film<00:01:33.750> should<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.079> been<00:01:34.259> made<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> believe

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619

intellectual filmmaker and say oh what
beauty<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> normal<00:01:46.350> audience

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
beauty but I know for a normal audience

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.190 
beauty but I know for a normal audience
they<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.189> things<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.570> today<00:01:48.720> we

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
they like things to be now and today we

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.070 
they like things to be now and today we
need<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> adapt<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.460> there<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.759> go

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
need to adapt it and there we go

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.810 
need to adapt it and there we go
and<00:01:51.170> temporally<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.220> was<00:01:52.370> important<00:01:52.790> to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and temporally so it was important to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.330 
and temporally so it was important to
film<00:01:53.060> like<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:53.620> should<00:01:54.620> be<00:01:54.770> made<00:01:54.980> so<00:01:55.310> that

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
film like this should be made so that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.950 
film like this should be made so that
people<00:01:55.460> are<00:01:55.790> introduced<00:01:56.120> to<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.390> classics<00:01:56.810> of

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
her country and Devdas is perhaps the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.020 
her country and Devdas is perhaps the
classic<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.440> our<00:02:00.560> country<00:02:00.830> so<00:02:01.490> there<00:02:01.790> was<00:02:01.910> one

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
are not good let's eat and I think our

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.009 
are not good let's eat and I think our
approaches<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:08.150> all<00:03:08.269> about<00:03:08.450> your<00:03:08.660> approach

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
approaches it's all about your approach

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.600 
approaches it's all about your approach
and<00:03:09.230> your<00:03:09.350> mindset<00:03:09.650> idea<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.430> way<00:03:10.459> you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
and your mindset idea but the way you

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.340 
and your mindset idea but the way you
choose<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.940> be<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.570> mean<00:03:12.050> if<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.320> believe

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
choose to be I mean if you believe

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.800 
choose to be I mean if you believe
you're<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:12.980> you're<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.370> demigod<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
you're it you're a demigod that's the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.770 
you're it you're a demigod that's the
beginning<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> end

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
beginning of the end

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.340 
beginning of the end
I<00:03:15.810> think<00:03:16.170> most<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.620> us<00:03:16.800> are<00:03:17.010> art<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.350> we

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
I think most of us are art like that we

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.530 
I think most of us are art like that we
are<00:03:19.709> quite<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> touch<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.400> reality<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.060> I

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
are quite a touch with reality and I

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.120 
are quite a touch with reality and I
think<00:03:22.020> that's<00:03:22.170> being<00:03:22.410> intrinsically<00:03:22.590> India

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
think that's being intrinsically India

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.570 
think that's being intrinsically India
there<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.940> very<00:03:23.970> basic<00:03:24.600> very<00:03:24.959> basic<00:03:25.580> there

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
there is a very basic very basic there

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.300 
there is a very basic very basic there
is<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> simple<00:03:27.120> simplicity<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.900> our<00:03:28.140> films<00:03:28.470> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
is a simple simplicity to our films to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.070 
is a simple simplicity to our films to
