00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.099
 this is a fucking mobile broken then 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.130
 I'll fix a good whack on a trip to new 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:22.090
 york said he moves to new york over here 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.579
 is new and the camera is all 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.590
 hesperia to the set to 2 chema there is no more 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.680
 I'm going to portray new york with a god 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.460
 until it took to teach what 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.460
 so that approach 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.460
 focus there 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.379
 this is a floor kick 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.780
 I know it seems impossible but it's true 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.390
 so if we look at what we can 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 block by hitting the button this but it puts 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.380
 slide to unlock and how 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.200
 you will check 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.480
 it does not work 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.180
 does not work the touch has stopped 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.460
 work then I'm going to I'm going to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.770
 solve this problem when this happens 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.600
 if you want to solve what is power 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.160
 recover your data and everything before 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.080
 take the mobile to fix or any 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.740
 thing what we have to do is 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 buy this cable this micro cable 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 which is on the one hand 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 male microusb that gets in there and by the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.759
 another side female usb that is to poke 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 the usb this cable as you can 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 find online for two euros like this 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.009
 but of course it takes seven days to arrive and 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.869
 If you want to buy it instantly, it is 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.450
 mean more same for seven euros what 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.909
 you can also find then this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.140
 The tab is open 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.300
 micro usb gets into the micro usb 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.460
 logically 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.340
 and here we can connect of all we can 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.010
 connect a keyboard we can connect usb 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.010
 we can connect another that has more 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.170
 usb is the hit and can connect several 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.140
 things at once then now how are you going 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.390
 let's see we take a mouse hp mouse that does not 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.600
 It's from the Chinese 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.700
 and we connect it here so that according and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.370
 now with this the screen turns on 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 the mouse works and now I want it 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.200
 see that I move the mouse 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.380
 again mouse and mouse moves it 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.870
 you see 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.750
 is how it is then we can already use 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.210
 the mobile without the touch 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.570
 we slide fixed as we can do 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.820
 that work by looking at the sides and 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.380
 works perfectly then already 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.720
 we can recover all our data 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.240
 because if we connect the mobile to 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.920
 computer without putting the pin or if it is 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.540
 the mobile off and we want to recover 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.280
 data and mobile off is not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.960
 let's be able the computer is going to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.240
 recognize the mobile but it will come out 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.950
 completely empty then you would have to 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.050
 put the pin but of course if the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.060
 touch that in this case does not go to a 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.820
 shit I could not then I had to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.520
 connect the mouse put the pin so that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.340
 the mobile got in and once inside 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.140
 You can now recover all my data 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.630
 well that's what I said to the mobile this 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.460
 we can connect it mouse keyboards 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.320
 we can put usb is also so that 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.460
 recognize them and read them on the mobile 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.550
 both songs movies and others and that 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.860
 it's all so nothing 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.860
 said and done given the quality 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.870
 Y
