00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
future to once I got some more games

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.029 
future to once I got some more games
under<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.930> belt<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.529> my<00:00:19.619> initial

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
under my belt these are my initial

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.759 
under my belt these are my initial
impressions<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> what<00:00:20.789> i<00:00:20.910> think<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> demo

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
impressions of what i think of the demo

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.050 
impressions of what i think of the demo
obviously<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> demo<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.220> something<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.029> take

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
obviously the demo is something to take

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.939 
obviously the demo is something to take
of<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> grain<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.630> salt<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
of a grain of salt because this is the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
of a grain of salt because this is the
kind<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.730> working<00:00:27.330> ground<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.050> changes

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
kind of working ground for some changes

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.689 
kind of working ground for some changes
that<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.560> will<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.160> tweak<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that they will make they will tweak the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
that they will make they will tweak the
game<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> bit<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.720> might<00:00:31.109> remember<00:00:31.260> from

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
game a bit as you might remember from

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
game a bit as you might remember from
NHL<00:00:31.949> 13<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.489> game<00:00:32.669> did<00:00:32.910> change<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.690> bit<00:00:33.840> when

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
NHL 13 the game did change a bit when

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.479 
NHL 13 the game did change a bit when
you<00:00:34.050> got<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> actual<00:00:34.680> final<00:00:34.950> release<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
you got to the actual final release of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
you got to the actual final release of
the<00:00:35.610> game<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.050> an<00:00:37.140> idea

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the game but it's a good kind of an idea

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
the game but it's a good kind of an idea
of<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> game's<00:00:38.340> gonna<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.850> coming

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
of what the game's gonna be like coming

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.430 
of what the game's gonna be like coming
at<00:00:39.239> release<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.809> biggest<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
at release and the biggest thing that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
at release and the biggest thing that
came<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.520> mind<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.090> i<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> playing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
came right to mind when i was playing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
came right to mind when i was playing
this<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.410> hitting<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.040> completely

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
this is the hitting is completely

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.979 
this is the hitting is completely
changed<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.149> least<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> field<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> hitting

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
changed or at least the field of hitting

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
changed or at least the field of hitting
is<00:00:46.079> completely<00:00:46.500> changed<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> skating<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
is completely changed the skating is a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
is completely changed the skating is a
little<00:00:48.210> bit<00:00:48.329> janky<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> demo<00:00:49.050> lease<00:00:49.350> but

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
little bit janky in this demo lease but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.080 
little bit janky in this demo lease but
i<00:00:49.680> could<00:00:49.980> definitely<00:00:50.129> feel<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> hitting

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
i could definitely feel that the hitting

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.639 
i could definitely feel that the hitting
was<00:00:51.239> way<00:00:51.449> different<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.559> gonna

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
was way different here and you're gonna

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
was way different here and you're gonna
see<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:52.920> big<00:00:53.250> hits<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:54.000> least<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.660> bit

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
see some big hits at least a little bit

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.029 
see some big hits at least a little bit
later<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.140> where<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.440> start<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> little

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
later on where i start getting a little

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
later on where i start getting a little
bit<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.370> comfortable<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> system<00:00:57.449> now

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bit more comfortable the system now

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
bit more comfortable the system now
that's<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.320> actually<00:00:58.590> i'm<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.070> liking<00:00:59.219> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that's not actually i'm really liking so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
that's not actually i'm really liking so
far<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:01.020> probably

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
far is it you can see that was probably

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
far is it you can see that was probably
the<00:01:01.410> biggest<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.670> couple<00:01:02.820> hits

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the biggest one there and a couple hits

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
the biggest one there and a couple hits

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
on the boards there to where you could

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
on the boards there to where you could
just<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> yes<00:01:06.210> i<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
play but wasn't really expecting that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.080 
play but wasn't really expecting that
hit<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.630> much<00:01:12.840> punch<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> did<00:01:13.770> and

here<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.130> gives<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.369> an<00:01:23.430> idea<00:01:23.490> too

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here but it kind gives you an idea too

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.820 
here but it kind gives you an idea too
that<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that there's going to be a bit of that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
that there's going to be a bit of that
going<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.310> where<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.790> computers<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.330> going

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
going on where the computers not going

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
going on where the computers not going
to<00:01:27.540> give<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.470> free<00:01:28.920> leeway<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to give you you know free leeway to just

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
to give you you know free leeway to just
go<00:01:30.329> around<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> ice<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.049> hit<00:01:31.320> people<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.829> much

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
go around the ice and hit people as much

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
go around the ice and hit people as much
as<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.610> um<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.659> skating<00:01:34.079> feels<00:01:34.290> very

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
as you want um the skating feels very

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
as you want um the skating feels very
similar<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> angel<00:01:35.490> 13<00:01:35.850> which<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
similar to angel 13 which i think is a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.690 
similar to angel 13 which i think is a
good<00:01:36.509> thing<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.040> angel<00:01:38.369> 13

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
good thing because you know angel 13

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789 
good thing because you know angel 13
gameplay<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.570> skating<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.170> least<00:01:40.350> was<00:01:40.470> pretty

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
gameplay for skating at least was pretty

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.170 
gameplay for skating at least was pretty
solid<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.369> was<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.670> tweaks<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.030> they

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
solid there was some tweaks that they

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
solid there was some tweaks that they
wanted<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
wanted to make and you know one of the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.190 
wanted to make and you know one of the
things<00:01:44.729> i<00:01:44.939> could<00:01:45.000> feel<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> demo<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
things i could feel in this demo was a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
things i could feel in this demo was a
it<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.409> little<00:01:46.590> janky<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.130> times<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.729> know

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it was a little janky at times you know

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
it was a little janky at times you know
there<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.680> kind

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
there was a little bit more of this kind

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
there was a little bit more of this kind
of<00:01:50.070> feeling<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.119> everything<00:01:51.450> wasn't<00:01:51.630> smooth

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
of feeling that everything wasn't smooth

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.090 
of feeling that everything wasn't smooth
and<00:01:52.470> i<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.829> something<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and i think that's something that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.920 
and i think that's something that
they're<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> iron<00:01:54.630> out

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
they're gonna you know kind of iron out

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
they're gonna you know kind of iron out
a<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.200> when<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> comes<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> actual<00:01:56.250> game

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
a bit when it comes to the actual game

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.389 
a bit when it comes to the actual game
coming<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.689> September<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> first

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
coming in at September you see the first

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.499 
coming in at September you see the first
school<00:01:59.549> year<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.790> actually<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.450> one

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
school year and actually I like this one

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
school year and actually I like this one
because<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.170> goes<00:02:01.380> short<00:02:01.590> side<00:02:01.890> there

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
because it just goes short side there

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.639 
because it just goes short side there
and<00:02:02.540> nothing<00:02:03.540> too<00:02:03.810> special<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.200> good<00:02:04.350> goal<00:02:04.500> by

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and nothing too special a good goal by

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.280 
and nothing too special a good goal by
sharp<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.509> they<00:02:06.509> were<00:02:06.540> also<00:02:06.780> talking<00:02:07.020> about

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
sharp but they were also talking about

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.430 
sharp but they were also talking about
that<00:02:07.770> being<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.039> devs<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.060> angel<00:02:09.959> 14<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that being the devs of the angel 14 that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.570 
that being the devs of the angel 14 that
they're<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:10.770> trying<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> make<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
they're really trying to make it so that

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.330 
they're really trying to make it so that
there<00:02:11.730> would<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:11.910> more

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
there would be more

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.190 
there would be more
rules<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.730> are<00:02:12.760> maybe<00:02:13.569> not<00:02:13.690> ones<00:02:14.050> you'd

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
rules that are maybe not ones you'd

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.720 
rules that are maybe not ones you'd
expect<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.650> go<00:02:14.769> in<00:02:14.920> all<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.069> time<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.640> that's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
expect to go in all the time and that's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.250 
expect to go in all the time and that's
nice<00:02:15.940> see<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.300> one<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.629> there<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:16.930> to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
nice see that one going there just to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.759 
nice see that one going there just to
show<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.099> actually<00:02:18.280> can<00:02:18.580> happen<00:02:19.030> to

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
show that that actually can happen to

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.229 
show that that actually can happen to
see<00:02:20.769> how<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> biggest<00:02:21.849> thing<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.030> really

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
see how the biggest thing I really

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.490 
see how the biggest thing I really
enjoyed<00:02:22.510> was<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.840> also<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.230> other<00:02:23.410> thing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
enjoyed was that also the other thing

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.479 
enjoyed was that also the other thing
that<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.739> start<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> get<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> little<00:02:24.250> bit<00:02:24.400> of

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
that I start to get a little bit of

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.240 
that I start to get a little bit of
grips<00:02:24.819> with<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:25.269> this<00:02:25.510> demo<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.290> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
grips with in this demo here is the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.670 
grips with in this demo here is the
actual<00:02:27.400> Deeks<00:02:27.879> feel<00:02:28.269> at<00:02:28.989> least<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.319> me<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> lot

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
actual Deeks feel at least to me a lot

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.229 
actual Deeks feel at least to me a lot
better<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.190> mean<00:02:30.459> they<00:02:30.670> feel<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> little<00:02:31.120> bit

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
better I mean they feel a little bit

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.140 
better I mean they feel a little bit
more<00:02:31.390> fluid<00:02:31.780> than<00:02:31.810> they<00:02:32.019> did<00:02:32.080> before<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
more fluid than they did before and the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.580 
more fluid than they did before and the
thing<00:02:34.599> that<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.840> initially<00:02:35.049> get<00:02:35.349> out<00:02:35.470> of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
thing that you initially get out of

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.710 
thing that you initially get out of
playing<00:02:35.860> again<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.849> M<00:02:36.970> played<00:02:37.330> yet<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
playing again the M played yet is that

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.509 
playing again the M played yet is that
it's<00:02:38.560> hard<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.040> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.459> feeling

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
it's hard to kind of get that feeling

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.979 
it's hard to kind of get that feeling
for<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.180> definitely<00:02:40.390> could<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.690> that

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
for but I definitely could see that

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.039 
for but I definitely could see that
these<00:02:41.170> Deeks<00:02:41.590> are<00:02:41.860> gonna<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.569> open

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
these Deeks are gonna be you know open

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.289 
these Deeks are gonna be you know open
up<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.920> player<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.519> really<00:02:45.790> kind<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.120> get

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
up to the player to really kind of get

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
some big hit so far really trying to

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.759 
some big hit so far really trying to
test<00:04:03.069> the<00:04:03.310> system<00:04:03.730> see<00:04:04.389> how<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.540> goes<00:04:04.769> that

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
test the system see how that goes that

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.860 
test the system see how that goes that
the<00:04:06.310> pentland<00:04:07.060> calling<00:04:07.299> is<00:04:07.359> pretty<00:04:07.630> solid

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870

they're really on the ball for that I've
had<00:04:10.000> some<00:04:10.209> charging<00:04:10.480> pennies<00:04:10.840> where<00:04:11.200> I've

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
had some charging pennies where I've

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.050 
had some charging pennies where I've
said<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.560> myself<00:04:11.859> yet<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.220> was<00:04:12.370> completely<00:04:12.760> a

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
said to myself yet that was completely a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.229 
said to myself yet that was completely a
charge<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.989> didn't<00:04:14.739> deserve<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:15.669> get

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
charge there I didn't deserve to get

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.370 
charge there I didn't deserve to get
away<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.930> didn't<00:04:17.200> get<00:04:17.260> away

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
away with that and I didn't get away

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.020 
away with that and I didn't get away
with<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:17.979> that's<00:04:18.130> nice<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.489> see<00:04:18.700> from<00:04:18.880> not

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
with it and that's nice to see from not

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.899 
with it and that's nice to see from not
there<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.769> high<00:04:20.979> stickings<00:04:21.519> are<00:04:21.700> there

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
there to the high stickings are there

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.670 
there to the high stickings are there
that's<00:04:22.150> something<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:22.510> you'd<00:04:22.719> expect<00:04:23.409> to<00:04:23.530> be

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
that's something that you'd expect to be

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.410 
that's something that you'd expect to be
there<00:04:24.180> but

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
there but

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.390 
there but
no<00:04:25.600> definitely<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.140> could<00:04:26.380> see<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.740> hopefully

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
no definitely I could see that hopefully

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.290 
no definitely I could see that hopefully
you<00:04:27.460> know<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:27.910> something<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.210> I'm

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
you know this is something that I'm

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.610 
you know this is something that I'm
going<00:04:28.390> to<00:04:28.450> get<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.750> impressions<00:04:29.320> video<00:04:29.440> a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
going to get that impressions video a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.710 
going to get that impressions video a
little<00:04:29.920> bit<00:04:30.100> later<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.790> have<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.450> better<00:04:31.630> idea

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
little bit later on I have a better idea

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.350 
little bit later on I have a better idea
of<00:04:32.230> this<00:04:32.380> whole<00:04:32.620> demo<00:04:33.430> what<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.760> think<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.180> so

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
of this whole demo what I think of it so

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.760 
of this whole demo what I think of it so
far<00:04:34.390> these<00:04:34.720> are<00:04:34.900> my<00:04:34.990> initial<00:04:35.380> ones<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.680> I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
far these are my initial ones like I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.860 
far these are my initial ones like I
said<00:04:36.040> but<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.760> seems<00:04:37.000> like<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.480> actual

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
said but it seems like the actual

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.110 
said but it seems like the actual
penalties<00:04:38.260> are<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.530> little<00:04:38.890> bit<00:04:39.100> more<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.670> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
penalties are a little bit more to the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.990 
penalties are a little bit more to the
point<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.480> that's<00:04:40.660> actually<00:04:40.810> really<00:04:41.200> awesome

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
point and that's actually really awesome

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.790 
point and that's actually really awesome
it<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.330> I'm<00:04:43.720> going<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.990> able<00:04:44.140> to<00:04:44.440> play

in<00:05:25.000> arms<00:05:25.150> with<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.450> fact<00:05:25.660> that<00:05:25.720> doesn't<00:05:26.080> look

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
in arms with the fact that doesn't look

massively<00:05:26.710> different<00:05:27.010> than<00:05:27.460> angel<00:05:28.000> 13<00:05:28.450> I

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
massively different than angel 13 I

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.400 
massively different than angel 13 I
don't<00:05:28.660> think<00:05:28.810> that's<00:05:28.930> something<00:05:29.080> need<00:05:29.350> to

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
don't think that's something need to

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.020 
don't think that's something need to
worry<00:05:29.650> about<00:05:29.800> because<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.640> next-gen

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
worry about because the next-gen

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.270 
worry about because the next-gen
consoles<00:05:31.570> coming<00:05:32.350> relatively<00:05:32.800> soon<00:05:33.040> there's

consoles coming relatively soon there's

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.250 
consoles coming relatively soon there's
a<00:05:33.340> deacon<00:05:33.790> a<00:05:33.880> goal<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.360> no<00:05:34.720> one's<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.990> little<00:05:35.080> bit

a deacon a goal I no one's a little bit

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.110
