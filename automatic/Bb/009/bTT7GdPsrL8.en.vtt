00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
two parts two components and depending

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.920 
two parts two components and depending
on<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:45.280> relationship<00:02:45.459> between<00:02:46.450> these<00:02:46.870> two

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
on the relationship between these two

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.030 
on the relationship between these two
components<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.970> humans<00:02:49.540> will<00:02:49.989> find<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.739> sound

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
components we humans will find the sound

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.930 
components we humans will find the sound
easier<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.299> listen<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:53.310> easier<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.489> understand

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
easier to listen to easier to understand

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.750 
easier to listen to easier to understand
and<00:02:55.060> easier<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.989> enjoy<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.680> short<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.640> will

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
and easier to enjoy in short we will

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.670 
and easier to enjoy in short we will
find<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.299> more<00:02:59.230> natural<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.840> two<00:03:02.049> components

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
find it more natural the two components

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.750 
find it more natural the two components
are<00:03:02.910> what<00:03:03.910> we<00:03:04.120> describe<00:03:04.690> as<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.500> direct<00:03:06.010> or

what<00:03:16.140> are<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.320> characteristics<00:03:17.160> or<00:03:17.340> how

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
what are the characteristics or how

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.230 
what are the characteristics or how
would<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.030> recognize<00:03:18.390> these<00:03:18.930> sounds<00:03:19.380> well<00:03:19.590> if

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
would you recognize these sounds well if

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.780 
would you recognize these sounds well if
you<00:03:21.240> imagine<00:03:21.720> yourself<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.920> small<00:03:23.190> closet

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you imagine yourself in a small closet

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.370 
you imagine yourself in a small closet
that<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.450> filled<00:03:24.960> with<00:03:25.230> clothing<00:03:26.420> you're<00:03:27.420> in

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
that is filled with clothing you're in

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.960 
that is filled with clothing you're in
this<00:03:28.650> closet<00:03:28.860> with<00:03:29.220> another<00:03:29.490> person<00:03:29.880> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
this closet with another person and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.420 
this closet with another person and
you're<00:03:30.150> holding<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.540> conversation<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:32.130> sound

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
you're holding a conversation the sound

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.620 
you're holding a conversation the sound
will<00:03:32.640> be<00:03:32.670> very<00:03:33.060> dry<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:35.100> won't<00:03:35.550> have<00:03:36.030> any

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
will be very dry it won't have any

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.830 
will be very dry it won't have any
spaciousness<00:03:38.360> that's<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.870> sound<00:03:40.170> of

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
spaciousness that's the sound of

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.490 
spaciousness that's the sound of
coherent<00:03:42.840> silent<00:03:43.709> that's<00:03:44.040> very<00:03:44.760> direct<00:03:45.500> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
coherent silent that's very direct if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.170 
coherent silent that's very direct if
you<00:03:46.800> imagine<00:03:47.010> yourself<00:03:47.310> at<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> back<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.090> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you imagine yourself at the back of a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.380 
you imagine yourself at the back of a
church<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:49.310> you're<00:03:50.310> listening<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.910> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
church and you're listening to the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.280 
church and you're listening to the
sounds<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.860> hear<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.459> church

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
sounds that you hear in the church

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.790 
sounds that you hear in the church
that's<00:03:55.730> incoherent<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.050> very<00:03:58.050> reflected

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
that's incoherent and very reflected

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.949 
that's incoherent and very reflected
sound<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.310> hard<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.790> tell<00:04:00.030> even<00:04:00.450> where<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
sound it's hard to tell even where the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.390 
sound it's hard to tell even where the
sound<00:04:01.230> comes<00:04:01.530> from<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.700> back<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:02.910> eternity

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
sound comes from at the back of eternity

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.290 
sound comes from at the back of eternity
now<00:04:05.400> if<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.630> could<00:04:06.870> combine<00:04:07.880> those<00:04:08.880> two

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
now if you could combine those two

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.810 
now if you could combine those two
sounds<00:04:10.020> and<00:04:10.820> if<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:11.970> could<00:04:12.180> combine

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
sounds and if you could combine

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.050 
sounds and if you could combine
producing<00:04:14.820> those<00:04:15.390> two<00:04:15.840> sounds<00:04:16.820> then<00:04:17.820> you

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
producing those two sounds then you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.909 
producing those two sounds then you
would<00:04:18.239> have<00:04:18.419> layered<00:04:18.750> sound<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.709> in

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
would have layered sound that that is in

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.280 
would have layered sound that that is in
fact<00:04:20.160> what<00:04:21.030> we<00:04:21.359> have<00:04:21.390> achieved<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:24.300> have<00:04:24.690> the

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
fact what we have achieved we have the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.790 
fact what we have achieved we have the
technology<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.580> methods<00:04:27.590> building<00:04:28.590> and

designing<00:04:29.840> loudspeakers<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.620> audio<00:04:32.190> systems

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
designing loudspeakers and audio systems

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.440 
designing loudspeakers and audio systems
so<00:04:33.300> that<00:04:33.330> we<00:04:33.540> are<00:04:33.930> able<00:04:34.260> to<00:04:35.510> create<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:38.450> create

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
so that we are able to create and create

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.310 
so that we are able to create and create
the<00:04:39.960> sound<00:04:40.260> waves<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:41.130> move<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.880> air<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:43.020> that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the sound waves to move the air so that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.140 
the sound waves to move the air so that
it<00:04:43.979> has<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.880> same<00:04:45.150> characteristics<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:47.150> both

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
it has the same characteristics of both

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.070 
it has the same characteristics of both
of<00:04:48.570> those<00:04:48.840> kinds<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.560> sounds<00:04:50.070> combined<00:04:51.080> into

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
of those kinds of sounds combined into

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.930 
of those kinds of sounds combined into
the<00:04:52.200> same<00:04:52.440> system<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.600> we<00:04:54.600> do<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:55.050> without

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
the same system and we do that without

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.210 
the same system and we do that without
digital<00:04:56.940> signal<00:04:57.570> processing<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.380> without

digital signal processing and without
any<00:04:59.550> other<00:05:00.030> effects<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:01.800> use<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.550> effects

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
any other effects we can use the effects

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.990 
any other effects we can use the effects
to<00:05:03.090> enhance<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.020> make<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.590> even<00:05:05.220> better<00:05:05.400> if

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
to enhance it and make it even better if

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.450 
to enhance it and make it even better if
that<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.830> goal<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:09.330> what<00:05:10.229> we<00:05:10.440> need<00:05:10.800> first

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
that is the goal but what we need first

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.290 
that is the goal but what we need first
and<00:05:11.880> what<00:05:12.300> sound<00:05:12.870> needs<00:05:13.290> is<00:05:14.060> physically<00:05:15.060> in

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
and what sound needs is physically in

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.510 
and what sound needs is physically in
terms<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:15.930> how<00:05:16.229> does<00:05:16.770> it<00:05:16.919> move<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.310> air

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
terms of how does it move the air

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.510 
terms of how does it move the air
and<00:05:18.639> so<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.419> we<00:05:19.599> experience<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.770> physical

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
and so that we experience the physical

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.270 
and so that we experience the physical
characteristic<00:05:22.389> and<00:05:23.229> the<00:05:23.500> patterns<00:05:23.979> in<00:05:24.220> the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
characteristic and the patterns in the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.110 
characteristic and the patterns in the
air<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.870> way<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.169> do<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:26.710> simply<00:05:27.699> and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
air the way to do that simply and

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.689 
air the way to do that simply and
effectively<00:05:28.720> is<00:05:29.409> with<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:30.190> layered<00:05:30.400> sound

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
effectively is with the layered sound

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.070 
effectively is with the layered sound
technology<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.830> that's<00:05:33.250> what<00:05:33.909> we<00:05:34.060> do<00:05:34.210> here<00:05:34.539> at

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
technology and that's what we do here at
