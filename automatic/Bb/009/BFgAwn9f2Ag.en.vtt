absolutely amazing um from Mike's point
of<00:01:47.460> view<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.850> starts<00:01:48.210> off<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> red<00:01:49.700> from

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of view it starts off with the red from

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
of view it starts off with the red from
the<00:01:50.820> front<00:01:51.119> fork<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.869> don't<00:01:52.049> count<00:01:52.290> this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the front fork you don't count this

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
the front fork you don't count this
which<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> black<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> silver<00:01:53.790> obviously<00:01:54.450> and

which is black and silver obviously and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
which is black and silver obviously and
it<00:01:55.259> goes<00:01:55.439> into<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.250> graffiti<00:01:56.460> saying

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
it goes into this like graffiti saying

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.450 
it goes into this like graffiti saying
diamond<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.570> into<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> silver<00:01:58.500> part<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> at

diamond back into the silver part and at

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
diamond back into the silver part and at
the<00:01:59.610> very<00:01:59.759> end<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> red<00:02:02.159> part<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> um

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the very end as the red part again so um

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
after that let's look at the front fork

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.880 
after that let's look at the front fork
the<00:02:08.580> front<00:02:08.819> fork<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.259> hardtail<00:02:10.649> bike
