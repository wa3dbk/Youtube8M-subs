00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello together I wanted to join me today 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.710
 you set the over-lures machine 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 and to commit mistakes 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 the first mistake many make 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.110
 do not pull that thread out of the tree 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.080
 very important and you also have to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.890
 Pay attention that all threads in the guides 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.689
 hang yes then I'll show you at the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.779
 opportunity the same as manganese 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.310
 exchanges and what to do to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.080
 example, like to take normal roles 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 and there you see those white parts 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.079
 you just have to plug in and also 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.340
 moor and pull through the lead 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.149
 not easy with one hand 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
 I only do it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.950
 Demonstration purposes I give myself 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.980
 still a bit hard 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 yes and how you see that is with me 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.680
 always the first official I watch 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 if all threads are right in the guides 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 are in there because that's usually the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 first cause why the machine is not 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.789
 really do not like me now the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 the black cylinder on the stick will be the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.030
 machine prepared if your big 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 victim lures cabbage so takes 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 kuhn industry large and vice versa halt 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 if you take this household co the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.729
 i just got on the machine in that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 But I have another yellow one 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 politicians put it in herbede 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 sew better which can recognize 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.159
 learn which leadership is the second 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 There are many areas here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.030
 you see it is because many think 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 It would be cotton now 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.950
 Please take one for the victims 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.710
 tree volcanoes because you are traveling 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.170
 due to the relaxation 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.780
 yes, if the threads are too loose for you or 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.400
 you tangle the threads you have the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 possibility you can use the included 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.570
 Use laws that die over you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.060
 coal over and it looks like that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.850
 thread evenly and slowly 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.800
 Hard to pull from the crown 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.300
 becomes 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.000
 This gives you a more even 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.210
 thread tension and yes less chance 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.380
 that the many fields come then 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.270
 Let's go to the step width 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.649
 attitude that is the wheel to yours 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:12.510
 left at the machine 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:15.750
 this goes from 4 to 7 44 millimeters and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.360
 seven eg 7 mm that would mean if 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.480
 the cut wide wheel on 7 stands 7 mm 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.709
 cut away from the fabric 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.790
 you have to with your Schnittmustern 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.920
 take half into account 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.959
 Here you see that want to sleep 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 that means you have to cut the width 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.030
 once you raise and you have the thread 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 increase the tension of blue and purple 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.640
 I usually have my cutting width 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.950
 adjusted to 7 mm and fit 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.000
 voltage on 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.610
 Here you see again from the back 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.580
 the event of the claw 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.540
 still too loose so under attack 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.670
 increase the voltage 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.099
 can form on your fabric can always 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.930
 still sleeping under the grasps of the 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.670
 Tension purple is because they the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.130
 fabric is not tight enough on the knife 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.630
 have passed here you see that 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.250
 follow the loops of mother shepherd 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.550
 pull up that means you have to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.500
 reduce tension of the lower jaw 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.239
 here the threads of the attacker are something 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.810
 Too loose here, the plant must be increased 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.940
 become 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.940
 In that case would be the blue flags 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.940
 guide 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.060
 Here you see that the blockade leadership 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.950
 so the upper claws too small and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.250
 the claw is set too high 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.230
 is 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.170
 then I want you now 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.540
 explain differential when it's on 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 arises both run your transport 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.710
 as fast 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.940
 you often see jersey or stretchy ones 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.510
 it is recommended that the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.280
 to increase transporter to 1 5 or 2 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.960
 that means the front one 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 transporter the fabric faster 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.260
 transported as the rear away 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.940
 can transport 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 and so is a wave message almost 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.570
 impossible that works 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.850
 Of course, vice versa you can 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.610
 differences to 0.7 represent that means 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.890
 that the rear feed dog faster 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.930
 as the front and the fabric faster 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.460
 Transported away uses this feature 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.860
 you when you realize that the seam 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.750
 compressed looks so the suture is 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.440
 namely pulled apart a bit more 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.760
 and you keep a clean picture 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.260
 that does not matter now with this material 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.420
 sense because I lately with this material 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.430
 I've already sewn a house 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.859
 that I am interested in this fabric 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.260
 So two tests must be done with one 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.970
 Sample fabric piece before your attitude 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.830
 the machines before he starts with the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.290
 we continue sewing with the step 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.060
 wide settings ghp stands for pico 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.690
 could that be for fine fabrics like 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.650
 silk 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.500
 rfd for rolser the handling of p &amp; r 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.940
 you can see in the video role 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.140
 most common cut wide setting 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.140
 which he will probably use 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.300
 is between 2 and 3.5 at this point 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.040
 times the note on the subject need it 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.720
 be for the overlook basically 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.260
 only stretch or super stretch needles 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.660
 used 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.160
 It makes sense to stretch needles in 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.750
 to buy different strengths for 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.570
 light fabrics of course the light ones 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.790
 needles and for the stronger fabrics the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.190
 but somewhat thicker needles, as a rule 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.440
 75s are doing quite well as well as needles 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.470
 He just can see I have a piece 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.730
 denim overall with its six 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.990
 lay 75er needle works great 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.490
 As you sew, you notice that the seam is approaching 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.000
 on the right side becomes visible 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.070
 Do you have to raise the upper fan voltage 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.430
 and I would say that very carefully 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.430
 always turn one number higher 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.750
 that's usually enough 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.540
 around the seam is no longer visible 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.390
 to let and best used too 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.100
 I can match the color 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.960
 think these are the most common 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.900
 on the way a mistake and problems the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.970
 show up at ovag and I hope 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.260
 I could help you and I would 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.490
 I look forward to the next one 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.100
 to see you again 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.480
 until then have fun with my blog 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.480
 I like to look over. I 'm happy
