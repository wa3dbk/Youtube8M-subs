00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
just wear it like this I think I'll have

just wear it like this I think I'll have
to<00:02:25.670> take<00:02:25.879> off<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.209> but<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> thing<00:02:27.079> though

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
to take off the but the thing though

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.190 
to take off the but the thing though
kind<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.010> really<00:02:28.310> touch<00:02:28.489> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> loose<00:02:29.049> let<00:02:30.049> me

just<00:02:30.410> take<00:02:30.620> off<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.040> butt<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:33.200> actually
