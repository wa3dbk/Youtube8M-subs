00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.260
 the importance of not repeating the good 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.259
 genetically modified or transgenic organisms 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.519
 modified by transfer by the introduction of genetic material 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.150
 from an expression the species towards the mountain range and all species that is impersonal 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:27.710
 in a species of the are access them here they are modified and there the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.529
 what happens to this cell in the past 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.080
 to exercise power a different function now 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640
 It is common for the kind of legend 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.460
 That's what I'm going to say here for you, year. 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.050
 I accompany the noon 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.360
 law treats you now has answered that it is something distant and unique that what is 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.040
 certain is in the technique as for example your next are several chest 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.530
 introduction of biological and physical chemical processes to gain 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.310
 I put here for you only one physical 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.610
 now with the importance of the battle 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.700
 we will here analyze a very common clinical picture of our population 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 pass 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 it's the payments 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.080
 in the old cabinets how it was treated 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.680
 was treated with bovine isonomia that the minister 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.390
 look well 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.230
 yes and no if in this case the patient develops this reason for rejection 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.420
 other insulin piece 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.189
 the open health treatment she expects is totally compromised 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.579
 many of the cases 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.010
 beck and bovine insulin beck rejected by the patients 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.330
 Who did you make to India and China? 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.980
 she tried to introduce 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.880
 to gain mango his was able to insulin to have a bacterium 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.140
 and this bacterium passed thus of the human relation 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.909
 and this dream is good today 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.060
 it is sold commercially even distributed by the government 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.100
 for the most deprived populations 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.570
 and today the diabetes in many patients are totally controlled 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.950
 an innocuous decision 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.859
 So how come you do not walk on bacteria? 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.159
 so follow me with this image that shows 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.569
 exactly as it is done in a bag 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.749
 the question is if they human then human action I do ok 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.999
 the extraction of dna 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.559
 stop winning I use the eurid law at the beginning of class 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.999
 a restriction enzyme 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.999
 restriction enzyme by the current high when 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.079
 and here I have to reduce the inhibition on the side 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.720
 this gene the team away in this so irresponsible 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.319
 by simple resume 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.999
 Let's go now to the other side. 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.969
 cell cells 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.339
 of the action would encompass two or a plasmid which is this structure here 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.589
 professed that it is the corn place 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.769
 the plasmid can see if a path of being so 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.219
 if one of the genetic material of the battery starve book 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.660
 the wrong plasmid is 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.799
 of a chapter 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.079
 then almost half a million island my friend my student 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:13.889
 it is the pattern and partial of the genetic material to be paid for the land in that 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:14.830
 matter 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.549
 I think about this plasme matter 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.170
 So what do I do that term corn successfully dealt with the rejection 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.469
 that happens 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.909
 When I treat a medical emergency regime, it opens up. 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.239
 and now what do I do together a plasmid with a human gene from 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.189
 insulin 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.100
 and then what do I do, get plasmid blackberry 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.930
 I entered 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.149
 This is nuclear matter and yes 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.639
 dna that introduce a bacterium 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.189
 this personal introduction is known as a veto or biological and here as 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.889
 scene according to technique the introduction of loyal 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.539
 Because I did not sing, I used it here. 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.790
 A biological structure is a plasmid 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 for the battery cooperation in recognizing and acquitted this is mine 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.909
 and sharing that what is going to happen 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.629
 this matter will go on to produce human insulin 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.839
 Become a Translator 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.039
 this is the great importance of the foreigner 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.530
 the journalists coming they are able 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.529
 d make you laugh ps 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.870
 he 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.309
 had characteristics that are not common spheres 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:33.219
 who would 50 years ago imagine a bacterium producing insulin 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.960
 human 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.569
 it's just you 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.629
 or else 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.139
 the phosphorescent lookout goalkeeper 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.479
 it's right this was not appropriate then what I give 50 years 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.200
 behind 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.629
 is a totally wrong today's fiction of a man has a power 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.760
 genetic variability of gene combination 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.749
 very large 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:55.080
 so let's now answer the letter b 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.289
 look that 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.530
 in letter b since italy gives to you again visualized would have 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.090
 and here also holds for the importance 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.099
 of transgenic bacteria 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.139
 then transgenic bacteria are 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.750
 at that time not but are miguel factories or 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.139
 bioreactors of substances of human interest 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.389
 such as medicines 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.560
 as for example in sulina we also have other rumors of growth 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.580
 if we have a lot of medicines that are produced today 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.150
 careful that it is not they are not produced by these bio 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.539
 factories ok
