00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Welcome to the meanwhile 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.390
 tenth issue of insights on now 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.429
 maybe there is one already 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.330
 while and now I throw a glance 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.219
 on shuffle or shuffle lp sheep resp 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.880
 formerly he still managed to create lp 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.640
 currently nearly 465,000 subscribers and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.600
 counts as many as 91 million video views 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 at 935 uploaded videos tom has 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.029
 opened its canal on july 13 , 2011 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
 and therefore already belongs to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.920
 generation of older minecraft channels 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 on youtube shuffle is one of the channels 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 I have known for a long time and 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 also really like to pursue 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 but unfortunately the shuffle has some 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 Videos deleted from the beginning and thus is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 the first video which is online 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 shuffles old intro which i would 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.480
 Now just to say that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.520
 intro at all was or 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 still somehow though it is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.899
 no longer used everyone knew 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 just the intro and shuffle has it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.079
 even in a time where it is not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.539
 really 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.659
 the standard was that means only a few 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 youtuber had and therefore this became 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.530
 especially celebrated, especially white 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 was really cool and that was also a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.270
 little different from the usual intros 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.729
 then and especially the music became 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.170
 celebrated abnormally and the rock of the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.970
 song has been made by 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.920
 actually pretty well known 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 then it went with a skype blog 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 let's play, which is pretty 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 was known at the time and if I look at the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.570
 I do miss researchers directly 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 again all the old projects of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.079
 all youtuber then went on 20 03 2012 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 it with one of the best known to dance 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.430
 place los tom and his companion 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.619
 played minecraft together and took 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 that of course also on many knew 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.270
 plail explain by but really many 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.579
 had never made videos but only 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 he was simply in all sorts of videos 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.030
 He is currently from sheep to guest 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.500
 no longer it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.270
 or actually almost 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.100
 no longer the case that he is somewhere in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 a video from sheep to guest is 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.149
 shuffle lp always had it back then 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.100
 snapshot reviews made and he was too 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.129
 one of the few who did that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.989
 or who has done well anyway 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.760
 the main component of his videos more 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.860
 in the direction of let's play 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 for example, the fighters followed 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.299
 a then very innovative web and the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 found over sheep so cool that I was back then 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.379
 even started in let's play of it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.390
 there was still much to follow in the 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.700
 direction let's just play it 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.709
 minecraft i can only contact a few 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
 do not remember minecraft videos 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.930
 otherwise, for example, there was adventure 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 with sander text or some specials 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.159
 to see his channel but look now 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.989
 Let's get back to the present shuffle 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.560
 is by no means a typical minecraft 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.970
 youtuber more with a lot of pvp daily 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.220
 several videos among all sorts 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.659
 recording path and that 's shuffle 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.269
 not anymore or was 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.459
 actually fasting at shuffle counts 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.269
 currently rather the sentence quality instead 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.639
 quantity 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.709
 there were times a few weeks ago where 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.659
 Almost no videos came and go 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.819
 Partly a few weeks break 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.010
 but lately there are 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.019
 regular videos and they come too 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.069
 very good and he also gets many 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.590
 subscribers again 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.569
 despite the many single player recordings 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.909
 currently we find on shuffles channel 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.949
 mod reviews which are great 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.680
 they are both funny as well 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.109
 qualitatively one noticed shuffle much time 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.419
 in his videos reinsteckt from found 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.489
 a bit for video editing 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.970
 are still some minecraft maps the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.370
 shuffle at eg 50 seconds or minecraft 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.010
 pacman also seldom one 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 minecraft video is in the process he answered 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.090
 the time also like to ask in his 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 video and you really notice that shuffle 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.810
 very down to earth is the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.410
 quality of his videos turns 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.269
 paid 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.220
 He does not list that many 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.379
 Overall, because he clicks 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.510
 but less videos uploads for that 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.669
 he gets compared to other his 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.459
 abo size enormously much clicks on 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.199
 single videos and he also has eight, for example 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.919
 videos with more than a million 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.199
 visits 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.250
 which only a few minecraft of its kind 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.620
 can claim 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.740
 two of them even go direction 10 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.750
 millions 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.040
 really blatant but what do you have to 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.810
 everything else about it 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.150
 shuffle was never real 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.710
 a friend of la face cam and he had 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.310
 actually never wish to 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.380
 demonstrate 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.450
 but last year at the gamescom was 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 the first time to see him publicly 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.860
 without anyone knowing it before 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.810
 Anyway, it was on a stage back then 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.390
 and thus some already knew his 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.430
 face a few weeks or days later 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.800
 had then also shown on youtube 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.230
 Since then he likes to work with face com 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 and make funny grimaces five shuffle 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.280
 by the way, and crafters have earlier more often 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.790
 times videos made together but there was 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.260
 once a dispute because contrasts 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.290
 allegedly made a lot of 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.270
 shuffle from intro music to porous 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.940
 to channel design and much more 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.380
 he supposedly asked but what exactly there 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.750
 should have gone now 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.790
 or we still know today 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.980
 not really the whole thing is 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.530
 meanwhile from the table and board was to 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.110
 For example, hero and was by 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.820
 Crafter also was and stood here 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.160
 the two in the first video even 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.560
 next to each other as well as all the participants 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.390
 were set up and I think that listens 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.430
 Stupid but I think that was 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.930
 not the case if somehow it's one 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.490
 Crash with each other would have shuffle 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.410
 I follow now as I already said 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.000
 really very long and both his 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.860
 I really like great old videos 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.960
 but of course I want to 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.790
 the new super I'm curious how 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.530
 the channel of tom is still developing 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.480
 and if he is more about that now 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.250
 ritual p want to know clicks on 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.840
 best on the left video because there 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.510
 actually comes on over that 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.120
 currently it is now fixed 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.220
 Microsoft has bought mo yan and more 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.200
 you will learn in the video on the right 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.280
 i say thank you for seeing we see 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.810
 us at the next video 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.160
 do not forget to rate and one 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.780
 I'm pleased to write a comment 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.990
 really huge thanks for watching and 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.990
 ciao
