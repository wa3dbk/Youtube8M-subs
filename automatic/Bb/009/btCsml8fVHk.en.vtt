00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 Hello friends and guests of the channel to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.809
 our cows were not starving and were always 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.780
 satisfied we need a technique for 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.590
 cooking hay and you see the whole 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 the lineup 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.350
 that's all we need right away 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.019
 I will say that pleasure is not cheap 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.720
 All this equipment excludes tractor 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.340
 costs about 300 thousand and let's 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.700
 let's take a closer look at first mowing 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 mower wardrobe case pc 960 28 thousand three hundred 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:45.360
 she stands next to us hay tedded to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 Putin gear fit 26 thousand two hundred that's how 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.770
 she looks next 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.430
 we need a roll header to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 fold 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.800
 mowed hay rolls it costs 29 thousand 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.800
 hundred 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.590
 then we need you dipper for 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.900
 square bales I will tell you further 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.800
 why precisely for square since 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.390
 there is also a round bale crate worth this 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.180
 bale pike 120,000 as much as well 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 the last thing we need is so 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.320
 special trailer called a cousin 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 of the stack it automatically collects 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.040
 these bales and fit into it 18 pieces we 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.670
 then with you we can take these bitches to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.229
 farm well and let's look at how with 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.229
 this technique is controlled 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.690
 and so principle forward everything to the mower a 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.720
 back axlet mailing we are with you 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.910
 we get two in one 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 at the same time cassin hay and right there 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.280
 overturn that include one that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.280
 the second 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.069
 and you see immediately there is a mowing and immediately 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:20.160
 turns the grass turns out we 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:22.739
 Hay is another option without hay tedders 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.040
 that is, we could buy more with you 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.440
 one here's a coffee to put it behind 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.379
 or vice versa these 2 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.660
 garden and 1 front and then we would be with you 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.400
 all the grass was completely downloaded as well 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.890
 of course in the center we have a little bit 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.099
 grass remains not mown but I think 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.769
 that time is more expensive 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.569
 possible to mow the grass in this way 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:53.459
 looks and is not very optimal but 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:55.890
 faster after you mowed 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.970
 grass dried it we need it now 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.950
 to roll 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.879
 in order to be convenient to collect 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.879
 bale cheek 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.940
 when the hay is collected rolls now remains 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:13.570
 only collect his bales cheeks and make 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.520
 here such here bales with one row here 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.850
 such a field we get 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.190
 about 1 bale that is how many 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.160
 rows so many bales you see that 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.690
 there are about a dozen of us here 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.270
 years well and the last thing we need with you 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.530
 make it collect the resulting bales and 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.530
 take them to the farms 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.990
 a special feature here is this trailer 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.090
 is that we can on 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.280
 maximum speed pick these 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.200
 the bales 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.420
 see that I have a speed of forty now 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.040
 more than an kilometer an hour and quite 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.650
 we cope with you no problems 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.600
 when all the bales on the field are collected remains 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.340
 only one 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.270
 take them to the farm and please our 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.650
 cows you can see that i have 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.140
 first three bales 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.420
 it's straw it's all because i cleaned 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.750
 straw and these three bales remain 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.880
 always a routine that is when i will 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.890
 remove the straw on some of the fields then 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.350
 3 bales of hay fall out of bale cheek 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.230
 just turns out with this small 27 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.520
 fields I will remind you here it is here 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.680
 this size 10 kicks 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.050
 ten centuries is all for it quite i think 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.210
 that's enough for our cows 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.570
 we only need to unload these 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.570
 bales and voila we have n. 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.370
 here they are neatly unloaded and bales and 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.159
 now we are left with just this 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.020
 loader load their mixer or in 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:07.139

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.349
