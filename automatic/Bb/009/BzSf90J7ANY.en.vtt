00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
we'll definitely need to get revived

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.090 
we'll definitely need to get revived
that<00:02:14.940> they<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.170> revived<00:02:16.590> your<00:02:16.860> team

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
that they do not get revived your team

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.190 
that they do not get revived your team
could<00:02:17.310> potentially<00:02:17.940> lose<00:02:18.240> because<00:02:18.690> you'll<00:02:19.020> be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
could potentially lose because you'll be

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.930 
could potentially lose because you'll be
the<00:02:19.320> last<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.340> lot<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> zombies

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
the last one in and a lot of zombies

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.810 
the last one in and a lot of zombies
will<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.420> chasing<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.960> instead<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.310> enemy

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
will be chasing you instead of the enemy

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.610 
will be chasing you instead of the enemy
and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.390> enemy<00:02:24.420> could<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.170> slowing<00:02:25.440> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and the enemy could just be slowing you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.260 
and the enemy could just be slowing you
down<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.100> don't<00:02:26.310> recommend<00:02:26.580> staying<00:02:27.030> close

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
down so I don't recommend staying close

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.540 
down so I don't recommend staying close
to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.540> enemy<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.710> recommend<00:02:29.160> having<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
to the enemy and I recommend having a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.699 
to the enemy and I recommend having a
fast<00:02:29.910> gun<00:02:30.209> where<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.870> move<00:02:31.020> around<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
fast gun where you can move around and

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.190 
fast gun where you can move around and
just<00:02:31.920> move<00:02:32.220> around<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.180> fast<00:02:33.450> so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
just move around like really fast so

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260 
just move around like really fast so
that's<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:35.070> important<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> fast

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
that's really important to have a fast

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.180 
that's really important to have a fast
gun<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.840> spray<00:02:37.170> around<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.650> map<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
gun so you can spray around the map and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.970 
gun so you can spray around the map and
they<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.300> own<00:02:39.480> everywhere<00:02:40.140> zombies<00:02:40.709> this

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
they you can own everywhere zombies this

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.160 
they you can own everywhere zombies this
map<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.340> not<00:02:41.820> that<00:02:42.060> hard<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.050> do

is open the doors and go in circles and
it<00:02:45.690> really<00:02:45.870> does<00:02:46.140> take<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> long<00:02:46.590> time<00:02:46.770> see
