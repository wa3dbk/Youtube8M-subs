00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.059
 tutorial on gk 5 and i will you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.049
 instance do that on an xbox version 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.570
 360 and I have some advice to give you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.150
 do that on a profile that is not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 connected to the deich it is better still 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.779
 we eat with it's sit profile 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.090
 that I write to as I have pretty little 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.920
 used if he tells you that it's better 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 do that on a profile not connect to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 live 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 it's only because after you have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.540
 ban risks and not being able to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 play to gta line thereafter 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.210
 good while waiting for you while she 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.960
 that there is a little gameplay that is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.840
 unfold before your eyes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 Obviously it is deferred and here I 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
 just show you for example my 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.300
 sum of money all my skills that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.039
 are thoroughly 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 you will see also when I will be 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.280
 am and cop I am invincible 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 yes the future allows 34 of its 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.620
 leizer advantages raises quite a lot of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.020
 things that's why I fear you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 laughed on it well but had seen a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 little bit of gameplay we can pass 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 to practice 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.240
 or for this tutorial you are going to have 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.350
 need software and an object 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.790
 the object in this case is a kit of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.979
 transfer for hard drive and he boxing 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.509

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.159
 here is the picture is also even you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 plus all how we do for them 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 are suffering from the crisis b leader 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.600
 go through the software all that I 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.479

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 ch with the eSports and backups 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.110
 that I was loaded on gta entzheim 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 obviously all the links of this number 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.680
 from elsewhere for those who 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.159
 want fashion is a little bit their 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.020
 console 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 lojie sunrise i showed you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.869
 lausseignan in the inscription but 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.890
 that's how it took a lot of 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.360
 yale wrong is sure it can be 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 interesting for her to think herself in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 cursed so here is the site logic sunrise 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 the perfect site to learn how to fashion 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.890
 therefore we help you and the hardware and 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the jtag and all that is needed and in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.399
 the occurrence for tgx port this is where 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 I went here I wanted them 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.280
 re-enrollments do not hesitate to go there 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.329
 do not hesitate to throw a little 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.649
 hesc could possibly 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.659
 to do there are some stuff that you're going to 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.520
 little to do but gabriel that were 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.450
 erased since the time is one who are 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.250
 marked obsolete 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.509
 so some of it is useless 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.500
 to try to make them 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.939
 but no we download 805 so the link 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.069
 will be said waiting for the inscription not the 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.620
 hardly you looking for yourself 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.090
 will already be provided and once these two 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 downloaded and installed software 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.700
 we will connect the hard drive with or 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.709
 that they transfer tessa opc and thanks to 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 expo you will detect risk duration 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.879
 you will be able to recover your 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.180
 guide so once you have 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.459
 open software with your hard drives 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 connected you're going to have to go on 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.659
 vices of so you do 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.120
 the little more then you have three 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.250

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.329
 have lots of files with eggs 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.030
 Sero Zero and other numbers listen 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.220
 so having found it yourself 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.829

 let it be the last one 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.810
 that's because I had only one 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.000
 backup and it was that of gta 5 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.269
 so this text and this profile there that I 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.090
 wanted fashion and if you want word d 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.340
 try to make clinical profile no

 backup has gone from 'buy' to 5 this 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.069
 will be much more convenient 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.389

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.639
 find your file to note that 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.780
 when you open your file 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.579
 against your backup 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.980
 the chef always suggests you to do 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.989

 under shit as you want so 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.090
 you have a lot of choice this thing so 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.780
 for example you can change the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.180
 amount of money 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.699
 you can change civ if he has a vest 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.790

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:06.479
 abilities to say themselves like tyranny the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.400
 fauna have carried half that you 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:11.040
 can you also who is bet and 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.690
 the weapons that unlock so precisely 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.280
 your debut you are not unlocking 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.739
 a lot of weapons you can go in 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.389
 another unlock category if you 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.609
 could unlock all the arts were 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.620
 obviously that according to your ability in 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.199
 drawn 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.690
 not the maximum boob will be different 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.060
 obviously we will say that we have the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.190
 bottomed shooting ability of the Nobel blow 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.490

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.400
 money if you want not bad the mac this 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.199
 that I can be a small billion by 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.729
 example to have for example a vest 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.530
 Bulletproof bottom you double click 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.900
 in the bar because otherwise it's a 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.990
 little bit hard working to succeed 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.570
 in clients just once the same for the 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.580

 how it fits 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.139
 the search cues I imagine that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.389

 space the underwater waste and 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.680

 save your file close the 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.949
 file and then closed the software and 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.970
 then you will have to re-import 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:14.210
