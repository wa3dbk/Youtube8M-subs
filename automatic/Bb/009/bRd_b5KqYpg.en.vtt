00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
drop in the price of oil so the WT is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.290

September Canada is a heavy oil
exporting<00:00:49.890> country<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:52.379> concern<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
exporting country so the concern is that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.430 
exporting country so the concern is that
the<00:00:53.340> impact<00:00:53.910> will<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.570> significant<00:00:55.260> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
incomes in the country so the concern

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
incomes in the country so the concern
really<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.699> recent<00:01:00.180> drop<00:01:00.480> in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
really is that the recent drop in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.310 
really is that the recent drop in
commodity<00:01:01.350> prices<00:01:01.379> could<00:01:01.949> potentially

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
commodity prices could potentially

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.399 
commodity prices could potentially
temper<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.470> momentum<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.339> 2015<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
temper that momentum going into 2015 and

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
temper that momentum going into 2015 and
how<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> strengthening<00:01:08.369> US<00:01:08.549> economy

we<00:02:16.650> don't<00:02:16.829> think<00:02:17.129> that<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.939> housing<00:02:18.150> market

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
we don't think that the housing market

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.319 
we don't think that the housing market
is<00:02:18.659> set<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.400> crutch<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.579> normal<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.239> we

is set for a crutch in normal do we

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.940 
is set for a crutch in normal do we
expect<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.659> see<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.959> same<00:02:22.170> type<00:02:22.439> of<00:02:22.470> consumer

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.280 
expect to see the same type of consumer
deleveraging<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.849> we<00:02:23.970> saw<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> US<00:02:25.140> but

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
deleveraging that we saw in the US but

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
deleveraging that we saw in the US but
we<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.530> think<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.890> interest<00:02:26.159> rates<00:02:26.280> rise<00:02:26.670> we

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
we do think as interest rates rise we

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.149 
we do think as interest rates rise we
could<00:02:27.629> potentially<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.409> slowdown<00:02:28.680> in

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
could potentially see a slowdown in

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.309 
could potentially see a slowdown in
household<00:02:29.879> spending<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.900> slight

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
household spending and a slight

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.699 
household spending and a slight
unwinding<00:02:32.099> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.299> Canadian<00:02:33.989> housing<00:02:34.349> market

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
unwinding in the Canadian housing market

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.250 
unwinding in the Canadian housing market
so<00:02:34.950> over<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> long<00:02:36.000> term<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.540> expect<00:02:36.750> these

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
so over the long term we do expect these

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.349 
so over the long term we do expect these
two<00:02:37.620> key<00:02:38.040> factors<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.670> constraints<00:02:39.239> to

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
two key factors to be constraints to

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.089 
two key factors to be constraints to
economic<00:02:39.810> growth<00:02:39.840> even<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.739> export

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
economic growth even as the export

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.949 
economic growth even as the export
