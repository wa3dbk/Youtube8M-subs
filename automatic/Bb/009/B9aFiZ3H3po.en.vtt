00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
sound I guess but it's not like exactly

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.050 
sound I guess but it's not like exactly
was<00:04:07.850> pretty<00:04:08.840> like<00:04:09.020> it<00:04:09.170> like<00:04:09.850> Factory<00:04:10.850> less

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
was pretty like it like Factory less

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.710

sexy<00:04:11.750> yeah<00:04:12.700> lovely<00:04:13.700> things<00:04:14.030> yeah<00:04:14.390> but<00:04:14.600> that

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
sexy yeah lovely things yeah but that

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:25.000 
sexy yeah lovely things yeah but that
the<00:04:14.930> pixel<00:04:15.410> pixel<00:04:21.490> so<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:24.590> just<00:04:24.740> short

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
the pixel pixel so but it's just short

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.560 
the pixel pixel so but it's just short
yeah<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.970> think<00:04:26.060> it's<00:04:26.240> pretty<00:04:26.360> much<00:04:26.510> like

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
yeah I think it's pretty much like

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.840 
yeah I think it's pretty much like
people<00:04:27.290> make<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.440> big<00:04:27.650> deal<00:04:27.800> honestly<00:04:28.040> over

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
people make a big deal honestly over

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.330 
people make a big deal honestly over
sexualized<00:04:29.240> things<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.840> then<00:04:30.100> when<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.190> take

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
sexualized things and then when you take

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.920 
sexualized things and then when you take
out<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.550> pixels<00:04:31.880> all<00:04:31.970> cute<00:04:32.210> stuff<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.690> think

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
out the pixels all cute stuff I think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.820 
out the pixels all cute stuff I think
that's<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:34.780> guess<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:36.050> could<00:04:36.200> be<00:04:36.290> meaning<00:04:36.650> that

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's I guess it could be meaning that

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.670 
that's I guess it could be meaning that
like<00:04:37.130> just<00:04:37.580> because<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:38.510> do<00:04:38.660> sexy<00:04:39.080> confidence

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680
