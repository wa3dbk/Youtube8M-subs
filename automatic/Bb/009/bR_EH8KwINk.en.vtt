two or three depends on how deep the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:55.330 
two or three depends on how deep the
area<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.880> no<00:03:52.880> Marie<00:03:53.060> when<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.050> are<00:03:54.340> the

area is and no Marie when you are the
squeegee<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:55.819> pouring<00:03:56.300> that's<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.080> time<00:03:57.459> you

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
squeegee is pouring that's the time you

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.690 
squeegee is pouring that's the time you
most<00:03:58.700> likely<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.209> get<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.599> squeeze<00:04:00.230> on
