00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
of like this I guess perk machine

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.790 
of like this I guess perk machine
looking<00:01:08.610> thing<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.870> fire<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.440> over

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
it and you know at first I thought wow

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.700 
it and you know at first I thought wow
this<00:01:12.510> could<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:13.050> a<00:01:13.080> perk<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.680> thought

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
this could be a perk but then I thought

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
this could be a perk but then I thought
nope<00:01:14.670> that's<00:01:14.910> not<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.120> perk<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.660> I<00:01:15.690> started

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
nope that's not a perk so I started

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.510 
nope that's not a perk so I started
looking<00:01:16.050> well<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> perk<00:01:17.280> than

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
looking well if it's not a perk than

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.030 
looking well if it's not a perk than
what<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.510> it<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.050> I<00:01:19.140> thought<00:01:19.320> well<00:01:19.620> there's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
what is it then I thought well there's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
what is it then I thought well there's
trees<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.490> over<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> place<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.750> seems<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
trees all over the place there seems to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410
