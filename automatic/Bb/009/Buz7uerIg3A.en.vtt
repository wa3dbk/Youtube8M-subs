we've<00:00:00.510> been<00:00:00.630> talking<00:00:00.750> about<00:00:00.960> evidence<00:00:01.260> for

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
we've been talking about evidence for

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.020 
we've been talking about evidence for
evolution<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> one<00:00:02.490> another<00:00:02.730> one<00:00:02.939> of

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
evolution and this is one another one of

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.180 
evolution and this is one another one of
those<00:00:03.120> cool<00:00:03.510> examples<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.440> evidence<00:00:05.040> that's

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
those cool examples of evidence that's

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.070 
those cool examples of evidence that's
hard<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.580> refute<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.690> call<00:00:06.899> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
hard to refute and we call this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.230 
hard to refute and we call this
embryology<00:00:07.980> or<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.309> study<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.820> embryonic

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
embryology or the study of embryonic

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.509 
embryology or the study of embryonic
formation<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.050> development<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.920> when<00:00:11.460> you

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
formation and development and when you

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.180 
formation and development and when you
see<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.150> compared<00:00:12.929> ways<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.920> different

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
see in compared ways that different

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.220 
see in compared ways that different
kinds<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> animals<00:00:15.179> evolved<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.839> will<00:00:15.990> see

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
kinds of animals evolved you will see

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.130 
kinds of animals evolved you will see
that<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.310> they<00:00:17.760> change<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.539> develop<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that as they change and develop in the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
that as they change and develop in the
uterus<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.890> kind<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.189> mimics<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
uterus it kind of mimics the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.179 
uterus it kind of mimics the
evolutionary<00:00:21.150> steps<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.560> particular

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
evolutionary steps that that particular

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740 
evolutionary steps that that particular
branch<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.670> Tree<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> Life<00:00:24.060> had<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> go

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
branch of the Tree of Life had to go

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
branch of the Tree of Life had to go
through<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.230> that's<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.800> beautiful<00:00:26.220> in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
through and that's actually beautiful in

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
through and that's actually beautiful in
my<00:00:26.640> opinion<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.210> actually<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:28.099> there<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> see

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
my opinion to actually see there you see

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.250 
my opinion to actually see there you see
a<00:00:29.400> picture<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.910> evolution<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.869> look<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
a picture of evolution as you look to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.569 
a picture of evolution as you look to
the<00:00:31.679> stage<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> embryonic<00:00:32.430> development

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the stage of the embryonic development

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
the stage of the embryonic development
for<00:00:33.540> example<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> first

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
for example when you look at the first

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.020 
for example when you look at the first
stage<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.950> development<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> human<00:00:35.820> embryo

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
stage of development of the human embryo

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.290 
stage of development of the human embryo
as<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.719> go<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> Marla<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
as you go from as I go to a Marla to a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750 
as you go from as I go to a Marla to a
blastula<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> grass<00:00:40.559> Allah<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.610> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
blastula to a grass Allah and then you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760 
blastula to a grass Allah and then you
do<00:00:42.120> tunner<00:00:42.629> Allah<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> newless

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
do tunner Allah and then the newless

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200 
do tunner Allah and then the newless
starts<00:00:44.100> differentiating<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.969> making

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
starts differentiating and making

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.540 
starts differentiating and making
different<00:00:45.329> cells<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.800> first<00:00:47.100> few<00:00:47.309> days

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
different cells on the first few days

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
different cells on the first few days
between<00:00:47.940> 9<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.600> actually<00:00:49.530> first<00:00:50.129> month<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
between 9 in actually first month the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
between 9 in actually first month the
first<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.120> weeks<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.410> tiny

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
first four weeks we're very very tiny

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.459 
first four weeks we're very very tiny
tiny<00:00:53.039> embryos<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.840> gonna<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.050> until

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
tiny embryos and it's not gonna be until

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.310 
tiny embryos and it's not gonna be until
the<00:00:55.559> 23rd<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.309> 28th<00:00:56.730> day<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:57.989> actually

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the 23rd the 28th day that we actually

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
the 23rd the 28th day that we actually
start<00:00:58.649> looking<00:00:59.030> significantly<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
start looking significantly like a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
start looking significantly like a
primate<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.680> over<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
primate like you see over here at the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
primate like you see over here at the
very<00:01:02.370> end<00:01:02.670> before<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.199> through

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
very end before then we go through

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
very end before then we go through
stages<00:01:04.680> where<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.519> tails<00:01:05.909> look<00:01:06.210> at

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
stages where we even have tails look at

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.990 
stages where we even have tails look at
that<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.900> definitely<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.350> tail<00:01:07.590> over<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.040> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that so definitely a tail over there we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.210 
that so definitely a tail over there we
go<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> stages<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> may<00:01:10.290> even<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.799> gill

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
go to stages that we may even have gill

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.289 
go to stages that we may even have gill
slits<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:12.299> fish<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:13.650> amphibian<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.909> we

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
slits like fish do our amphibian and we

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
slits like fish do our amphibian and we
even<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.689> stages<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.409> look<00:01:16.619> decisively

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
even have stages that we look decisively

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.480 
even have stages that we look decisively
reptile<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.799> that's<00:01:19.799> because<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.280> are

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
reptile like and that's because we are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.280 
reptile like and that's because we are
reptiles<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
reptiles that's because we are in

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
reptiles that's because we are in
phidian's<00:01:23.869> what<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.560> about<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.580> evolved

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
phidian's what think about it we evolved

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.140 
phidian's what think about it we evolved
from<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.750> early<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.229> phibian<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.490> ended<00:01:30.030> up

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from an early and phibian we ended up

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
from an early and phibian we ended up
and<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.659> after<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.710> became<00:01:32.070> reptiles

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and then after that we became reptiles

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
and then after that we became reptiles
and<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> reptiles<00:01:33.630> evolved<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.439> mammals

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and in the reptiles evolved into mammals

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
and in the reptiles evolved into mammals
so<00:01:35.610> mammals<00:01:36.090> evolved<00:01:36.540> from<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.750> ancient

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so mammals evolved from an ancient

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.789 
so mammals evolved from an ancient
reptile

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
reptile

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.270 
reptile
Aptos<00:01:38.340> evolved<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:38.850> an<00:01:38.970> ancient<00:01:40.280> amphibian

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
Aptos evolved from an ancient amphibian

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
Aptos evolved from an ancient amphibian
and<00:01:41.369> Fitness<00:01:42.119> evolved<00:01:42.509> from<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.720> ancient<00:01:42.930> fish

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and Fitness evolved from an ancient fish

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.730 
and Fitness evolved from an ancient fish
and<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> progression<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.560> him

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and so as you see the progression of him

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
and so as you see the progression of him
during<00:01:46.890> development<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.790> actually

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
during development what you actually

all so similar from each other now of
course<00:02:50.970> there's<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> little<00:02:51.540> bit<00:02:51.750> of

course there's a little bit of
differentiation<00:02:52.380> but<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:53.220> because

differentiation but that's because

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.240 
differentiation but that's because
evolution<00:02:53.849> has<00:02:54.000> changed<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.319> homology<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:55.980> bit
