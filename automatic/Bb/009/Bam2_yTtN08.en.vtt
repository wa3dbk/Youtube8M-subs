00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
very low signal and then in this one it

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.540 
very low signal and then in this one it
doesn't<00:03:52.410> pick<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.620> up<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.160> didn't<00:03:53.340> pick<00:03:53.459> up

that's<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:02.250> pretty<00:04:02.489> lightweight<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:03.150> far<00:04:03.420> as

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
that's it's pretty lightweight as far as

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.410 
that's it's pretty lightweight as far as
a<00:04:04.220> resources<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.430> base<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.000> I'm<00:04:06.060> gonna<00:04:06.180> go

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420
