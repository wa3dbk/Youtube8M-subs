00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.690
 Well, as I explained earlier 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.889
 It is one as a function of this Eriko 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.150
 It is a light production 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:19.520
 I want to move to 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.690
 I think that you can get it when you look at the introduction, but there are blue and red 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.590
 This says something Red means that you are playing 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.010
 Child When you press the play button this say I'd become wind Nde has stopped now 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.260
 revolve 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.610
 Yes yes 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.790
 Hey you 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.150
 This blue is also a place 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.380
 It will of Pure Land Description 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.720
 When you apply effects 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.430
 that 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:51.930
 The production of this light also changes and becomes even more interesting 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.190
 So I just want to choose an effect 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130
 Is now plunger sand sandling 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.630
 Yes 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.630
 I would like to use a flanger 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070
 High 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 Hmm 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.510
 Anyway hard I mother 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.890
 Beat 2 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890
 I choose a lesson a little 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.540
 me 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.340
 It 's red when you apply the effect 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.420
 part bar 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.420
 I can move here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 Yes 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 It is often said that the way of directing light is also a bit gj's function 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.329
 I will 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 What is it characteristic is the marks It is a result Peter here 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:51.159
 This really shines to the sound 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:55.149
 You can use in accordance with the vita Even if you're that Naa hard to grasp Toka timing of the song 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.010
 It is made to be easy to understand Arcass so it may be a bit hard to see 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.880
 The 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.880
 De you I delusion 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.409
 High 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.530
 I will see you 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.850
 It will light up to the beat like this 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.810
 So this opposite side 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.020
 Song ab building 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.550
 If you can see this light at the time of materials 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.470
 Even if it is off, you will understand soon Yes 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.560
 so 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.410
 Let's go Well then further whether this earlier 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.410
 It's a blue place I'm flying 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.500
 If this is called something 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.180
 I understand if I see it a little more 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:41.430
 That light is totally different , but the cat is light blue 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.600
 I I'm here is thin this something and say you and the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.790
 More glowing if the glowing blue color 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.640
 It has become a mechanism that song rhythm is correct 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.750
 So if you shift a little , the color will be lighter, so it will be very easy to understand 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720
 It has become 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.760
 I really want to mix it 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.760
 Properly round 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.350
 I am 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.270
 Or compared to ask and look to do this but I might be a little difficult to understand and is good 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.840
 The 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.840
 I think i will 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:27.470
 I think the intensity of the color is different 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:31.750
 This is the state that the mix bit is out of the blue 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 It will get thicker then I really want to do it 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.810
 Send 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.210
 I was asked 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.800
 Yes 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:45.640
 This is that there is a beat, so yes that is that 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:52.270
 I think the waveform Toka do not know that well 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.610
 Even if you do n't see it for that reason , you can not mix easily- even those who have this blue 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.940
 As soon as Moraere watch 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.730
 Say can be confirmed because whether Beck's beat is correct 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.680
 Yes 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.140
 Such a function is really only English, so it is a function that other controllers do not have 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.989
 Visually very well 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.989
 I think it's a mix and a practitioner, yes 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:22.490
 It's an elbow that's a funny but this time it's the next video 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:31.139
 I think that it is good to mix using that seller and points 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:34.009
 Adg Chug NiÃ±o if you mean that in the way that is the time to is the dessert 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.009
 Please take a look
