00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 yes 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.260
 it's a rose like strangers or the cousin sun 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.910
 and good but it's very good in this 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.680
 occasion is bring a new video of gta 5 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.420
 online mode and good today we are going 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.480
 to take turns this vehicle which is called 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.700
 football and it is a vehicle that is worth 440 thousand 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 dollars and it's a sporty vehicle then 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.739
 it's luxurious and it's only two doors 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.210
 in a coupé type and well let's 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.489
 enter with this vehicle then to 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.170
 using is custom to which you prefer and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.730
 well let's start with the tunjo let's go 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.970
 to see what can be put as they can 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.010
 see in the back has two since 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.590
 pipes on each side which makes it 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.719
 more interesting the vehicle is bicolor 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.609
 obviously so well let's put 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.769
 the shielding then one hundred percent 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.500
 obviously we are going to the brakes here 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.910
 career brakes obviously we want 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.249
 so solid braking, you know when 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.320
 when you go that in career 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.440
 the engine, well, obviously, we're going to 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.720
 put the level four improvement 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.490
 six 6.365 so we left explosives 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.230
 obviously not for less than you want 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.910
 make a joke a friend 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.380
 the good action this flag are depends on 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.330
 I want to put it on my horn 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.330
 I'm not interested in having the most 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.800
 expensive lights obviously xenon 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.860
 which are the blue ones so that you look 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.660
 better night and loss prevention 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.950
 and robberies we already have it obviously because 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.290
 we buy it on the page so not 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 you have to buy them the plates the 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.570
 plates I like more in black 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.280
 the truth as yellow as that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.890
 stand out a little more so I like 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 place that now we're repainted 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.200
 one main color 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.580
 let's go to metals color I think that 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.990
 we met metallic and non-metallic 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 better and good here that will be good will be 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.020
 good to put a little yellow color not the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.350
 color cited yellow 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.359
 or one blue or yellow I do not follow the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.210
 yellows let's see how it looks with 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:09.610
 this and a yellow career we left 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.319
 from here we will go has pearled 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.480
 good we put yellow race also 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.430
 obviously to highlight more the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.349
 yellow with the secondary ones the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.910
 color that is in the middle part 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:25.000
 here we are going to look metallic bet 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.250
 here I would like it to be black and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080
 I believe 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.850
 yes I believe that black sector is admired 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.400
 much better or a red color 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.900
 I do not know what will be better, I think it will be 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.990
 better if a red one did not throw red lava 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.090
 formula did not throw formula to egg for 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.880
 place this we leave here we go 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.160
 there good emblems is that is to put 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.990
 one still if the suspension the suspension 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 obviously lower the vehicle all to 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.250
 me still sorry so obviously 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.370
 you can grab more speed in the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.770
 transmission good transmission there is no 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.600
 four different no what is the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.340
 standard transmission the original normal 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.860
 the street sports and the street 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 careers I prefer to have the career 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.040
 because I like to go full speed 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.660
 with the vehicle it unlocks to 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.510
 level 36 I think by winning 36 races but 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.890
 good the turbo good the turbo obviously 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.480
 you just have to put in to give it the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 as fast as possible if your 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.830
 vehicle you want it to be from the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.930
 better is not a tone because of turbo vale 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.330
 28,500 if you're not interested do not buy it 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.830
 since it is too expensive too 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.520
 it's one of the most expensive things here 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.840
 the wheels good the wheels I would like 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.990
 choose a color first but do not know 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.580
 can so glasses are luxury urine to 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.970
 I really like the wheels that are 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.230
 they call these 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 these 80 of the solar but I'm going to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.960
 place the lots now worth 10 thousand 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.850
 440 dollars and we put this we went out 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.430
 let's go to the colors above here we go 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.770
 to obviously put a yellow 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.290
 again a red color I think that 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.060
 it would be red not so that it looks better yes 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.030
 yes I believe that a little roll does not 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.590
 they are broken 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.260
 Red 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.930
 did not throw normal looks much better so 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.570
 a little more to the mother looks chingón 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.489
 the vehicle custom tires 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.650
 obviously so they continue a little bit 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.139
 more bulletproof egg tires for 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.710
 do not punch 7 punch in accra 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.639
 now the smoke because I think it would be 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.289
 red not egg 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.550
 we left here we go to the 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.560
 windows to me I really like how 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.849
 it looks polarized but I like that it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.529
 look at the monkey a little bit in 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.360
 I also do not know why but that container 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.240
 that looks a lot better so I'm going to 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.219
 put the dark smoked now we go out 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.259
 from here and we already have the vehicle 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:54.110
 totally finished we will see how 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.639
 you look and there when the sun hits 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.499
 You really look very nice I liked it 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.689
 liked and it's a vehicle that pulls very very 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.120
 well I was piercing and really I 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.590
 liked and you hear very well have five 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.229
 changes which makes the vehicle 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.509
 well run the truth the truth 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.069
 true the truth but good here they are 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.139
 hearing a bit of the vehicle if it is 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.240
 reach to listen but good 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.939
 vehicle runs pretty pretty well is 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.700
 very stable the truth I fall in love the 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:23.130
 vehicle I think he left stupid 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.880
 having already the vehicle then when 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.350
 goes around and sneaks a lot this is not 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.420
 this does not create anything of the other how much you 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.340
 you are the steering wheel you start to turn and 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.320
 the kind and obviously according to this by the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.910
 speed he has but has not had me 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.390
 I liked it better so I'll be good 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.830
 using this vehicle and mother what 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.580
 only bad is that when you want to give 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.070
 turn sometimes it's a little bit like that 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.330
 hard to say it like that but it's fine 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.800
 vehicle so you're going to like it 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.800
 very much I hope you liked that 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.810
 small was revised and tuned to 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.160
 vehicle so I hope you can 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.330
 give a little like to this video 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.130

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.380
 as a comment that in the part of 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.300
 down does not depend eating eating a lot 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.190
 but good excuse and I ask you 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.199

 totally live gentlemen but good 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.979
