00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.549
 Pet first is today's choice but 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.879
 etf first one is evo vii 7 low glycosides of the party of the party 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:15.879
 Japanese 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.490
 Is set 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.859
 So this is the first of today, it's also a mambo 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.140
 I'm going to be a plum worker, but it's big anyway 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.689
 It is also 4 grams- 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.449
 I am at the station 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.070
 I am trying to stop the public money of the company today 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.900
 I'm setting 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.490
 Data It is 5749 if it is 8749-2.5 pounds in the next data 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.290
 This is s first 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.160
 A little longer 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.660
 That's the biggest thing that's the biggest thing 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 Seems to be 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.910
 As p is expected to be such a little while ago 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.170
 There are sub-examples though 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.980
 I'm looking for 63 in the setting of nylon 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.800
 I set this 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.750
 But there is one 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.510
 It is five points of the mountain 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.800
 Emo but this is a light spoon 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.420
 I set up the exchange with my previous chan, but 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.660
 8 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 Maa's 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.710
 10 types of 1 gram remaining 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.880
 Pet dog 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.910
 Well 81.8 pounds of nylon line 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.640
 In accordance with that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.570
 I can not afford it 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.140
 Lightly and slowly 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.580
 Laugh book setting and so on 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.670
 It is broken by saying 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.429
 First of all in the case of ecd 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.760
 Well first of all from 63 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.220
 I think I will handle morning market 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.050
 mylyn is doing the original setting though 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.280
 Even this Midori dance set as usual 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.360
 With a spoon 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.550
 Morning market established 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.970
 Look for a high fish 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 If you settle down with it like this, this time 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 Well, the farthest away of the students in the distance 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.940
 Or if it is near the front and there is a fish running up, it is lighter 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.110
 It's a good idea to tackle with a tackle no matter which way it swings 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 Along with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.739
 Centered on this middle 63 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.659
 It is the setting of us that we use moving blades
