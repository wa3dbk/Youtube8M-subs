in<00:00:03.170> this<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.680> will<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:05.040> making<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.549> mini

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
in this video I will be making a mini

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.030 
in this video I will be making a mini
spud<00:00:06.150> gun<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.690> shoots<00:00:06.930> bb's<00:00:07.379> or<00:00:07.740> anything

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
spud gun that shoots bb's or anything

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.100 
spud gun that shoots bb's or anything
net<00:00:08.340> fits<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.700> barrel<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.510> power<00:00:09.780> and

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
net fits in barrel with power and

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.240 
net fits in barrel with power and
precision<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:12.170> first<00:00:13.170> started<00:00:13.590> by<00:00:13.769> taking<00:00:14.130> an

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
precision I first started by taking an

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
precision I first started by taking an
empty<00:00:14.400> supplement<00:00:15.030> bottle<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.690> think

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
empty supplement bottle that I think

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.240 
empty supplement bottle that I think
would<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.139> strong<00:00:16.500> enough<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> hold<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
would be strong enough to hold the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.160 
would be strong enough to hold the
pressure<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.210> combustion<00:00:18.600> created

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
pressure of the combustion created

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.519 
pressure of the combustion created
wildfire<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:20.449> then<00:00:21.449> drilled<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.930> small<00:00:21.960> hole<00:00:22.199> on

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
wildfire I then drilled a small hole on

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.740 
wildfire I then drilled a small hole on
the<00:00:22.680> cap<00:00:22.859> it'll<00:00:23.609> make<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> small<00:00:24.119> straw<00:00:24.390> fit<00:00:24.630> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the cap it'll make a small straw fit in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.000 
the cap it'll make a small straw fit in
perfectly<00:00:26.449> the<00:00:27.449> straws<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.170> were<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.590> 18

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
perfectly the straws I use were about 18

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
perfectly the straws I use were about 18
centimeters<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.449> taped<00:00:30.720> them<00:00:30.990> together

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
centimeters on and I taped them together

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.600 
centimeters on and I taped them together
I<00:00:36.440> didn't<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.680> any<00:00:37.890> pressure<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.370> escape

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I didn't want any pressure to escape

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
I didn't want any pressure to escape
anywhere<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> trough<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.140> maximum

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
anywhere but from the trough for maximum

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
anywhere but from the trough for maximum
power<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> glued<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> straw<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> cap<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
power so I glued the straw to the cap to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.810 
power so I glued the straw to the cap to
make<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> seal<00:00:45.829> since<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.309> using<00:00:47.460> some

chamber<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.930> loading<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:57.949> after<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
chamber when loading it after that I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.950 
chamber when loading it after that I
wrapped<00:00:59.940> some<00:01:00.059> duct<00:01:00.390> tape<00:01:00.600> around<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
wrapped some duct tape around the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
wrapped some duct tape around the
chamber<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.559> reinforce<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.370> anything<00:01:02.850> bad

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
chamber to reinforce it if anything bad

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.560 
chamber to reinforce it if anything bad
happens<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> looks<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
happens and also for the looks of it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
happens and also for the looks of it
then<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> took<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> BBQ<00:01:07.439> igniter<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.280> glued<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
then I took a BBQ igniter and glued it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.890 
then I took a BBQ igniter and glued it
to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> chamber<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> source<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> ignition

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.230 

and<00:01:13.990> made<00:01:14.740> two<00:01:14.980> holes<00:01:15.190> on<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> side<00:01:15.760> put<00:01:16.120> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and made two holes on the side put the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.180 
and made two holes on the side put the
wires<00:01:16.420> in<00:01:22.050> after<00:01:23.050> putting<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.500> wires<00:01:23.680> in<00:01:23.980> and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
wires in after putting the wires in and

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.400 
wires in after putting the wires in and
gluing<00:01:24.580> them<00:01:24.730> in<00:01:24.880> place<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.900> can<00:01:26.080> see<00:01:26.260> that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
gluing them in place you can see that

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.440 
gluing them in place you can see that
when<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.620> press<00:01:26.860> on<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.100> igniter<00:01:27.550> makes<00:01:28.120> a<00:01:28.240> nice

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
when I press on the igniter makes a nice

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.760 
when I press on the igniter makes a nice
blue<00:01:28.810> spark<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.720> straws<00:01:32.020> were<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.320> little<00:01:32.650> bit

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
blue spark the straws were a little bit

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.800 
blue spark the straws were a little bit
curved<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:33.820> added<00:01:34.060> some<00:01:34.210> tape<00:01:34.540> on<00:01:34.690> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
curved so I added some tape on the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.220 
curved so I added some tape on the
straws<00:01:35.080> to<00:01:35.470> make<00:01:35.500> them<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.860> bit<00:01:36.130> straighter<00:01:37.230> and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230

also<00:01:38.560> some<00:01:38.770> tape<00:01:38.980> on<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.370> bottom<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
also some tape on the bottom of the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.890 
also some tape on the bottom of the
bottle<00:01:40.300> to<00:01:40.720> reinforce<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.910> then<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:43.210> added<00:01:43.600> a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
bottle to reinforce it then I added a

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.410 
bottle to reinforce it then I added a
red<00:01:44.170> dot<00:01:44.380> sight<00:01:44.680> for<00:01:44.980> better<00:01:45.130> aiming<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.730> make

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
red dot sight for better aiming and make

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:57.510 
red dot sight for better aiming and make
it<00:01:46.570> look<00:01:46.720> tactical<00:01:55.890> after<00:01:56.890> spraying<00:01:57.250> some

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520
