this<00:00:06.120> star<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.890> bit<00:00:07.890> easier<00:00:08.340> than<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> first

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
this star is a bit easier than the first

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.150 
this star is a bit easier than the first
but<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.540> still<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.200> very<00:00:10.559> skillful

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the first time in this video so we can

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080 
the first time in this video so we can
just<00:00:19.080> go<00:00:19.230> ahead<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> ignore<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.789> part

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.980 
just go ahead and ignore the first part
of<00:00:21.150> it

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
just let you know that this galaxy is a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750 
just let you know that this galaxy is a
bit<00:00:33.150> tricky<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.840> those<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.400> haven't<00:00:35.400> played

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
bit tricky for those that haven't played

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.660 
bit tricky for those that haven't played
it<00:00:35.970> and<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:37.110> those<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.559> play<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.489> know

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it and for those that do play you know

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.320 
it and for those that do play you know
how<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.540> tricky<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:39.989> isn't<00:00:40.379> sometimes<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.940> go

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
how how tricky it isn't sometimes to go

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.770 
how how tricky it isn't sometimes to go
down<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.040> rainbow<00:00:44.040> path<00:00:44.480> past<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> beginning

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
down the rainbow path past the beginning

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.710 
down the rainbow path past the beginning
because<00:00:46.650> you<00:00:46.769> got<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.040> know<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.970> ain't

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
because you got to know where to ain't

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.710 
because you got to know where to ain't
to<00:00:49.110> turn<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.620> wheel<00:00:49.860> emote<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.540> your

to turn your wheel emote so that your

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:02.690 
to turn your wheel emote so that your
ball<00:00:52.410> won't<00:00:52.710> roll<00:00:52.890> off<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.040> edge<00:01:01.190> careful<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
ball won't roll off the edge careful of

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.910 
ball won't roll off the edge careful of
goombas<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> bomb<00:01:04.140> bombs

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.380 

no<00:01:09.640> all<00:01:10.000> my<00:01:10.030> coins

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.400 

so<00:01:15.050> like<00:01:15.260> right<00:01:15.410> here<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.700> tilt<00:01:17.270> your

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
so like right here you have to tilt your

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.220 
so like right here you have to tilt your
Wiimote<00:01:18.410> maybe<00:01:19.340> ed<00:01:19.610> up<00:01:19.760> in<00:01:19.910> 45-degree<00:01:20.870> angle

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
Wiimote maybe ed up in 45-degree angle

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.510 
Wiimote maybe ed up in 45-degree angle
or<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:22.400> enough<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:24.620> know<00:01:24.740> it's

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
or so just enough so that you know it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.650 
or so just enough so that you know it's
twisted<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.330> tilted<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.930> left<00:01:28.660> it's

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
twisted it's tilted to the left it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.890 
twisted it's tilted to the left it's
kind<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.990> explained<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.450> get<00:01:32.660> it<00:01:32.780> with

kind of explained but you get it with

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.789 
kind of explained but you get it with
trial<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.229> error

you have to just roll out and grab a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.399 
you have to just roll out and grab a
star<00:01:49.880> but<00:01:50.240> barely<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:50.630> missed<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:56.409> now

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409

star but barely I missed it and now
comes<00:01:57.709> second<00:01:58.340> turn

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.290 

as<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.210> record<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:13.110> only<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:14.010> get

as I record this I only have to get

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.730 
as I record this I only have to get
seven<00:02:15.300> more<00:02:15.450> stars<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.990> I'll<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.410> able<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
seven more stars and I'll be able to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.380 
seven more stars and I'll be able to
finish<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.310> game<00:02:19.400> but<00:02:20.400> there's<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.970> little<00:02:21.270> bit

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
finish the game but there's a little bit

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.150 
finish the game but there's a little bit
more<00:02:21.420> afterwards<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.470> won't<00:02:22.650> say<00:02:22.770> exactly<00:02:22.950> what

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
more afterwards I won't say exactly what

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.650 
more afterwards I won't say exactly what
it's<00:02:26.160> nothing<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.760> requires<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> go<00:02:27.570> out

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
it's nothing that requires you to go out

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.350 
it's nothing that requires you to go out
and<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.840> more<00:02:28.080> stars<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.970> know<00:02:30.090> I'd<00:02:30.240> have

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
and get more stars and you know I'd have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.830 
and get more stars and you know I'd have
in<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.800> big<00:02:32.010> amount<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.640> guess<00:02:35.570> you'll<00:02:36.570> see<00:02:36.780> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
in a big amount I guess you'll see you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.089 
in a big amount I guess you'll see you
know<00:02:37.230> since<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.220> record<00:02:38.580> it

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.039 

once<00:02:45.610> again<00:02:45.849> be<00:02:46.030> sure<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.360> tilt<00:02:46.599> your<00:02:46.629> remote

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
once again be sure you tilt your remote

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.839 
once again be sure you tilt your remote
so<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.290> don't<00:02:47.470> fall<00:02:47.680> off<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.950> edge<00:02:48.099> cause<00:02:48.670> you

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
so you don't fall off the edge cause you

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.309 
so you don't fall off the edge cause you
will<00:02:48.939> fall<00:02:49.269> off<00:02:49.420> you're<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> right

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
will fall off you're not going the right

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:58.940 
will fall off you're not going the right
angle<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:53.189> almost<00:02:54.189> fell<00:02:54.430> off<00:02:54.519> right<00:02:54.610> there<00:02:54.879> -

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.020 

all<00:02:59.950> right<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:01.360> I'm<00:03:01.569> wrong<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.819> prefer<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.940> go

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
all right so if I'm wrong I prefer to go

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:17.100 
all right so if I'm wrong I prefer to go
slow<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.599> guess<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.590> miss<00:03:06.310> all

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.020 

there's<00:03:17.620> no<00:03:17.740> really<00:03:18.040> way<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> slow<00:03:18.610> down<00:03:18.820> here

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
there's no really way to slow down here
