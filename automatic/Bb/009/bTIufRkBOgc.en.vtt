as<00:00:01.350> we<00:00:01.500> have<00:00:01.650> done<00:00:01.829> anything<00:00:02.010> vaguely

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
as we have done anything vaguely

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.280 
as we have done anything vaguely
psychopathic<00:00:03.240> for<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> while<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
psychopathic for a while this is the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.070 
psychopathic for a while this is the
2-liter<00:00:05.299> turbocharged<00:00:06.299> engine<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
2-liter turbocharged engine that is

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.440 
2-liter turbocharged engine that is
about<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.680> be<00:00:07.859> or<00:00:08.220> will<00:00:08.639> eventually<00:00:09.300> be

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
about to be or will eventually be

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.900 
about to be or will eventually be
installed<00:00:09.929> on<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.769> new<00:00:10.950> buggy<00:00:11.280> which<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.880> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
installed on the new buggy which is a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.169 
installed on the new buggy which is a
project<00:00:12.300> stumper<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:14.280> engines<00:00:14.639> pretty<00:00:15.000> much

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
project stumper the engines pretty much

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210 
project stumper the engines pretty much
complete<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> front<00:00:16.320> subframe<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:17.039> just

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
complete with the front subframe we just

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.980 
complete with the front subframe we just
removed<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.880> from<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> front<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> car

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
removed it from the front of the car

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.890 
removed it from the front of the car
because<00:00:19.500> obviously<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.580> want<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.000> much<00:00:21.180> intact

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
because obviously we want as much intact

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.189 
because obviously we want as much intact
as<00:00:22.260> possible<00:00:22.550> right<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.510> engine<00:00:25.080> management

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
as possible right the engine management

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.910 
as possible right the engine management
is<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:25.920> connected<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> fuel<00:00:28.470> systems

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
is all connected up the fuel systems

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.150 
is all connected up the fuel systems
connected<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> pump<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> jerrycan

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
connected up with a pump from a jerrycan

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:41.150 
connected up with a pump from a jerrycan
so<00:00:32.210> let's<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.390> if<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.570> works<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so let's see if it works that is a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.610 
so let's see if it works that is a
Syrian<00:00:41.579> who<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.850> find<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> Spade<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
Syrian who can find the Spade on the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:53.330 
Syrian who can find the Spade on the
starter<00:00:43.950> motor<00:00:50.930> assuming<00:00:51.930> laws<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.680> assuming

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
starter motor assuming laws but assuming

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.389 
starter motor assuming laws but assuming
the<00:00:53.460> battery<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.820> not<00:00:53.969> flat<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:58.399> backby

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the battery is not flat here is backby

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.860 
the battery is not flat here is backby
flat

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.860 

do<00:01:02.870> it<00:01:03.080> just<00:01:03.380> check<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.710> earth<00:01:03.800> clamps<00:01:04.250> on<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
do it just check the earth clamps on the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.310 
do it just check the earth clamps on the
is<00:01:05.870> well<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.320> truly<00:01:06.380> on<00:01:06.680> something<00:01:08.080> yeah<00:01:09.080> get

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
is well and truly on something yeah get
