00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.090
 fast blue cross with blue pachuca the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.090
 player to the child 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.700
 and now 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.010
 player a year because he promoted an injunction 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.730
 then federal 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:29.039
 Y 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:32.720
 and that part was modified in football 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.830
 at 16 18 35 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.590
 and now that the party is celebrating 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.590
 the players on the court 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.039
 this is a serious situation 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.309
 dedicated to situations 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.309
 at this time 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.190
 of vision is analyzing the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 consequences of this situation of doing 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 all known if you analyze the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 statute of the Mexican federation of 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 football and virtually all 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 federations in the world and that derive 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.580
 of the fifa statute there has been agreed 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.460
 since always the decisions of the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.000
 football are taken inside football not 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.100
 outside of football in that sense the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 football has its rules that are 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 accepted by all affiliates in the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.200
 when applying for membership the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.700
 fact that yesterday the player 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 have played and the club has accepted 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.320
 that the player will play that is the point 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.530
 important in this 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.330
 derived from the player requested low 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 full right to the authority 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.180
 correspondent 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.130
 boasting to the authority that the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.710
 Mexican soccer federation was 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.560
 preventing you from doing your activity 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.820
 professional savior asked the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 authority that the Mexican federation of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.490
 football was preventing him from exercising his 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 activity 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.390
 the judge met the same day yesterday 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.570
 amparo that they promoted yesterday and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.830
 the same day yesterday the judge ruled out 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.110
 that granted a temporary suspension and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.290
 that based on that is the legal part 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.410
 the blue cross club determined that the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.150
 player could play the save to save 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.300
 the cÃ¡rmenes against the federation 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.330
 Mexican soccer commission without 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.069
 primary will be disease and all 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.239
 documentation 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.989
 a scenario is precisely that of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.450
 having incurred a fault 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.670
 Regulation of improper alignment of 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.230
 a new player eligible to be able 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 participate the consequence 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.920
 what regulation 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.400
 implies in that case is the loss of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.890
 match and phase elimination 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.319
 end of the league to the club that has 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.940
 committed said lack of regulation 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.310
 that is what can happen 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.740
 economic or commercial conditions 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.080
 are not part of the regulation I do not think 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.500
 that are considered by the commission 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.500
 cyclical
