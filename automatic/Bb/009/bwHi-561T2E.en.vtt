00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.789
 reveals the cyclist's attitude towards the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.920
 insecurity 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.719
 thieves usually steal at the beginning of

 carrying other stolen bicycle 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.140
 two bandits were already there with another 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.360
 bike they try to escape through the gate 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 but they can not go out 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.009

 victims of bandits 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 this is because they usually run with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 imported bicycles which are generally 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.649

 São Paulo started to ride more than bike 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.350
 expensive this as perverse effect ends 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.360
 generating a parallel market for parts that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.970
 makes it catch the attention of
