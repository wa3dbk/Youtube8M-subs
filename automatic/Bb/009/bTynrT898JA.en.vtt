00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.240
 hogar the wheel arch of the spokes board 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.069
 anterior to the ray board 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.749
 90% of them are on the right side and on the left side they are the same 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.289
 clearly it can vary a bit because of the disc clearly on the side 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.599
 of the disc there will be a camber differently from the opposite side 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.800
 so you can you will notice that maybe display rays and the part towards the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.820
 speech not voting pensioners on the other hand are a little less retired this 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 it does not matter 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 what can happen can happen though in the back part in the part 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.370
 back where the camber water is completely different because it was one 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.400
 part we have 9 pinions on the other side we have only one disk we have until 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.810
 varied 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.670
 different people set aside what happens on the side of the pinions and pirates 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 I'm definitely retired 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.110
 while on the other side I am - dictionary 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.300
 it may happen that it breaks or radio usually breaks off from the side 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 where there are more pensioners 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.060
 that is from the side of the unibo pines 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.960
 remember 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.030
 the rounding on the side of the pines once back 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.650
 from to roundness 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.050
 as far as the wheel is concerned 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.660
 when we vote for the wheel 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.440
 searching trabace ground to make it round we should never undergoing 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.620
 assembly pull the opposite spokes and sprockets but we have to pull the spokes from the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.490
 part of the sprockets when the wheel will be perfectly round in this case in 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.820
 assembly phase 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 we will go to bell marconi raggi opposti weekly seventh nimbus 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.990
 it can happen that a clearly radius 80% radius is broken 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.900
 part hypinions 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.390
 how we must behave we replace ray clearly you know how 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.170
 disassemble cover we will avenge after how to disassemble the sprocket 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.240
 introduces incorrectly inserted terrarium in the appropriate nib ers at this point the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.540
 I recommend our r 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.550
 turn the only one that is broken ie insert it pull with the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.850
 your draws this and try to right the wheel 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.729
 and so my ears are 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:22.559
 the capital is more possible then to go to an expert to speak central 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.689
 perfectly but don't go to touch the other trips because maybe then you 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.780
 you can straighten the wheel 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.869
 that is with regards to 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.679
 characterize your right and left word will make you oval 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.449
 what that 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.299
 not much 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.339
 it's a good year because it's clearly when you ride 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:42.839
 and those parts to assault
