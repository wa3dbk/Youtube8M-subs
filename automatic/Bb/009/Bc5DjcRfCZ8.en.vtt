that's<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.789> back<00:00:17.910> side<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:20.840> did<00:00:21.840> use<00:00:22.279> to<00:00:23.279> glue

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
otherwise the whole ornament doesn't

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.389 
otherwise the whole ornament doesn't
take<00:00:28.230> any<00:00:28.439> adhesive<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.480> let's<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.750> started

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
take any adhesive so let's get started

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.440 
take any adhesive so let's get started
and<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.759> first<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.360> you'll<00:00:33.540> need<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.110> eight

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and the first thing you'll need is eight

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.080 
and the first thing you'll need is eight
squares<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.870> paper<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.620> cut<00:00:38.010> mine<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.820> by

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
squares of paper I cut mine three by

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
squares of paper I cut mine three by
three<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:42.170> this<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.950> green<00:00:44.250> side<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
three and this is this green side is the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.770 
three and this is this green side is the
right<00:00:45.510> side<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.980> red<00:00:47.160> side<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.600> wrong

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
right side and the red side is the wrong

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.979 
right side and the red side is the wrong
so<00:00:49.200> we're<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:50.090> fold<00:00:51.090> across<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> right

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so we're going to fold across the right

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.090 
so we're going to fold across the right
side<00:00:52.320> diagonally<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.530> score<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.859> our

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
side diagonally and score it with our

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.340 
side diagonally and score it with our
bone<00:00:59.640> folder<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.359> we've<00:01:00.449> got<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> nice<00:01:00.899> flat

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bone folder so we've got a nice flat

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.719 
bone folder so we've got a nice flat
fold<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.860> we're<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> open<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> up

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
fold then we're going to open that up

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.500 
fold then we're going to open that up
and<00:01:06.500> fold<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> top<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> crease<00:01:09.180> line

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and fold the top down to the crease line

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.749 
and fold the top down to the crease line
and<00:01:15.200> then<00:01:16.200> fold<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.650> close<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.700> we

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and then fold that back close now we

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.350 
and then fold that back close now we
will<00:01:18.270> fold<00:01:18.509> down<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.810> other<00:01:19.170> side

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.880 

and<00:01:26.360> then<00:01:26.780> this<00:01:27.050> little<00:01:27.380> corner<00:01:27.620> gets<00:01:27.920> folded

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
and then this little corner gets folded

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.610 
and then this little corner gets folded
towards<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.750> other<00:01:32.900> corner<00:01:33.290> gets

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
towards you and the other corner gets

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.640 
towards you and the other corner gets
folded<00:01:35.620> behind<00:01:36.620> and<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:38.780> do<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.140> until<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
folded behind and you do that until you

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.310 
folded behind and you do that until you
have<00:01:39.770> eight<00:01:40.340> pieces<00:01:40.760> who<00:01:41.270> assemble<00:01:41.750> them<00:01:44.320> like

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
have eight pieces who assemble them like

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.740 
have eight pieces who assemble them like
this<00:01:46.930> slide<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:47.960> down<00:01:48.940> then<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:50.150> one<00:01:50.450> goes

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
this slide that down then this one goes

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.870 
this slide that down then this one goes
into<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.500> pocket<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> last<00:01:52.280> one<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
into the pocket of the last one and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.330 
into the pocket of the last one and
you'll<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.510> way<00:01:53.630> around<00:01:57.340> in

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you'll do that all the way around in

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:10.270 
you'll do that all the way around in
there

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:24.559 

you

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.119 

might<00:02:25.569> take<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.079> adjusting<00:02:26.769> at<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:26.950> end

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
might take a little adjusting at the end

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.830 
might take a little adjusting at the end
to<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.489> everything<00:02:27.730> back<00:02:28.030> where<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.420> started

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
to get everything back where you started

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.280

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
from and there you have it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.559 
from and there you have it
