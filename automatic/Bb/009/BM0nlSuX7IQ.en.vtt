this is just a short video to give a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.110 
this is just a short video to give a
couple<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.240> notes<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.779> what<00:00:07.020> might<00:00:07.259> help<00:00:07.589> you

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
couple of notes on what might help you

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.580 
couple of notes on what might help you
puppeteer<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.330> eyes<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.019> program<00:00:10.410> your

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
puppeteer your eyes and program your

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259 
puppeteer your eyes and program your
eyes<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.280> look<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.580> little<00:00:11.759> bit<00:00:12.000> more

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
eyes to look a little bit more

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.650 
eyes to look a little bit more
human-like<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.230> passes<00:00:13.740> real<00:00:14.370> rather<00:00:15.269> than

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
human-like and passes real rather than

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.689 
human-like and passes real rather than
robotic<00:00:16.590> if<00:00:16.830> that's<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.340> you're<00:00:17.460> shooting

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
robotic if that's what you're shooting

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.750 
robotic if that's what you're shooting
for<00:00:18.740> everybody<00:00:19.740> has<00:00:19.920> their<00:00:20.100> own<00:00:20.130> way<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.490> doing

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
for everybody has their own way of doing

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.730 
for everybody has their own way of doing
things<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.630> take<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.439> it's

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
things and so take it for what it's

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310 
things and so take it for what it's
worth<00:00:23.300> these<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.630> some<00:00:25.019> things<00:00:25.080> that

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
worth these are just some things that

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.429 
worth these are just some things that
I've<00:00:25.470> learned<00:00:25.500> over<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.130> years<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.939> really

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
I've learned over the years so really

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
I've learned over the years so really
one<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.560> keys<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.460> eyes<00:00:29.670> rarely<00:00:30.359> if

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
one of the keys is that eyes rarely if

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.580 
one of the keys is that eyes rarely if
ever<00:00:31.500> move<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> smooth<00:00:33.210> left<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.110> right<00:00:34.320> or

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
ever move and a smooth left and right or

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.970 
ever move and a smooth left and right or
opened<00:00:35.010> down<00:00:35.160> fashion<00:00:35.899> it's<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.620> like

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
opened down fashion it's much more like

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.729 
opened down fashion it's much more like
a<00:00:38.610> perfect<00:00:39.239> case<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.690> point<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> look

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
a perfect case in point is if you look

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
a perfect case in point is if you look
at<00:00:40.920> Arnold<00:00:41.399> Schwarzenegger<00:00:42.090> zycze<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
at Arnold Schwarzenegger zycze in the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
at Arnold Schwarzenegger zycze in the
terminator<00:00:43.530> he<00:00:44.280> made<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.360> conscious

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
terminator he made a very conscious

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.549 
terminator he made a very conscious
effort<00:00:46.910> while<00:00:47.910> acting<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> role<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.260> make

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
effort while acting that role to make

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.220 
effort while acting that role to make
his<00:00:49.800> eyes<00:00:50.010> sweep<00:00:50.910> left<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.690> right<00:00:51.930> without

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
his eyes sweep left and right without

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.639 
his eyes sweep left and right without
stopping<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.219> very<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.379> watch<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
stopping or very much so if you watch it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040 
stopping or very much so if you watch it
closely<00:00:56.070> you'll<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.820> he's<00:00:57.390> sweeping<00:00:57.719> like

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
closely you'll see it he's sweeping like

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.860 
closely you'll see it he's sweeping like
a<00:00:58.079> scanner<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.969> it<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
a scanner and it does look like a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
a scanner and it does look like a
perfect<00:01:01.379> cyborg<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.070> did<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> great<00:01:02.489> job<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
perfect cyborg it did a great job if you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
perfect cyborg it did a great job if you
want<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.010> okay

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
want that look that's how you do it okay

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
want that look that's how you do it okay
if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> real

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
if you want to have it look like a real

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
if you want to have it look like a real
human<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:09.630> very<00:01:09.659> fake<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
human that's going to look very fake and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
human that's going to look very fake and
if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.340> believe<00:01:11.549> me<00:01:11.700> watch<00:01:11.880> The

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
if you don't believe me watch The

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.490 
if you don't believe me watch The
Terminator<00:01:12.270> it'll<00:01:12.990> show<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
Terminator it'll show up right there so

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.590 
Terminator it'll show up right there so
look<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.740> example<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.400> real<00:01:17.850> quick<00:01:18.210> quick

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
look at an example just real quick quick

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.510 
look at an example just real quick quick
video<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.619> eyes<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.780> see<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> I

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
video of my eyes and see how the I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
video of my eyes and see how the I
naturally<00:01:23.520> locks<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.270> two<00:01:24.509> separate<00:01:24.930> objects

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
naturally locks on two separate objects

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.219 
naturally locks on two separate objects
as<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> moves<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.479> move<00:01:27.720> stop

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as it moves it's more of a move stop

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.219 
as it moves it's more of a move stop
move<00:01:28.799> stop<00:01:29.130> type<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.909> scenario<00:01:30.229> now

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
move stop type of scenario now

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
move stop type of scenario now
something's<00:01:31.770> moving<00:01:32.090> across<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> room<00:01:33.630> for

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
something's moving across the room for

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.620 
something's moving across the room for
example<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:35.640> still<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> very<00:01:36.210> slight

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
example there's still a very slight

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.830 
example there's still a very slight
stepper<00:01:37.500> type<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:38.130> motion<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.790> eye<00:01:38.909> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
stepper type of motion to the eye it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.230 
stepper type of motion to the eye it's
very<00:01:40.229> very<00:01:40.740> very<00:01:41.009> rare<00:01:41.369> you'll<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> nice

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
very very very rare you'll see a nice

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.350 
very very very rare you'll see a nice
slow<00:01:43.220> movement<00:01:44.220> something's<00:01:44.820> coming<00:01:45.090> out<00:01:45.329> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
slow movement something's coming out of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.109 
slow movement something's coming out of
a<00:01:45.540> coma<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.079> something<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.250> it's

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
a coma or something like that so it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.990 
a coma or something like that so it's
kind<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.450> counterintuitive<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
kind of counterintuitive but in this is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
kind of counterintuitive but in this is
case<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.259> those<00:01:52.439> where<00:01:52.710> jerking

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
case it's one of those where jerking

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.330 
case it's one of those where jerking
motion<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.320> natural<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
motion is actually more natural to the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.069 
motion is actually more natural to the
human<00:01:56.700> form<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.649> just<00:01:58.649> keep<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.040> mind

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
human form so just keep it in mind

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
human form so just keep it in mind
practicing<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.340> key<00:02:02.540> it's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
practicing this is really the key it's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.020 
practicing this is really the key it's
practicing<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.439> hours<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:05.189> RC

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
practicing for hours on your RC

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.930 
practicing for hours on your RC
transmitter<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:07.170> tweaking<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.190> code<00:02:08.610> if

transmitter or tweaking your code if
you're<00:02:09.569> doing<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.229> way<00:02:10.819> just<00:02:11.819> watch

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
you're doing it that way just watch

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.910 
you're doing it that way just watch
carefully<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> most

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
carefully it's not just the most

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640 
carefully it's not just the most
of<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.160> eye<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.790> really<00:02:15.450> important<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.440> is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
of the eye but really important to is

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.800 
of the eye but really important to is
how<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.980> eyes<00:02:17.250> blink<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.030> when<00:02:18.239> they<00:02:18.480> blink

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
how the eyes blink and when they blink

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.260 
how the eyes blink and when they blink
it's<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.890> always<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.340> hundred<00:02:20.640> percent<00:02:20.760> too

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's not always a hundred percent too

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.780 
it's not always a hundred percent too
it's<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> slam<00:02:22.230> shut<00:02:22.770> blink<00:02:23.190> every<00:02:23.550> time

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it's not a slam shut blink every time

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.190 
it's not a slam shut blink every time
sometimes<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.900> squint<00:02:25.319> just<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.489> or

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
sometimes we squint just a little bit or

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.300 
sometimes we squint just a little bit or
have<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.770> partial<00:02:29.400> close<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:31.319> shut

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
have a kind of a partial close I shut

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.750 
have a kind of a partial close I shut
that<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:33.330> be<00:02:33.450> very<00:02:33.690> fast<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.620> might<00:02:35.190> look

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
that can be very fast and might look

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.680 
that can be very fast and might look
like<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.060> blink<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.590> not<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.830> total<00:02:38.280> blink<00:02:38.850> so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
like a blink but is not a total blink so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.559 
like a blink but is not a total blink so
many<00:02:40.380> times<00:02:40.650> you'll<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.280> whole<00:02:41.730> huge<00:02:42.209> blink

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
many times you'll see a whole huge blink

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.300 
many times you'll see a whole huge blink
one<00:02:42.750> hundred<00:02:42.989> percent<00:02:43.019> when<00:02:43.709> they're<00:02:43.890> large

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
one hundred percent when they're large

see something out of the corner of your
eye<00:02:49.940> many<00:02:50.940> times<00:02:51.239> you'll<00:02:51.810> blink<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.620> your<00:02:52.739> eye

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769

to<00:03:58.079> all<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.950> practice<00:03:59.579> practice<00:03:59.819> and

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to all of this is practice practice and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.890 
to all of this is practice practice and
practice<00:04:01.519> once<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.640> have<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> solid<00:04:03.209> stable

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
mechanism that you can rely on and you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.750 
mechanism that you can rely on and you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
have a solid control system that you can

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.699 
have a solid control system that you can
rely<00:04:09.060> on<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.780> only<00:04:09.810> thing<00:04:10.049> that's<00:04:10.380> going

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
rely on then the only thing that's going

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.729 
rely on then the only thing that's going
to<00:04:10.769> screw<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.639> you<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.900> that's<00:04:13.319> where<00:04:13.620> it

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
to screw it up is you so that's where it

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.819 
to screw it up is you so that's where it
is<00:04:13.859> down<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.519> practice<00:04:15.060> part<00:04:15.650> wish<00:04:16.650> you
