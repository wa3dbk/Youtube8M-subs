00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
it's a bread pan so I just basically

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.510 
it's a bread pan so I just basically
pull<00:03:28.510> out<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.530> kind<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.130> make<00:03:30.489> it

out snapping sound which is kind of

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.540 
out snapping sound which is kind of
scary

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
scary

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.780 
scary
so<00:03:34.180> inside<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> bread<00:03:35.230> pan<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.430> what<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.110 
so inside a bread pan this is what a
kneading<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:41.050> inside<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:42.100> cup<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.550> measuring

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
kneading and inside is a cup a measuring

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.350 
kneading and inside is a cup a measuring
cup

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
cup

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760 
cup
just<00:03:44.170> open<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.620> up

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.470 

so<00:03:48.770> this<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.550> measuring<00:03:50.390> spoon<00:03:52.240> it's<00:03:53.240> a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
so this is the measuring spoon it's a

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.130 
so this is the measuring spoon it's a
measuring<00:03:54.140> cup<00:03:57.490> this<00:03:58.490> is<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.760> pin<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.900> remove

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
measuring cup this is a pin to remove

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.930 
measuring cup this is a pin to remove
the<00:04:02.440> kneading<00:04:03.440> tool<00:04:03.680> I'm<00:04:03.980> not<00:04:04.520> sure<00:04:04.610> how<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.790> do

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
the kneading tool I'm not sure how to do

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.300 
the kneading tool I'm not sure how to do
that<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.270> I<00:04:05.300> just<00:04:05.390> want<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.960> rip<00:04:06.110> this<00:04:06.350> out<00:04:06.620> and

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
that so I just want to rip this out and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.540 
that so I just want to rip this out and
I'm<00:04:07.460> sure<00:04:07.730> there's<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.030> way<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:09.280> be<00:04:10.280> able<00:04:10.370> to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
I'm sure there's a way to be able to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.530 
I'm sure there's a way to be able to
remove<00:04:11.060> it<00:04:12.460> so<00:04:13.460> this<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:13.760> something<00:04:14.330> that<00:04:14.450> you

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
remove it so this is something that you

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.180 
remove it so this is something that you
put<00:04:14.690> into<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.170> bread<00:04:15.350> machine<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.890> this<00:04:15.950> will

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
put into the bread machine and this will

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:25.030 
put into the bread machine and this will
knead<00:04:16.520> the<00:04:17.170> flour<00:04:23.320> after<00:04:24.320> reading<00:04:24.800> the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
knead the flour after reading the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.060 
knead the flour after reading the
instructions<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:26.140> was<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:27.290> proud<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.800> figure

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
instructions I was so proud to figure

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.040 
instructions I was so proud to figure
out<00:04:28.130> basically<00:04:28.400> or<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.270> kneading<00:04:29.600> tool<00:04:29.810> you

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
out basically or this kneading tool you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.250 
out basically or this kneading tool you
just<00:04:30.080> pop<00:04:30.530> in<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.250> middle<00:04:31.870> there's<00:04:32.870> a<00:04:32.960> hole

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
just pop in in the middle there's a hole

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.650 
just pop in in the middle there's a hole
and<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.680> thing<00:04:33.830> as<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> half<00:04:34.250> kind<00:04:35.000> of<00:04:35.060> half

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
and this thing as a half kind of half

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.680 
and this thing as a half kind of half
circle<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:37.370> just<00:04:37.400> basically<00:04:37.940> put<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.480> so

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
circle you just basically put it in so

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.460 
circle you just basically put it in so
there's<00:04:38.900> no<00:04:39.080> way<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.710> get<00:04:40.670> it<00:04:40.790> wrong<00:04:41.320> came<00:04:42.320> with

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
there's no way to get it wrong came with

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.120 
there's no way to get it wrong came with
this<00:04:42.620> tool<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.910> don't<00:04:44.360> see<00:04:45.140> any<00:04:45.320> use<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.980> I

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
this tool I don't see any use of it I

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.610 
this tool I don't see any use of it I
think<00:04:46.190> in<00:04:46.490> maybe<00:04:46.790> once<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.780> bread<00:04:48.260> is<00:04:48.380> cook

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
think in maybe once the bread is cook

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.970 
think in maybe once the bread is cook
you<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:49.270> I'll<00:04:50.270> bake<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:51.410> use<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:51.800> -

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
you just I'll bake you use this -

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.500 
you just I'll bake you use this -
priority<00:04:52.490> -<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.060> I'm<00:04:53.210> not<00:04:53.420> so<00:04:53.570> sure<00:04:53.600> yet<00:04:55.510> there

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
priority - so I'm not so sure yet there

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.690 
priority - so I'm not so sure yet there
are<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.630> couple<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:57.050> negatives<00:04:57.800> that<00:04:57.950> I<00:04:58.160> think<00:04:58.610> I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
are a couple of negatives that I think I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.360 
are a couple of negatives that I think I
want<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.970> point<00:04:59.480> out<00:04:59.630> the<00:05:00.500> first<00:05:00.680> one<00:05:00.950> is<00:05:01.130> this

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
want to point out the first one is this

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.770 
want to point out the first one is this
bread<00:05:01.730> pan<00:05:03.280> you<00:05:04.280> have<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.520> put<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.850> in<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.330> it

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
bread pan you have to put it in and it

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
bread pan you have to put it in and it
makes<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.290> loud<00:05:06.830> noise<00:05:06.890> so<00:05:07.850> that<00:05:08.660> that's<00:05:09.380> kind

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
makes a loud noise so that that's kind

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.070 
makes a loud noise so that that's kind
of<00:05:09.860> scary<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.640> should<00:05:10.880> push<00:05:11.060> it<00:05:11.090> as<00:05:11.960> you

of scary and you should push it as you
can<00:05:12.200> see<00:05:13.450> came<00:05:14.450> with<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:14.750> tool<00:05:15.050> I<00:05:15.290> don't<00:05:15.410> any

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
can see came with this tool I don't any

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.490 
can see came with this tool I don't any
find<00:05:16.430> any<00:05:16.580> useful<00:05:17.120> until<00:05:17.480> I<00:05:17.540> actually<00:05:17.690> start

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
using the bread machine it came with a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.020 
using the bread machine it came with a
set<00:05:22.370> of<00:05:22.520> instructions<00:05:24.220> unless<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:25.640> really
