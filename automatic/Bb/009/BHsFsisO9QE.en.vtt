00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
plastic gen used in tournaments like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.039 
plastic gen used in tournaments like
24/7<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> weight<00:01:41.610> discs

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
24/7 and it's so good and weight discs

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.889 
24/7 and it's so good and weight discs
it's<00:01:43.049> ten<00:01:43.560> wide<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.520> super<00:01:45.090> super<00:01:45.420> super

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740 
they make see what else we got we got
the<00:01:50.280> engine<00:01:50.430> gear<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> instant

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the engine gear so this is the instant

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.039 
the engine gear so this is the instant
one<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.579> supposedly<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.970> instant<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
one so supposedly the instant that you

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.480 
one so supposedly the instant that you
launch<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> beyblade<00:01:55.619> disco<00:01:56.100> kicks<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
angles

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.090 
angles
then<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.910> just<00:01:58.940> goes<00:01:59.180> ham<00:01:59.480> okay<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.830> then<00:02:01.010> we

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
then it just goes ham okay and then we

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.480 
then it just goes ham okay and then we
have<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.250> bass<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.900> yeah<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.260> let's<00:02:03.830> put<00:02:04.370> on

what the Babli is going so John's is a
right<00:02:47.420> spin<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.410> engine<00:02:48.680> gear<00:02:48.800> goes

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
right spin and then the engine gear goes

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.470 
right spin and then the engine gear goes
left<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:49.550> it's<00:02:49.850> supposed<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.060> make<00:02:50.270> some

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
left and then it's supposed to make some

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.010 
left and then it's supposed to make some
like<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.320> zig<00:02:51.470> zag<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.860> goes<00:02:51.980> like<00:02:52.100> this

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
like the zig zag it goes like this

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.960 
like the zig zag it goes like this
and<00:02:54.020> if<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.920> lose<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.400> much<00:02:55.550> spin<00:02:55.790> it's

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
and if I lose it so much spin it's

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.270 
and if I lose it so much spin it's
stupid<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.750> doesn't<00:02:56.780> work<00:02:57.110> well<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.800> yeah<00:02:57.950> sure
