00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
website on facebook then we can create a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.899 
website on facebook then we can create a
directory<00:02:05.659> within<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.310> let's<00:02:08.519> say<00:02:08.759> we

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
directory within that so let's say we

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:15.050 
directory within that so let's say we
wanted<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> call<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.939> frame<00:02:12.080> yeah<00:02:14.060> that's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
wanted to call it I frame yeah that's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.059 
wanted to call it I frame yeah that's
our<00:02:15.330> directory<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.319> we<00:02:16.680> could<00:02:16.829> create

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
our directory and then we could create

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.559 
our directory and then we could create
our<00:02:18.739> username<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.999> our

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
our username and our

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.959 
our username and our
password<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.560> everything<00:02:23.549> else<00:02:23.730> down<00:02:23.909> here

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:23.969 
password and everything else down here

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.640 
password and everything else down here
that<00:02:24.329> we<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.810> want<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.079> put<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.290> there<00:02:25.499> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
that we would want to put on there and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.539 
that we would want to put on there and
then<00:02:25.859> install<00:02:26.609> WordPress<00:02:27.480> okay<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:29.249> that's<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
then install WordPress okay so that's a

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.330 
then install WordPress okay so that's a
separate<00:02:30.120> installation<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.200> WordPress<00:02:31.530> and

separate installation of WordPress and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.910 
separate installation of WordPress and
basically<00:02:33.209> what<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.599> doing<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.680> now

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
