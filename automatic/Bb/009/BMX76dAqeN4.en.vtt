00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
 6 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.969
 besides this it is still must now my name is always paid 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.259
 we have this rpg involved an internet test because that the building stood it 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:16.029
 brand new 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.159
 Innovative 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.039
 i may michielsen and groundbreaking screen because the normal 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.900
 LCD screens are built 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.960
 from the colors red green and blue yet is the fourth club 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.390
 added to that that ensures 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.099
 that the colors that are just one of the world around us 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 can of course be displayed 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.270
 and furthermore, the screen is able to let your light go through 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.510
 when extinguishing the energy consumption and better brightness 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.750
 and how to receive the contras 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.090
 of the images 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.010
 as with many modern LCD TVs 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.420
 the rear a little device is taken care of by this game in this 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.450
 in this case 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.530
 are mounted along the edges and off the screen 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.970
 we call that the cyclist 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.440
 and the train's small drawback is that if you are neatly assembled here 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.530
 effective 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 the second half following disk that is needed 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 the former employee at the school where fusing 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.490
 appearances may be deceptive in Chad has made optimum use of this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.220
 because of the connections down and there they did this to admit customers 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.200
 leave and any 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.550
 not at the neighbors depth of the device 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.180
 need to be added so that, for example, with tire assembly 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.490
 nice arrangement against the wall 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.520
 can be achieved 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.179
 the advantage of that and lestienne appear in the ten theootje moreover 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.240
 that facilitates 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.130
 said years to even turn it off and BTZ 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.010
 these are widely used 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.770
 with dark images they are automatically dimmed 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.730
 both buildings that are in the picture in the dark can also take the lessons there 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.180
 neighborhood 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.610
 some are pinned and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.390
 coming back to 3d which is very important is that the rest two hundred times per 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 be switched off like a second 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.749
 this time 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.510
 on the basis of these glasses, one of which the device is included 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:13.370
 why that is so 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.559
 interesting is that 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:18.609
 turn off and turn on letters at the time the image 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.079
 switches 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.519
 in the case of December 3, perhaps it is still partly too high or something 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.090
 that the images for left and right are broadcast in succession 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.439
 and every time as an example 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.340
 for the right 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.209
 comes in 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.930
 the left eye is shielded by these glasses 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 the image appears to read more than ever 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.039
 shielded the right eye but up 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.290
 transition 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 between two of those images are rock hard 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.299
 that the left eye can no longer be switched off 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.709
 while the image for ajax is just visible at that time 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.409
 We call this a crossover which means that mild for ex wants to be emphatically added 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.549
 links and images for links still trickle in at nec are through the now 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.019
 for the worries that during such an image change the ldd voted for ensuring that 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.670
 the image here is lengthened that the two are busy 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.489
 be dimmed for a moment at which the image is signed 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.329
 an i see cross over is also much less stronger yet we have no more there 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.989
 to track this TV 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.709
 but with these 9 25 movies including my comment states 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.139
 many high-quality materials 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.959
 use by an experience that are not allowed and very hey 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 well there was a very nice finish 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.639
 excellent signals that we often see entrance is very difficult of which is one 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.929
 whole meets place used you will ensures that especially when the unit is off 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:43.679
 the very nice design is what I am every time one 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:44.439
 step back 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.999
 when the thieves had had the incident pay attention to move 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.009
 us points 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.929
 of them vases plate 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:56.479
 the two teams that day it became clear that the charter this and 25 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.839
 for such that I find a bit by bit obligation on the market 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.399
 has brought 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:06.289
 not only because of their added no and and many points but also because of the 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.089
 application 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:08.139
 vangheluwe 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.499
 gets a faster and more and video processor that matters among other things 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.939
 is capable of this kind 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.209
 the very difficult one 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.590
 movements smoothly and yet sharply 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.930
 to bring 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.380
 for a comprehensive test of these rates that is also able to 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.689
 to show images 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:27.580
 I refer you from the internet to the November issue 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 from 3 percent November 2010 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.059
 9 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.720
