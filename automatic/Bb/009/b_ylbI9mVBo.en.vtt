right<00:04:38.150> now<00:04:38.230> it's<00:04:39.230> pretty<00:04:39.470> awesome<00:04:39.650> it's

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
right now it's pretty awesome it's

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.370 
right now it's pretty awesome it's
completely<00:04:40.880> pitch<00:04:41.090> black<00:04:41.120> up<00:04:41.510> here<00:04:41.720> we<00:04:42.290> are
