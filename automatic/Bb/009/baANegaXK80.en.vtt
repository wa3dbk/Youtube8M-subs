00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
don't really know what else there is so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
don't really know what else there is so
that's<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.270> equipment<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:15.900> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that's that the equipment that I use is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
that's that the equipment that I use is
not<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> best<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> most

a<00:02:48.389> double<00:02:48.720> mode<00:02:48.900> gameplay<00:02:49.260> on<00:02:50.100> my<00:02:50.489> channel<00:02:50.819> of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a double mode gameplay on my channel of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.629 
a double mode gameplay on my channel of
my<00:02:51.000> first<00:02:51.269> video<00:02:51.510> ah<00:02:52.160> some<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> might<00:02:53.459> know

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
my first video ah some of you might know

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.699 
my first video ah some of you might know
that<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.329> my<00:02:54.510> first<00:02:54.660> video<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that this is not my first video but the

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.559 
that this is not my first video but the
reason<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.340> me<00:02:56.609> saying<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.269> and

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
reason for me saying that it is and

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.050 
reason for me saying that it is and
deleting<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> old<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.889> because<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.370> bit<00:02:59.940> of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
deleting the old one is because a bit of

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
deleting the old one is because a bit of
a<00:03:00.269> perfectionist<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.739> didn't<00:03:01.950> like

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a perfectionist and I really didn't like

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.339 
a perfectionist and I really didn't like
the<00:03:02.220> old<00:03:02.340> one<00:03:02.519> which<00:03:03.510> was<00:03:03.690> also<00:03:03.870> an<00:03:04.049> effect

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
the old one which was also an effect

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.849 
the old one which was also an effect

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
audio was pretty bad so I thought you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.009

going<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.000> delete<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.540> use<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.109> as<00:03:25.290> my

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
going to delete that and use this as my

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.710 
going to delete that and use this as my
first<00:03:25.590> tis<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.609> pretty<00:03:26.790> cool<00:03:27.000> triple<00:03:27.389> kill<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
first tis a pretty cool triple kill that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.830
