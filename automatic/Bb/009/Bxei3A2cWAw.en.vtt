hi<00:00:06.319> this<00:00:06.379> is<00:00:06.620> Ryan<00:00:06.890> Phillips<00:00:07.160> for<00:00:07.370> DP<00:00:07.700> review

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
hi this is Ryan Phillips for DP review

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.190 
hi this is Ryan Phillips for DP review
today<00:00:08.240> we're<00:00:08.420> going<00:00:08.599> to<00:00:08.719> be<00:00:08.840> talking<00:00:09.049> about

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.379 
today we're going to be talking about
mechanical<00:00:09.860> stabilization<00:00:10.610> both<00:00:10.820> in<00:00:11.059> lens

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
mechanical stabilization both in lens

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.259 
mechanical stabilization both in lens
and<00:00:11.690> in<00:00:12.110> sensor<00:00:12.680> we're<00:00:13.429> here<00:00:13.670> in<00:00:13.820> Los<00:00:13.969> Angeles

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
and in sensor we're here in Los Angeles

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.089 
and in sensor we're here in Los Angeles
at<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.570> fig<00:00:14.839> house<00:00:15.049> it's<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.349> great<00:00:15.620> new<00:00:15.799> event

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
at the fig house it's a great new event

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.950 
at the fig house it's a great new event
space<00:00:16.400> it's<00:00:16.669> also<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.090> home<00:00:17.270> of<00:00:17.330> room<00:00:17.630> 40

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
space it's also the home of room 40

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.540 
space it's also the home of room 40
catering<00:00:18.470> we're<00:00:18.980> going<00:00:19.130> to<00:00:19.189> go<00:00:19.250> into<00:00:19.430> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
catering we're going to go into the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.190 
catering we're going to go into the
kitchen<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:19.939> some<00:00:20.390> really<00:00:20.630> low<00:00:20.750> light<00:00:20.989> and

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
kitchen and some really low light and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.170 
kitchen and some really low light and
test<00:00:21.619> out<00:00:21.800> these<00:00:21.950> cameras<00:00:22.399> and<00:00:22.579> see<00:00:22.820> how<00:00:22.970> well

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
test out these cameras and see how well

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.760 
test out these cameras and see how well
the<00:00:23.300> image<00:00:23.480> stabilization<00:00:23.779> works<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:24.529> both

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
the image stabilization works in both

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.510 
the image stabilization works in both
the<00:00:24.919> camera<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:25.430> in<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:25.880> lens

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.090 

you

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.290 

mechanical<00:00:40.100> image<00:00:40.340> stabilization<00:00:40.699> comes<00:00:41.180> in

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
mechanical image stabilization comes in

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.030 
mechanical image stabilization comes in
two<00:00:41.420> varieties<00:00:41.629> either<00:00:42.320> by<00:00:42.440> moving<00:00:42.590> a<00:00:42.800> lens

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
two varieties either by moving a lens

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.430 
two varieties either by moving a lens
element<00:00:43.610> or<00:00:43.760> moving<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.329> camera<00:00:44.570> sensor<00:00:45.199> to

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
element or moving the camera sensor to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.750 
element or moving the camera sensor to
compensate<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> movement<00:00:46.460> of<00:00:46.699> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
compensate for the movement of the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.130 
compensate for the movement of the
photographer<00:00:47.300> as<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.570> shutter<00:00:47.809> button<00:00:47.899> is

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
photographer as the shutter button is

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.000 
photographer as the shutter button is
pressed

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
pressed

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
pressed
all<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> kitchen

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
all right so now we're in the kitchen

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.340 
all right so now we're in the kitchen
sort<00:00:52.380> of<00:00:52.559> somebody<00:00:53.120> had<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.480> great<00:00:54.960> idea<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sort of somebody had the great idea to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
sort of somebody had the great idea to
put<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> freezer<00:00:56.190> let<00:00:56.460> me<00:00:56.610> freeze<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
put me in a freezer let me freeze and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.210 
put me in a freezer let me freeze and
then<00:00:57.450> really<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.530> how<00:00:58.680> well<00:00:58.860> image

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
then really see how well image

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.150 
then really see how well image
stabilization<00:00:59.520> works<00:01:00.150> so<00:01:00.920> we're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.040> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
stabilization works so we're going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
stabilization works so we're going to
test<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.300> stuff<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
test this out just stuff in here and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
test this out just stuff in here and
then<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.190> trying<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> out<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.940> as<00:01:06.150> quickly

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
then I'm trying it out here as quickly

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:22.639 
then I'm trying it out here as quickly
as<00:01:06.570> possible<00:01:20.540> image<00:01:21.540> stabilization<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.380> not

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
as possible image stabilization will not

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.560 
as possible image stabilization will not
help<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> freeze<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> moving<00:01:23.580> subject<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
help you freeze a moving subject that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.330 
help you freeze a moving subject that
will<00:01:24.720> require<00:01:25.050> enough<00:01:25.500> light<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> use<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> fast

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
will require enough light to use a fast

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.790 
will require enough light to use a fast
shutter<00:01:26.580> speed<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.690> will<00:01:27.930> however<00:01:28.289> let<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
shutter speed it will however let you

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.290 
shutter speed it will however let you
shoot<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.190> slower<00:01:29.460> speeds<00:01:29.610> than<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.149> might

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
shoot at slower speeds than you might

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.600 
shoot at slower speeds than you might
normally<00:01:30.330> get<00:01:30.840> away<00:01:31.050> with<00:01:31.259> often<00:01:31.590> letting<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
normally get away with often letting you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
normally get away with often letting you
leave<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> tripod<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.390> home<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:34.560> especially

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
leave the tripod at home it's especially

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.320 
leave the tripod at home it's especially
helpful<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.550> shooting<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.910> longer<00:01:36.300> range
