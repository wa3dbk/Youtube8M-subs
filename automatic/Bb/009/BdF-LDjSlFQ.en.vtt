00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.580
 hello guys welcome to the channel ms art 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.350
 today we are going to talk about how to hang a 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.410
 picture of the living that is also 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.660
 valid for other pictures the elements 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.859
 or the tools that you need are 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.869
 the following a drill a drill 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.119
 of 5 millimeters a pencil some glasses for 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.390
 protect us when drilling in the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.630
 wall 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.640
 to hungry some tongs to cut the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:44.379
 wire 1 meter 2 in bright 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.379
 two studs and two screws in l 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.720
 the first step that we are going to do in the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.660
 back panel of this box 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.660
 this box measures 150 x 70 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.289
 we turn the picture 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.030
 and we get to work 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.619
 we mark it at 10 centimeters in the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.619
 profile of the frame 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.299
 to 10 centimeters we make a mark 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 we drill a little bit can be with this 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.680
 popcorn with a scissor with any 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 thing that you can make a hole 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.890
 once the hole is made we put the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.630
 embry there and we put it in the side 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.630
 It's important to remember 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.220
 what has to be placed in the profile 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 in the back but on the edge 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 we put it well and introduce well 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.160
 so that it is already hard and fixed 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.410
 once done this side we will do the other 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.410
 side 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 we take the wire we extend it in the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.820
 back and we cut 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 approximately 160 centimeters 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.740
 we introduce the wire into the washer 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.020
 and we make some knots 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.020
 so that it is well secured 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.500
 we look a little bit of the wire like 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.660
 You see, it has to be finite so that it 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.660
 can handle with ease 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.599
 That would be enough 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.329
 remember that the wire should not be left 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.000
 never tense the wire is just one 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.189
 security measure as you see is 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.530
 perfectly it's just in case 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.930
 you fall box on the wall always 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.880
 will hold on the wire but it should 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.550
 be loose light not tense 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.350
 we have to move on to the next step 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.230
 we have to do it on the wall in the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.160
 wall you have to mark two points that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.410
 there may be a distance 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.780
 approximately among them 60 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.780
 centimeters like here we have a ledge 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.650
 it serves as the shelf if there were not 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.140
 shelf 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.930
 let's go from the ground to the point 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.780
 where do we really want the part 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.630
 top of the box we put the subway 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.050
 so and we proceed to mark the point that 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.170
 we want in this case is here and 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.540
 approximately 60 centimeters 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.030
 we return to mark another point to it 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.030
 distance that are 100 in this case 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.780
 we have already made the hole we proceed to 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.780
 place the cue in the hole 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:23.270
 we introduce the screw in the form of l 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:28.690
 on the wall where the hole is 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.690
 we give a few laps to fix it well 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.629
 once the 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.520
 hooks on the two points of the wall 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:42.580
 we proceed to place the box for 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.819
 hang the picture the hook has 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.270
 that support at this point you take the 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:52.300
 alcayata with the wire and the alcayata 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.249
 hold the box by the profile part 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.819
 behind 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:00.179
 we place the wire on top of the 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.179
 alcayata 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.000
 and we put the box 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:20.699
 at the other point we do the same 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:23.499
 we put the wire and then the box 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.929
 well guys you have already seen that it is 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.539
 the hanging picture remind you the wire 

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:30.879
 it's just a security measure where 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.219
 really the picture is subject is in the 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:35.259
 alcayatas so that you can never be 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:39.069
 spoil I hope you liked it 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.229

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:42.879
 any information any inquiry 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.129
