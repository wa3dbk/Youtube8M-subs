not<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.050> any<00:01:43.200> switches<00:01:45.410> so<00:01:46.410> we

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
not going to make any switches so we

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.109 
not going to make any switches so we
have<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> nice<00:01:46.770> clean<00:01:47.100> Fender<00:01:47.550> acetone<00:01:47.970> and

that's<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> model<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.810> modeled<00:01:49.560> after

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that's what the model is modeled after

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.320 
that's what the model is modeled after
you're<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:50.910> the<00:01:51.030> normal

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
controls so what I'm going to do here is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.150 
controls so what I'm going to do here is
I'm<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> shift<00:02:10.500> things<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> like

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
I'm going to shift things the way I like

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
I'm going to shift things the way I like
them

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
them

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670 
them
make<00:02:12.030> sure<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.210> have<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.570> bass<00:02:12.780> at<00:02:13.020> 5<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.590> is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
make sure I have the bass at 5 this is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.810 
make sure I have the bass at 5 this is
what<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:13.860> would<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.310> walked<00:02:14.520> up<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.700> any

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
what I would do if I walked up to any

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.030 
what I would do if I walked up to any
real-world<00:02:15.150> amp<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.350> that's<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
real-world amp and that's one of the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.309 
real-world amp and that's one of the
coolest<00:02:17.340> points<00:02:17.670> about<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.690> application

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
coolest points about the the application

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.559 
coolest points about the the application
is<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> fact<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:20.970> closer<00:02:21.240> related

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
is the fact that it's so closer related

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.000 
is the fact that it's so closer related
to<00:02:21.750> what<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.200> we're<00:02:22.319> used<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.620> looking

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to what it is that we're used to looking

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.070 
to what it is that we're used to looking
at<00:02:23.130> so<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.960> know<00:02:25.050> just

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
at so we can really you know just

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.840 
at so we can really you know just
utilize<00:02:25.710> all<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> knowledge<00:02:26.130> we<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
utilize all the knowledge we have on the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.570 
utilize all the knowledge we have on the
real<00:02:27.000> world<00:02:27.210> stuff<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.690> apply<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:27.990> here

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
real world stuff and just apply it here

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
real world stuff and just apply it here
but<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.210> differences<00:02:30.569> we<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.900> use<00:02:31.020> in

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
but just the differences we just use in

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.750 
but just the differences we just use in
one<00:02:31.290> finger<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.800> we<00:02:32.490> come<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:32.700> here

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
one finger so we come over here

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.130 
one finger so we come over here
just<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.879> presents<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:37.110> a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
just that presents not just to get a

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.949 
just that presents not just to get a
little<00:02:37.260> bit<00:02:37.439> more<00:02:37.590> high<00:02:37.739> as<00:02:37.799> happening<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
little bit more high as happening the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.780 
little bit more high as happening the
knob<00:02:40.200> adjusting<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.739> matter<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.040> touching

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
knob adjusting is a matter of touching

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.280 
knob adjusting is a matter of touching
the<00:02:41.849> knob<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.659> up<00:02:42.780> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.049> want<00:02:43.230> to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the knob going up if you want to

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
the knob going up if you want to
increase<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.829> coming<00:02:44.310> down<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> want<00:02:44.909> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
increase and coming down if you want to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
increase and coming down if you want to
decrease<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.659> want<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.959> decrease<00:02:46.170> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
decrease and I want to decrease that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.330 
decrease and I want to decrease that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
this one in this case we have tremolo so

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.569 
this one in this case we have tremolo so
it's<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.739> matter<00:03:07.889> of<00:03:08.010> taking<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.370> knobs

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
it's a matter of taking the knobs

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.009 
it's a matter of taking the knobs
raising<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.599> knobs

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
raising the knobs

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.140 
raising the knobs
let's<00:03:10.799> get<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.099> depth<00:03:11.370> full<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:11.790> we<00:03:11.879> get<00:03:12.000> that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
let's get that depth full so we get that

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.860 
let's get that depth full so we get that
helicopter<00:03:12.299> effect<00:03:16.790> sounds<00:03:17.790> great<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.659> we

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
helicopter effect sounds great so we

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.390 
helicopter effect sounds great so we
have<00:03:18.989> here<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.349> far<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.980> clean<00:03:20.189> amp

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have here so far it's just a clean amp

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.319 
have here so far it's just a clean amp
if<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.639> want<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.849> change<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.269> mic<00:03:23.150> let's<00:03:24.150> back

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
if I want to change the mic let's back

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.179 
if I want to change the mic let's back
off<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.720> tremolo<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:25.920> change<00:03:26.099> the

off on that tremolo I want to change the

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.319 
off on that tremolo I want to change the
mic<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> matter<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:26.970> tapping<00:03:27.180> the

on flanger back off on the feedback
which<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.680> actually<00:04:45.099> a<00:04:45.130> delay<00:04:45.400> setting<00:04:46.770> keep

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
which is actually a delay setting keep

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.129 
which is actually a delay setting keep
the<00:04:47.889> Ray<00:04:48.039> nice<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.490> slow<00:04:48.669> pump<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.449> that<00:04:49.479> depth

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
the Ray nice and slow pump up that depth

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.450 
the Ray nice and slow pump up that depth
and<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:52.720> we<00:04:52.840> can<00:04:52.960> hear<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.260> more<00:04:53.740> let's<00:04:54.190> back

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
and so we can hear it more let's back

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.550 
and so we can hear it more let's back
off<00:04:54.639> on<00:04:54.880> thee

so<00:05:04.560> we're<00:05:04.710> doing<00:05:04.920> here<00:05:05.100> is<00:05:05.190> compounding

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
so we're doing here is compounding

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.090 
so we're doing here is compounding
time-based<00:05:06.270> effects<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.870> when<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.890> signal

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
time-based effects and when the signal

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.760 
time-based effects and when the signal
up<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:09.210> to<00:05:10.020> complete<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.410> trio<00:05:10.650> of

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
up and to complete the trio of

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.200 
up and to complete the trio of
time-based<00:05:11.160> effects<00:05:11.430> let's<00:05:11.610> go<00:05:11.700> for<00:05:11.910> chorus

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
time-based effects let's go for chorus

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.100 
time-based effects let's go for chorus
its<00:05:12.390> turn<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.750> on

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
its turn it on

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.020 
its turn it on
I<00:05:13.140> love<00:05:13.680> cranking<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.280> depth<00:05:14.460> on<00:05:14.640> a<00:05:14.670> chorus

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
I love cranking the depth on a chorus

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.470 
I love cranking the depth on a chorus
keep<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> level<00:05:15.630> real<00:05:15.780> high<00:05:17.300> let's<00:05:18.300> lower

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
keep the level real high let's lower

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.560 
keep the level real high let's lower
that<00:05:18.660> rate<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.230> we<00:05:19.350> don't<00:05:19.500> get<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:20.570> changhie

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
that rate so we don't get that changhie

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.260 
that rate so we don't get that changhie
thing<00:05:22.370> there<00:05:23.370> we<00:05:23.580> go<00:05:23.760> nice<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:26.120> can't<00:05:27.120> have<00:05:27.210> a

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
thing there we go nice and can't have a

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.910 
thing there we go nice and can't have a
time-based<00:05:27.510> array<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.140> effects<00:05:28.440> without<00:05:28.650> the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
ultimate time-based effect from which

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.610 
ultimate time-based effect from which
all<00:05:30.480> these<00:05:30.600> effects<00:05:30.930> are<00:05:31.020> made<00:05:31.170> from<00:05:31.410> oh

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
all these effects are made from oh

all these effects are made from oh
except<00:05:32.340> for<00:05:32.370> phasing<00:05:32.670> but<00:05:33.830> turn<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.920> delay<00:05:35.190> on

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
except for phasing but turn the delay on

make<00:05:36.210> sure<00:05:36.390> your<00:05:36.540> level<00:05:37.460> is<00:05:38.460> it<00:05:38.610> a<00:05:38.670> place<00:05:38.880> where

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
make sure your level is it a place where

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.310 
make sure your level is it a place where
you<00:05:39.090> going<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.390> it<00:05:39.540> make<00:05:39.930> sure<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.140> put

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
you going to like it make sure you put

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.690 
you going to like it make sure you put
your<00:05:40.470> delay<00:05:40.710> up<00:05:40.950> to<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.160> point<00:05:41.460> where<00:05:41.610> you're

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
your delay up to a point where you're

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.560 
your delay up to a point where you're
going<00:05:41.850> to<00:05:41.910> feel<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:44.280> repeats<00:05:44.760> so<00:05:45.120> if<00:05:45.390> you

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
going to feel the the repeats so if you

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.600 
going to feel the the repeats so if you
start<00:05:45.840> off<00:05:45.990> with<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.260> effect<00:05:46.590> here<00:05:47.010> you<00:05:47.460> might

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
start off with the effect here you might

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.860 
start off with the effect here you might
get<00:05:47.760> thrown<00:05:47.970> off<00:05:48.090> if<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.300> look<00:05:48.420> down<00:05:48.570> here<00:05:48.630> at

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
get thrown off if you look down here at

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.390 
get thrown off if you look down here at
the<00:05:48.960> setting<00:05:49.230> that's<00:05:49.350> 95<00:05:49.770> milliseconds

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
the setting that's 95 milliseconds

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.920 
the setting that's 95 milliseconds
that's<00:05:50.520> pretty<00:05:50.700> fast<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:51.570> you're<00:05:51.690> not<00:05:51.780> going

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
that's pretty fast so you're not going

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.510 
that's pretty fast so you're not going
to<00:05:51.990> hear<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.410> actual<00:05:52.530> repeats<00:05:53.070> let's<00:05:53.280> go<00:05:53.400> up

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
to hear the actual repeats let's go up

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.290 
to hear the actual repeats let's go up
to<00:05:53.640> here<00:05:53.820> up<00:05:53.970> to<00:05:54.480> here<00:05:54.510> say<00:05:55.760> 500<00:05:56.760> range<00:05:56.940> and<00:05:57.240> we

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
to here up to here say 500 range and we

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.270 
to here up to here say 500 range and we
got<00:05:57.420> 560<00:05:58.110> milliseconds<00:05:58.680> back<00:05:58.860> off<00:05:59.040> on<00:05:59.070> the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
got 560 milliseconds back off on the

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.860 
got 560 milliseconds back off on the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
feedback and there you go so we've

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.960 
feedback and there you go so we've

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
four effects that go front end in if you

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.210 
four effects that go front end in if you
want<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:12.750> save<00:06:12.960> that<00:06:13.200> preset<00:06:13.620> remember<00:06:14.070> it's

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
want to save that preset remember it's

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.530 
want to save that preset remember it's

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
down till eternity yellow or you'll go

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.300 
down till eternity yellow or you'll go
through<00:06:21.530> two-step<00:06:22.530> process<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:23.070> we'll<00:06:23.190> go

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
through two-step process that we'll go

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.970 
through two-step process that we'll go
over<00:06:23.400> when<00:06:24.180> we<00:06:24.270> create<00:06:24.540> a<00:06:24.570> dirtier<00:06:25.080> tone<00:06:25.470> where

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
over when we create a dirtier tone where

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.170 
over when we create a dirtier tone where
you'll<00:06:26.130> be<00:06:26.220> able<00:06:26.250> to<00:06:26.430> save<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.730> that<00:06:26.880> way<00:06:27.000> but

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
you'll be able to save it that way but

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.490 
you'll be able to save it that way but
for<00:06:27.300> now<00:06:27.420> let's<00:06:27.660> just<00:06:27.720> hold<00:06:27.990> down<00:06:28.110> number

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
for now let's just hold down number

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.810 
for now let's just hold down number
eight<00:06:28.760> and<00:06:30.080> there<00:06:31.080> you<00:06:31.170> have<00:06:31.320> it<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:32.490> you're

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
eight and there you have it and you're

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.460 
eight and there you have it and you're
good<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:32.970> go

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470
