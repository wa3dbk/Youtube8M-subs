 the struggles have they depend on the piece 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.790

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 20 minutes every every kilo of 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.360

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.790
 we take it out of the oven so we went 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.319
 ten good minutes 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.700
