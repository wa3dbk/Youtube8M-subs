00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.340 
time to show you guys the progress on
the<00:00:04.859> supercharger<00:00:05.609> install<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.569> what<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the supercharger install and what the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.980 
the supercharger install and what the
kit<00:00:07.710> kind<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.040> looks<00:00:08.220> like<00:00:08.660> basically<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
kit kind of looks like basically this is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.129 
kit kind of looks like basically this is
a<00:00:10.019> bracket<00:00:10.320> where<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> wrote<00:00:11.190> rates<00:00:11.460> mounts

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
a bracket where the wrote rates mounts

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.760 
a bracket where the wrote rates mounts
this<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.559> tensioner<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> doesn't<00:00:14.820> fit

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
this is the tensioner that doesn't fit

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.290 
this is the tensioner that doesn't fit
you<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.890> get<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> line<00:00:17.580> up<00:00:17.789> actually<00:00:18.210> if

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
you can get it to line up actually if

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.640 
you can get it to line up actually if
you<00:00:18.390> stick<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.109> about<00:00:19.170> 1/2<00:00:19.470> an

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
you stick it in there it's about 1/2 an

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.460 
you stick it in there it's about 1/2 an
inch<00:00:19.740> too<00:00:20.010> thin<00:00:20.720> we're<00:00:21.720> gonna<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> take

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
inch too thin we're gonna have to take

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.490 
inch too thin we're gonna have to take
out<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.980> bar<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.580> don't<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.689> doubt<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
out this bar I don't know if I doubt the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
out this bar I don't know if I doubt the
kit<00:00:25.740> will<00:00:25.920> fit<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> reason<00:00:27.630> being<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.990> bar

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
kit will fit the reason being this bar

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
kit will fit the reason being this bar
is<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:29.630> beefy<00:00:30.769> most<00:00:31.769> bars<00:00:32.099> don't<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
is really beefy most bars don't go here

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.560 
is really beefy most bars don't go here
and<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.190> air<00:00:35.670> sensor<00:00:36.180> where<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and with this air sensor where it is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
and with this air sensor where it is
normally<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.200> would<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.370> we<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.550> have

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
normally there would be we would have

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.389 
normally there would be we would have
the<00:00:39.210> supercharger<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.040> 90

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the supercharger and then like one 90

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.540 
the supercharger and then like one 90
degree<00:00:41.670> pipe<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.559> then<00:00:43.559> over<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> one

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
degree pipe and then over here and one

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670 
degree pipe and then over here and one
more<00:00:44.730> 90<00:00:45.030> degree<00:00:45.300> pipe<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.840> there's<00:00:46.050> probably

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
more 90 degree pipe so there's probably

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.540 
more 90 degree pipe so there's probably
no<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.100> unless<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:49.020> fit<00:00:49.550> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
no way unless we cut that to fit the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.200 
no way unless we cut that to fit the
pipes<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:52.440> bar<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.949> place<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> I'm

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pipes with the bar in place so I'm

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
pipes with the bar in place so I'm
probably<00:00:54.390> gonna<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.870> selling<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.350> pretty

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
probably gonna be selling this pretty

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.849 
probably gonna be selling this pretty
cool<00:00:56.550> design<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.090> got<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.859> Phillips

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cool design you got your two Phillips

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.380 
cool design you got your two Phillips
screws<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> backing<00:00:59.969> plate<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
screws and there's a backing plate on

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.310 
screws and there's a backing plate on
the<00:01:00.539> back<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.940> totally<00:01:03.539> necessary<00:01:03.719> in

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the back it's not totally necessary in

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.240 
the back it's not totally necessary in
the<00:01:04.470> Miata

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the Miata

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570 
the Miata
that<00:01:05.659> it's<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.930> nice<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.830> looks<00:01:08.010> pretty

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that it's kind of nice it looks pretty

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
that it's kind of nice it looks pretty
cool<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.750> only<00:01:09.930> decent<00:01:10.320> looking<00:01:10.799> thing

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
cool that's my only decent looking thing

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.480 
cool that's my only decent looking thing
I<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.549> hood<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> plumbing

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I know this hood this is the plumbing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170 
I know this hood this is the plumbing
for<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> oil<00:01:15.869> cooler<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.340> hooked<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
for the oil cooler it's not hooked up I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
for the oil cooler it's not hooked up I
think<00:01:18.950> this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.450> air<00:01:21.450> conditioner<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
think this is the air conditioner this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
think this is the air conditioner this
is<00:01:23.040> where<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.340> snipped<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> was

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
is where we snipped it because it was

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.410 
is where we snipped it because it was
totally<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.850> oil<00:01:26.850> cooler

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
totally in the way of this oil cooler

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.340 
totally in the way of this oil cooler
and<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.720> snipped<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> air

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and so this was snipped the air

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
and so this was snipped the air
conditioning<00:01:31.829> wasn't<00:01:32.009> working<00:01:32.520> anyways<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
conditioning wasn't working anyways it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.160 
conditioning wasn't working anyways it
was<00:01:33.689> leaking<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.320> usually<00:01:35.100> when<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.400> cut<00:01:36.170> air

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
was leaking and usually when you cut air

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.940 
was leaking and usually when you cut air
conditioning<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> gases

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
conditioning like that you see the gases

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.429 
conditioning like that you see the gases
escape<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.880> nothing<00:01:42.600> happened<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> time

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
escape but nothing happened this time

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.429 
escape but nothing happened this time
around<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.210> old<00:01:45.390> cooler<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.930> clamps

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
around and the old cooler just clamps

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.310 
around and the old cooler just clamps
with<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.610> brackets<00:01:47.820> over<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> edge

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
with these little brackets over the edge

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
with these little brackets over the edge
