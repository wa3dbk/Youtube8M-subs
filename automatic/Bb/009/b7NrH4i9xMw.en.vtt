00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.309 

so<00:02:51.430> let's<00:02:51.610> try<00:02:51.819> booting<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.569> device<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
so let's try booting on this device and

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:10.160 
so let's try booting on this device and
let's<00:02:53.770> see<00:02:53.980> what<00:02:54.099> happens<00:02:54.160> here

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.620 

so<00:03:11.170> upon<00:03:11.500> booting<00:03:12.190> device<00:03:12.640> apple<00:03:13.390> always

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
so upon booting device apple always

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.320 
so upon booting device apple always
sends<00:03:14.410> their<00:03:14.650> device<00:03:14.980> out<00:03:15.220> or<00:03:15.610> sell<00:03:16.090> their

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
sends their device out or sell their

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.470 
sends their device out or sell their
device<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.990> you<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.760> precharge<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.240> don't

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
device to you a precharge so you don't

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.450
