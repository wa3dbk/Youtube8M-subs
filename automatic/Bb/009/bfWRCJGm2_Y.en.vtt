and it's six centuries so in each

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.400 
and it's six centuries so in each

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the humans have populated a little too

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.029 
the humans have populated a little too
much<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.660> growing<00:00:44.899> up<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.110> his<00:00:45.260> territory<00:00:45.500> so

much of growing up in his territory so

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.139 
much of growing up in his territory so
then<00:00:46.160> you're<00:00:46.309> going<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.460> go<00:00:46.519> through<00:00:46.789> and<00:00:46.969> rape

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
then you're going to go through and rape

then you're going to go through and rape
and<00:00:47.300> pillage<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.719> plunder<00:00:48.079> still<00:00:48.829> your

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
and pillage and plunder still your

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.919 
and pillage and plunder still your
plunder<00:00:49.219> go<00:00:49.489> back<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.850> sleep<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.359> then

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
plunder go back to sleep and then

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.239 
plunder go back to sleep and then
another<00:00:51.170> century<00:00:51.679> is<00:00:51.769> going<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:51.980> go<00:00:52.039> by<00:00:52.070> and

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
another century is going to go by and

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.979 
another century is going to go by and
the<00:00:52.489> humans<00:00:52.820> will<00:00:52.969> try<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.179> scrape<00:00:53.510> back<00:00:53.719> out

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the humans will try to scrape back out

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.259 
the humans will try to scrape back out
of<00:00:54.019> where<00:00:54.589> you<00:00:54.710> kick<00:00:54.980> them<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.179> you

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
of where you kick them to and then you

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.360 
of where you kick them to and then you
get<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.420> come<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:56.660> do<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:56.960> again<00:00:57.019> okay<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
get to come and do it again okay so the

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.709 
get to come and do it again okay so the
way<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.609> works<00:00:58.670> is<00:00:59.179> that<00:01:00.399> each<00:01:01.399> turn<00:01:01.909> we're

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
way this works is that each turn we're

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.149 
way this works is that each turn we're
going<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.050> start<00:01:03.320> out<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.559> this<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:03.739> kind<00:01:03.949> of<00:01:04.040> a

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
going to start out and this is kind of a

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.280 
going to start out and this is kind of a
in<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:05.360> know<00:01:05.480> let's<00:01:05.690> say<00:01:05.840> we're<00:01:05.990> going<00:01:06.230> to

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
in you know let's say we're going to

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.960 
in you know let's say we're going to
start<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.650> third<00:01:06.680> turn<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.400> rotate<00:01:07.820> down

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
start the third turn you rotate down

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.360 
start the third turn you rotate down
here<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.450> third<00:01:08.659> turn<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.280> have

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
here to the third turn and then you have

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.010 
here to the third turn and then you have
multiple<00:01:10.550> mechanisms<00:01:10.970> going<00:01:11.630> on<00:01:11.720> here<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
multiple mechanisms going on here the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.000 
multiple mechanisms going on here the
first<00:01:12.229> thing<00:01:12.320> you're<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.680> to<00:01:12.740> do<00:01:12.860> is<00:01:12.950> you're

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
first thing you're going to do is you're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.399 
first thing you're going to do is you're
going<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.220> lay<00:01:13.340> these<00:01:13.460> cards<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.060> here<00:01:14.409> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
going to lay these cards up here and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.620 
going to lay these cards up here and
this<00:01:15.530> last<00:01:15.860> car<00:01:16.280> over<00:01:16.580> here<00:01:16.909> is<00:01:17.060> going<00:01:17.570> to

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
this last car over here is going to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.290 
this last car over here is going to
determine<00:01:17.840> where<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.560> one<00:01:18.800> points<00:01:19.340> so

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
determine where this one points so

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.850 
determine where this one points so
that's<00:01:20.570> germane<00:01:21.050> e<00:01:21.110> over<00:01:21.410> there<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:21.740> we're

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that's germane e over there so we're

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.920 
that's germane e over there so we're
going<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> point<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.370> down<00:01:22.610> here<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.450> then

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
going to point that down here and then

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.960 
going to point that down here and then
you're<00:01:24.050> going<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.230> populate<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:25.190> sheep<00:01:25.610> over

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
you're going to populate a sheep over

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.320 
you're going to populate a sheep over
here<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.450> gold<00:01:26.780> over<00:01:27.110> here<00:01:27.710> noble<00:01:28.610> over<00:01:28.850> here

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
here and gold over here noble over here

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.050 
here and gold over here noble over here
and<00:01:29.510> then<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.290> fields<00:01:30.980> yep<00:01:31.400> according<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
and then the fields yep according to the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.780 
and then the fields yep according to the
wheel<00:01:32.240> ok<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:32.990> then<00:01:33.650> based<00:01:34.070> upon<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.580> back

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
wheel ok and then based upon the back

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.400 
wheel ok and then based upon the back
side<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.180> these<00:01:35.510> cards<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.110> will<00:01:36.230> then

side of these cards you will then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.740 
side of these cards you will then
populate<00:01:36.820> so<00:01:37.820> I've<00:01:37.940> got<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.120> green<00:01:38.420> over<00:01:38.720> here

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
populate so I've got a green over here

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.510 
populate so I've got a green over here

populate<00:01:47.660> another<00:01:48.590> green<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.370> then<00:01:49.550> this<00:01:49.760> one

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
populate another green so then this one

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.600 
populate another green so then this one
automatically<00:01:50.780> turns<00:01:51.080> into<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.410> city<00:01:51.770> they

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
automatically turns into a city they

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.130 
automatically turns into a city they
really<00:01:52.880> grew<00:01:53.060> up<00:01:53.180> pretty<00:01:53.390> big<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.870> then<00:01:54.050> the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
really grew up pretty big and then the

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.900 
really grew up pretty big and then the
last<00:01:54.260> one<00:01:54.440> in<00:01:54.650> Scandia<00:01:55.190> they<00:01:55.340> also<00:01:55.490> would<00:01:55.760> get

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
last one in Scandia they also would get

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.180 
last one in Scandia they also would get
a<00:01:55.940> city

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
a city

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.410 
a city
in<00:01:57.820> these<00:01:58.000> cards<00:01:58.360> are<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.630> flip<00:01:58.840> over

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.740 
in these cards are going to flip over
and<00:02:00.720> then<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> dragons<00:02:01.770> thank<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.750> the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
start the into the action phase and the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.320 
start the into the action phase and the
way<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> action<00:02:49.590> phase<00:02:49.860> starts<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.000> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
way the action phase starts as that is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
way the action phase starts as that is
whoever<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.840> attack<00:02:52.140> phase<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.769> let's<00:02:52.950> see

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
whoever the attack phase is so let's see

face<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:55.950> he<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.280> start<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:57.480> he<00:02:57.510> has<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
face so he would start then he has a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.340 
face so he would start then he has a
number<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> cards<00:02:58.709> in<00:02:58.980> his<00:02:59.100> hands<00:02:59.580> here<00:03:00.350> and

dragon is located okay let's see what my
cards<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.269> over<00:03:15.510> here<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:16.950> we're

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
cards are so over here so because we're

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.910 
cards are so over here so because we're
placing<00:03:17.459> them<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:17.940> in<00:03:18.090> turn<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.170> sometimes<00:03:19.709> if

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
placing them in in turn so sometimes if

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.860 
placing them in in turn so sometimes if
you're<00:03:20.040> further<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.640> turn<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.450> might<00:03:21.660> not

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
you're further in the turn you might not

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.349 
you're further in the turn you might not
have<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.650> good<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.920> options<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> cards

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
have that good of options of the cards

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.539 
have that good of options of the cards
you<00:03:24.480> have<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.560> got<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.160> you
