here<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.699> multiplication<00:01:00.059> two

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
here you can also do multiplication two

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.889 
here you can also do multiplication two
and<00:01:01.199> division<00:01:02.100> using<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> slide<00:01:03.449> rule<00:01:03.660> so

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and division using the slide rule so

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
and division using the slide rule so
it's<00:01:04.019> pretty<00:01:04.140> comprehensive<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.510> just<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
it's pretty comprehensive and just to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.590 
it's pretty comprehensive and just to
demonstrate<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.689> use<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
demonstrate to you the use of the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
demonstrate to you the use of the
chronograph<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.040> press<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> button<00:01:14.250> right

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
chronograph I press the button right

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.410 
chronograph I press the button right
over<00:01:14.640> here

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
over here

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.399 
over here
and<00:01:15.920> there<00:01:16.920> goes<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.610> second<00:01:18.060> hand<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.689> right

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and there goes the second hand is right

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670 
and there goes the second hand is right
and<00:01:20.390> one<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> nicer<00:01:21.930> things<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.439> this

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and one of the nicer things about this

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760 
and one of the nicer things about this
watch<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.049> once<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.409> stop

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
watch is that as you can see once I stop

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
watch is that as you can see once I stop
it<00:01:25.979> here<00:01:26.840> stops<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> dime<00:01:28.200> we'll<00:01:28.619> give<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it here stops on a dime we'll give you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920 
it here stops on a dime we'll give you
the<00:01:29.009> milliseconds<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.299> displays<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the milliseconds it also displays the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
the milliseconds it also displays the
number<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.409> hours<00:01:31.770> number<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.159> minutes<00:01:32.490> here's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
number of hours number of minutes here's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.749 
number of hours number of minutes here's
the<00:01:33.600> milliseconds<00:01:34.170> right<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.610> go

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the milliseconds right there when you go

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.469 
the milliseconds right there when you go
to<00:01:35.820> reset<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> stopwatch<00:01:37.939> snaps<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.240> back

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to reset the stopwatch snaps right back

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
to reset the stopwatch snaps right back
to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> 12<00:01:40.470> o'clock<00:01:40.560> position<00:01:40.799> instantly

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to the 12 o'clock position instantly

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.080 
to the 12 o'clock position instantly
that's<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:43.430> helpful<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.759> you're<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:44.970> an

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
that's really helpful when you're in an

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's really helpful when you're in an
airplane<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.560> flying<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.070> holding

holding pattern and you're timing for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.780 
holding pattern and you're timing for
one<00:01:49.890> minute<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.409> once<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> hit<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
one minute and and once you hit the one

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.929 
one minute and and once you hit the one
minute<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.630> stop<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.710> want<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> reset<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
minute you stop it you want to reset and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.020 
minute you stop it you want to reset and
start<00:01:57.320> timing<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> next<00:01:58.920> minute<00:01:59.159> when
