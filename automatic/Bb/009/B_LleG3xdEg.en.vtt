00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.919
Hi, how are you? If you're afraid of heights, you better switch channel

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.659
Today I'm going to run and jump at full speed over buildings and skyscrappers

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.039
in Mirror's Edge

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.730
This is Mirror's Edge first level after the tutorial

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.509
Head tracking runs like every other game, however

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.240
sensitivity is too high

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.230
even though I've set it to minimum

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.590
the game character, Faith, 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.920
turns her head more than me, so I must move it

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.490
carefully

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.540
not very fast

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.370
or I can get dizzy easily

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.370
Let's start running and jumping! First big jump

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.880
This game is not for Oculus Rift newbies!

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.280
Vertigo feeling is brutal, just look at this jump

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.880
I can see my body, this is important to believe I'm in the game

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.880
I've got the feeling that my character is there

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.880
The 3D effect, altough you can't see it, is very strong

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.880
I can follow the birds with my head

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's go!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.710
This is a tough test for my balance!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.710
I'm moving my head without noticing it, it's so real...

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.640
I think this game has been heavily underrated, I enjoyed it a lot

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
Another jump

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Oh my God!

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.839
Let's get more action over here

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:13.239
I must move my head slowly

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.870
I must hang over there

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.499
and look back to get there... that's it

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.339
and now

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:26.299
over that passage

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.969
This is so well made, the 3D effect

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.739
makes you believe you are so high

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.979
Let's go

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:46.979
Flee time!

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.729
I'm looking for the rooftop

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.309
And here we go again

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.309
The height feeling is awesome

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.109
With the Oculus Rift it's a brand new game

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.509
But there is too much head bobing

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.319
On a monitor or TV it's fine, realistic

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.709
but on the Oculus Rift, it's really too much, so many rolls...

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:42.709
over here

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.509
I home I'm lucky with the cops

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.509
I'm not getting the guns

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.109
I prefer a good fist fight

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.279
As is said, camera moving is excessive

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.400
Surviving those jumps is enough

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.439
all yours

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.419
Last race and last jump

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.419
Done

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.419
When the Oculus Rift gets a higher res screen

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.789
and if Mirror's Edge 2 gets native support,

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.789
it will be the first game I'm buying

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:17.210
Level finished!

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.059
This was really intense!

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:25.439
And this was Mirror's Edge on the Oculus Rift with Vireio

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.599
If only the sequel got native support!

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.449
We know EA guys were looking for someone to add native

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.289
Oculus Rift support for the Frostbite engine, so I just can't imagine

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.339
Mirror's Edge 2 and Battlefield 4

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.860
See you soon!
