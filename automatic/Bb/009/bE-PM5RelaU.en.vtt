00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.639
 a 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.090
 well 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.669
 it is 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.879
 it might take some getting used to a conventional looking car like the ford 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.809
 focus 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.609
 see both devices because until now you mainly saw room in between 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.689
 models like the son and the leaf 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.009
 between the ford focus director 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.999
 recognized months other whim 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.239
 the loading ramp input screen m large tractor 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.100
 yes she got in front of you right away 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040
 all blue bars 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 and scores and budgets 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.460
 in fact you can even see butterflies the instruments 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.480
 I do not know that yet tree-quay leaves of all sorts 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.880
 other hybrids and electric cars 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.770
 but get those sentences so if you 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.060
 very economical driving 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.040
 and then you really have to take it really easy to get out of those critters 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.590
 would come 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.870
 the second actually driving in 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.520
 not onto the highway 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520
 to roll out very often 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.490
 then you succeed 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.550
 to keep a nice action radius 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.350
 but you just go away quickly 120 unions 30 hope stampy yes forget it 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.920
 then but by then you also see very quickly that action radius decrease then you also get 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 the 100 plus hardly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.080
 I drive a lot lately 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.390
 win one by coming up with the accelerated approach 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 great find it is a ferry 17 to 18 kilometers on average 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 it is still quite a difference with 162 this area promised 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.490
 I think you can make it but then you don't have to do the canal belt 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.240
 come out of omo laps and amsterdam keep driving and then I console the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.240
 naughty of course the most to his right 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.429
 Ford has developed Telenet 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.169
 when the photos of focus st car was completely finished and that ensured that 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.749
 i just not so smart to go together yes a real electric cars bmw m3 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.109
 Veloso Libya are really a continue as that vision developed 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.159
 years with this the apple had to get a place after true altar boy 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
 put it all the way behind the rear seat backrest 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.299
 because of the club, a fight opens an enormous greenhouse and below that are the batteries 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.760
 that is not only very awkward it also makes for a very strange center of gravity 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.769
 because what is so good at solo is what you actually shit on the battery 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.579
 central in the middle 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.930
 is the heaviest part of the car here is in the back and that ensures 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.599
 that the focus electric just feels very different than a normal focus anyway 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.629
 you are a lot heavier with about 700 kilos 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 he feels a bit soggy 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.060
 in turns you just notice that the 8 is very heavy is very high 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.119
 kortrijk just less than the sheet piles to the nozomi or do a bmw i3 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.049
 in those cars the batteries are actually in the only right place with the luxury car 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.049
 and that is centrally low in the car 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.839
 In addition, it is not too bad the plug should take the time 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.819
 because soon let them continue 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.240
 it can only handle a single phase 32 amp connection 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 I am already half empty with that soon already the fourth needed 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.240
 to get in shape 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.999
 before that she also did the focus in that it is not going to take care of it 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.999
 a breakthrough in the field of electric driving 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.259
 it was a 31,990 euro and with that it's the turn of 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.950
 little crystallized electric cars morning is an unloving oil 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.949
 In addition, you can only get two dealers in the Netherlands 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.110
 This is more a case, for example, electric driving is also important and therefore 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.400
 we have focus director 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.330
 but it is no more than that
