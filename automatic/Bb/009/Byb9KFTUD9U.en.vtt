00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.789
 the first that I thought was 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 wow even before I first use it 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 I went out 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.689
 and after a few lengths I have 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 That's exactly what I am 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 always presented 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.560
 a good seed drill is for me 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.560
 device that I can rely on 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.850
 a device that works exactly and robust 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.850
 is and that's the profile 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 my surfaces are really not the ones 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 easiest but the seeds land 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.229
 nevertheless always exactly where they are 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.229
 belong 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 I was really overwhelmed by that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.580
 Result 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.159
 the profiteers creates such an exact 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.780
 and fine seed groove 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.350
 I do not have that yet 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.350
 seen 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.580
 my surfaces are often not only steep 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.890
 but also hard and dry 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.450
 where many my previous machines already 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.700
 abandoned the profits was the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.720
 first with my bottoms straight away 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.720
 came clear 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.820
 as a farmer I often have many 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670
 different things at once in the head 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.950
 and there it is particularly important that the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.770
 Machine easy and clear too 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.759
 is operating 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.890
 For example, I do not have to anymore 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 climb between tractor and machine 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 i can do the harm quite comfortably and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.880
 safely set from the side 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.740
 I always say the professional grill works 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.670
 not for me but with me 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.670
 that starts with the filling 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.230
 and sowing when I'm out there 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.660
 I am often thinking of the harvest because I am 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.580
 I know what the pros in there and me there 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.580
 will pay later 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.700
 this is not a machine for a couple 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.110
 years 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.790
 this is a machine for the future 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.640
 a machine that I rely on 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.980
 can 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 where the result fits and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.530
 at the same time working with the machine 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.689
 is comfortable and just fun 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.689
 that's the way a seed drill has to be
