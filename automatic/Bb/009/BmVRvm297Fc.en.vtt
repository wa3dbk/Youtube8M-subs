00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.980
 plus 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.930
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970
 virtual class in which I propose a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.070
 series of exercises that will help us 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 develop our muscle memory 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.580
 precision the resistance and in last 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.790
 instance the speed at the time of 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.900
 move around our kit 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.240
 I usually change quite a bit of 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.500
 battery configuration and to help me 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.480
 to feel comfortable the different 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.730
 situations I usually think of figures 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.489
 related to movement and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 sound I want to play this video 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.420
 it does not pretend to be any dogma I 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 I will show for a standard configuration 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 but you will have to adapt it to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.500
 our situation and need you must be 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
 creative I will give you some guidelines so that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 you develop your own 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 exercises I think it's important to explain 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 what are the fundamental principles 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 when designing these exercises the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.860
 first is the relax we should be 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 always as relaxed as possible though 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 this implies giving up in speed the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.190
 main objective of these exercises 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.800
 is to move comfortably through the kit the 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.990
 speed is something secondary nonetheless 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.860
 can be used to write it but 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 always with the principle of maximum relaxation 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.120
 the second principle is that we have to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.590
 maintain our position and despite 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.140
 move in different directions by 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.120
 we should not perform kettledrums 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.690
 strange movements or necessary for 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.940
 do what 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.640
 the third principle is one of consistency with 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.620
 we must isolate ourselves and work 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.840
 each of the figures separately to 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.060
 different speeds and at the time of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.820
 configure a global exercise we will have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.950
 keep in mind which is the one that limits 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.080
 our speed there will be figures that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.100
 we can do 220 and others that only 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.900
 we reached 130 150 those determined the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.310
 maximum speed of the global exercise 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.480
 also if we want to do an exercise of 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.100
 resistance what we should do is 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.130
 go down a bit more to be able to 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.830
 keep us the room longer 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.650
 principle called them 11 means 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.110
 that we will only do simple hits one with 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.790
 the right and one with the left in the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.070
 fifth principle is that there are no 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.750
 Crosses of hands for this we will use three 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.980
 blows in the same drum that we 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.910
 will allow to change direction 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.910
 comfortably 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.180
 plus 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740
 yes 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.200
 these forms are just the point of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.060
 split the Jewish rule the beginning is 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.560
 they must break and you must 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.800
 develop your own exercises 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.190
 remember to be creative there are multiple 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.750
 forms and possibilities for example if 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.880
 we vary the direction of the horseshoe 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.580
 we could have one or one make a c 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.560
 inverted 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.199
 there are more ways than what I propose 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.879
 you can move in horizontal lines 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.349
 horizontals in triangles for example 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.229
 sure that you think of 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.759
 other ways we can break one of the 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.759
 standards and for example have crosses 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.370
 we can also break the hands rule 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.780
 11 that is, we can use rudiments 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.780
 for example the palate the simple 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.970
 and also we could change the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.970
 subdivision and used sixteenths 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.160
 but we could use 6 if you use it 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.320
 that you want 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.930
 surely you can come up with more ideas 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.790
 other examples the case is to design 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.920
 your own exercise that fits 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.840
 to your own needs and 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.240
 situations I hope you liked 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.580
 do not forget to subscribe and the memory 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.800
 how can you continue on facebook twitter 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.240
 youtube and in me of course in my 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.240
 personal page thank you very much
