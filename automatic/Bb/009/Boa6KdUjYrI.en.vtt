but I think a good place they could
start<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.630> meth<00:01:06.860> come<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.189> recent

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
start would be meth come on recent

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
dramas have made it relatable it would

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
dramas have made it relatable it would
be<00:01:11.250> criminalized<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.240> sims<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.689> surely

be criminalized and sims would surely

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.929

little<00:05:05.100> time<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:05.730> can<00:05:05.850> make<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.060> harder<00:05:06.360> to

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
little time so it can make it harder to

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.120 
little time so it can make it harder to
play<00:05:06.690> as<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.020> soon<00:05:07.230> I<00:05:07.440> guess<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:07.980> could

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
play as that soon I guess you could

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.070 
play as that soon I guess you could
always<00:05:08.250> just<00:05:08.580> turn<00:05:08.760> freewill<00:05:09.330> on<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.810> let

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
always just turn freewill on and let

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.190 
always just turn freewill on and let
them<00:05:10.260> be<00:05:10.500> well<00:05:10.710> free<00:05:11.460> or<00:05:12.300> you<00:05:12.720> can<00:05:12.900> keep<00:05:13.050> them

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
them be well free or you can keep them

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.720 
them be well free or you can keep them
under<00:05:13.440> your<00:05:13.470> oppressive<00:05:14.040> thumb<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.550> rest

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
under your oppressive thumb for the rest

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.000 
under your oppressive thumb for the rest
of<00:05:14.850> their<00:05:15.030> worthless<00:05:15.240> little<00:05:15.600> lives<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.350> think

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
of their worthless little lives I think

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.500 
of their worthless little lives I think
it<00:05:17.100> would<00:05:17.190> be<00:05:17.280> cool<00:05:17.490> turning<00:05:17.970> freewill<00:05:18.330> off

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
it would be cool turning freewill off

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.180 
it would be cool turning freewill off
and<00:05:18.720> repeatedly<00:05:19.140> forcing<00:05:19.620> your<00:05:19.740> sim<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:19.980> get

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
and repeatedly forcing your sim to get

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
and repeatedly forcing your sim to get
stoned<00:05:20.460> from<00:05:20.640> LSD

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
stoned from LSD

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.360 
stoned from LSD
I<00:05:21.480> wonder<00:05:22.140> how<00:05:22.230> they'd<00:05:22.380> be<00:05:22.410> affected<00:05:23.010> by<00:05:23.130> that

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
I wonder how they'd be affected by that

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.520 
I wonder how they'd be affected by that
they'd<00:05:24.120> have<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.330> green<00:05:24.660> movement<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.290> says

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
they'd have a green movement that says

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.250 
they'd have a green movement that says
tripping<00:05:26.040> balls<00:05:26.280> on<00:05:26.790> it<00:05:26.820> good<00:05:27.780> for<00:05:27.990> several

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
tripping balls on it good for several

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.230 
tripping balls on it good for several
hours<00:05:28.410> at<00:05:28.830> least<00:05:28.860> but<00:05:29.820> do<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.180> think

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
hours at least but do you think

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.110 
hours at least but do you think
teenagers<00:05:30.990> could<00:05:31.380> use<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.740> in<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.919> game<00:05:32.120> it

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
teenagers could use it in the game it

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.880 
teenagers could use it in the game it
would<00:05:33.240> only<00:05:33.360> make<00:05:33.690> sense<00:05:33.750> having<00:05:34.290> teenagers

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
would only make sense having teenagers

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.740 
would only make sense having teenagers
getting<00:05:35.130> involved<00:05:35.610> with<00:05:35.669> drugs<00:05:36.060> but<00:05:36.690> I

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
getting involved with drugs but I

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.300 
getting involved with drugs but I
haven't<00:05:37.169> heard<00:05:37.350> of<00:05:37.410> many<00:05:37.530> teenagers<00:05:38.100> getting

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
haven't heard of many teenagers getting

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.240 
haven't heard of many teenagers getting
addicted<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.850> LSD<00:05:39.270> lately<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.229> just<00:05:40.620> seems<00:05:41.070> a

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
addicted to LSD lately it just seems a

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.580 
addicted to LSD lately it just seems a
little<00:05:41.430> bit<00:05:41.669> too<00:05:41.790> far<00:05:42.210> off<00:05:42.330> base<00:05:42.690> I<00:05:43.080> don't

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
little bit too far off base I don't

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.110 
little bit too far off base I don't
think<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:43.860> many<00:05:43.979> teenagers<00:05:44.460> were<00:05:44.760> connect

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
think that many teenagers were connect

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000 
think that many teenagers were connect
with<00:05:45.270> a<00:05:45.360> sim<00:05:45.600> who's<00:05:45.780> hooked<00:05:45.990> on<00:05:46.140> acid<00:05:46.560> you're

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
with a sim who's hooked on acid you're

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.340 
with a sim who's hooked on acid you're
right<00:05:47.280> but<00:05:48.030> they<00:05:48.180> would<00:05:48.390> connect<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.840> a<00:05:48.960> sim

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
right but they would connect to a sim

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.960 
right but they would connect to a sim
