00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.740
 Hello good friends this videoblog 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.450
 week has obviously been news 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 absolute manifestation 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.750
 independence 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.750
 successful independence demonstration in 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.250
 the dyad 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.170
 many people say man is not 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.680
 pro-independence is in favor of a 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.180
 referendum for independence I almost 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000
 I am convinced that someone who is 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.640
 sum to a chain to cross a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
 entire territory with a flag 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.220
 estelada if on the chest I think it's going to 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.629
 vote if I believe that the thing is like 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.760
 Catalan a lot of people ask me what 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 do you think of independence 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.450
 my opinion is 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.910
 that I am completely in favor of the 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.420
 people who are against the current 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.950
 state of things but that maybe I think 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.470
 that independence would not be the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.810
 solution because basically what is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.810
 claims from Catalonia is what 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.640
 we all claim live where we live 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:19.020
 a fairer state a better situation 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 labor and economic, less cuts in 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 end more respect end a series of things 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 in which everyone could be of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.820
 agreement from there to the best is 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.830
 an exit not independence but yes 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 a little bit what he said dedicating that is 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.550
 when a very big problem when we 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.399
 we face a system that does not 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.320
 like I do not mean Spain anymore but 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.390
 this Europe that we have that does not like to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 nobody the fear europe of the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.440
 appearance of the cuts of the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.710
 sinvergonzonerÃ­a del menos came dead 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.690
 of that Europe at the best the way is 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.040
 divide that was a problem in small 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.500
 problems 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.820
 then maybe in Catalonia they come up with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.910
 a series of solutions for your 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.130
 problems that then in the Basque country 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.540
 You can also find in Galicia 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240
 can find in madrid power 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.580
 find in andalusia if we go 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.149
 we dismantled everything let's say to return it to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.390
 mount 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.340
 I do not see it that crazy , we did it afterwards 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.739
 from Mr. Este who was not on a diet 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.959
 40 years we reached an agreement to 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.030
 establish a cohabitation pact 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.620
 better is the time to go back to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.390
 establish a new covenant agreement 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.689
 between the territories that form Spain 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.159
 and from there to reach a pact of 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.700
 better cohabitation between the territories 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.680
 that make europe so that I 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.629
 Independence of Spain I do not see it 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 solution but the independence of 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.200
 current state of things 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.030
 Yes because I understand that people join 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.739
 to that because in the end people add to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.989
 anything that gives hope and if 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.940
 not how it is explained is that people 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.459
 will support an Olympic Games 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.680
 even led by ana bottle is by 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.090
 the illusion we need illusion for the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 better with goodbye minutes
