Steven Gerrard we're going to go off for

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.890 
Steven Gerrard we're going to go off for
the<00:04:32.890> night<00:04:33.340> we're<00:04:34.210> going<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.390> offer<00:04:34.540> them<00:04:34.690> man

the night we're going to offer them man

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.150 
the night we're going to offer them man
of<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.050> match<00:04:35.670> or<00:04:36.670> grid<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.180> him<00:04:37.560> at<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.830> M<00:04:39.010> and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
of the match or grid on him at the M and

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.990 
of the match or grid on him at the M and
I<00:04:39.190> think<00:04:39.340> he's<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.790> trade<00:04:40.570> in<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:42.010> DM<00:04:42.610> position

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
I think he's a trade in the DM position

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.210 
I think he's a trade in the DM position
and<00:04:43.900> his<00:04:43.990> value<00:04:44.350> is<00:04:44.410> quite<00:04:44.590> good<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.950> card

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
and his value is quite good and the card

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.450 
and his value is quite good and the card
looks<00:04:45.460> quite<00:04:45.700> nice<00:04:45.880> as<00:04:46.120> well<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:48.100> there<00:04:48.250> he<00:04:48.370> is

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
looks quite nice as well so there he is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.270 
looks quite nice as well so there he is
150<00:04:49.390> k<00:04:49.600> his<00:04:49.870> value<00:04:50.290> when<00:04:50.710> we<00:04:50.860> do<00:04:51.040> play<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
150 k his value when we do play the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.540 
150 k his value when we do play the
games<00:04:51.490> played<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.180> game<00:04:52.360> now<00:04:53.080> do<00:04:53.400> take<00:04:54.400> it

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
games played the game now do take it

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.490
