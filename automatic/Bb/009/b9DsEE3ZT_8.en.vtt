00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
getting that that meant I have every

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
getting that that meant I have every
requirement<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> quest<00:01:25.979> ritual<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
requirement for the quest ritual to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.630 
requirement for the quest ritual to
moderate<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.710> believe<00:01:29.280> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
moderate so now I have I believe just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
moderate so now I have I believe just
about<00:01:29.850> every<00:01:30.090> requirement<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.689> every<00:01:30.900> quest

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
about every requirement for every quest

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.289 
about every requirement for every quest
in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> game<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
in the game and if not if I don't have

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
in the game and if not if I don't have
that<00:01:33.450> already<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.079> very<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.680> close<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that already then I'm very very close I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.069 
that already then I'm very very close I
think<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.030> might<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.810> 82

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think I might have to have like 82

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
think I might have to have like 82
thieving<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.680> something<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.100> requests<00:01:38.460> but

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
thieving or something for requests but

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
thieving or something for requests but
all<00:01:39.420> across<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.869> bridge<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.380> come<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
all across that bridge when I come to I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
all across that bridge when I come to I
should<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> pretty<00:01:41.430> soon<00:01:41.579> anyway<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
should have that pretty soon anyway and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.230 
should have that pretty soon anyway and
then<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.810> 76<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> 77<00:01:43.920> mining<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.880> went<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
then from 76 to 77 mining I just went to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.429 
then from 76 to 77 mining I just went to
mine<00:01:45.479> granite<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.290> actually

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
mine granite because it's actually

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.350 
mine granite because it's actually
pretty<00:01:46.829> profitable<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:47.939> wish<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.210> knew

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
pretty profitable I really wish I knew

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
pretty profitable I really wish I knew
about<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.720> before<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.920> someone<00:01:50.220> told<00:01:50.460> me<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
about this before but someone told me I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.280 
about this before but someone told me I
believe<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> comments<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
livestream or something that I should

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.520 
livestream or something that I should
try<00:01:54.060> mining<00:01:54.420> granite<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.079> training<00:01:55.380> money

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
really boring and I know barbarian

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.930 
really boring and I know barbarian
assault<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.390> quite<00:02:21.630> fast<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.650> get<00:02:23.130> bonus<00:02:23.460> xp<00:02:23.820> in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.280 
assault is quite fast to get bonus xp in
but<00:02:24.120> at<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.360> same<00:02:24.510> time<00:02:24.720> barbarian<00:02:25.170> assault

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
but at the same time barbarian assault

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
but at the same time barbarian assault
is<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.680> difficult<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.070> find<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.370> team<00:02:26.580> with

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
is just difficult to find a team with

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
is just difficult to find a team with
and<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.420> very<00:02:27.720> fun<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.860> again<00:02:29.160> I'm<00:02:29.400> very

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and it's not very fun so again I'm very

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.190 
and it's not very fun so again I'm very
getting<00:02:30.150> very<00:02:30.330> very<00:02:30.390> close<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.870> those<00:02:30.960> 80

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
getting very very close to those 80

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.560 
getting very very close to those 80
skills<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.860> did<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.250> four<00:02:32.670> skills<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.390> 80

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
skills and I did get four skills to 80

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.060 
skills and I did get four skills to 80
in<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:34.200> week<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.710> pretty<00:02:34.740> awesome

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
in one week which is pretty awesome

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.790 
in one week which is pretty awesome
which<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.730> believe<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.150> only<00:02:36.630> have<00:02:37.050> five<00:02:37.410> skills

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
which I believe I only have five skills

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.950 
which I believe I only have five skills
left<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.220> go<00:02:38.340> till<00:02:38.550> 80<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.690> them<00:02:39.840> is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
left to go till 80 and one of them is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.900 
left to go till 80 and one of them is
really<00:02:40.200> really<00:02:40.470> easy<00:02:40.710> as<00:02:41.040> well<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.490> it's

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
really really easy as well so it's

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.240 
really really easy as well so it's
pretty<00:02:42.060> much<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.270> fishing<00:02:43.250> mining

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
pretty much just fishing mining

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.480 
pretty much just fishing mining
runecrafting<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.770> what<00:02:46.770> else<00:02:46.920> leaving<00:02:47.190> that

enough money to Train herb or so I'm

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.300 
enough money to Train herb or so I'm
probably<00:03:43.110> going<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.440> be<00:03:43.500> making<00:03:43.680> superstores

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
probably going to be making superstores

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.830 
probably going to be making superstores
actually<00:03:44.670> did<00:03:44.790> some<00:03:44.910> calculations<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.540> super

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
actually did some calculations and super

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.510 
actually did some calculations and super
restores<00:03:46.170> are<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.350> bit<00:03:46.590> cheaper<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:47.070> make<00:03:47.220> then

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
restores are a bit cheaper to make then

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.250 
restores are a bit cheaper to make then

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
using your obviously super texture a lot

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.060 
using your obviously super texture a lot
cheaper<00:03:51.239> but<00:03:51.570> with<00:03:52.170> using<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:52.590> since<00:03:52.950> you

cheaper but with using your since you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.090 
cheaper but with using your since you
save<00:03:53.450> well<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.600> get<00:03:54.750> more<00:03:54.989> XP<00:03:55.470> bonus<00:03:55.650> from<00:03:56.040> the

save well you get more XP bonus from the
ore<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.520> actually<00:03:56.910> it's<00:03:57.120> cheaper<00:03:57.750> that's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
ore you actually it's cheaper that's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.540 
ore you actually it's cheaper that's
just<00:03:58.170> kind<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.350> how<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.560> works<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.950> then<00:03:59.370> also

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
just kind of how it works and then also

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.130 
just kind of how it works and then also
um<00:03:59.940> even<00:04:00.450> though<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.570> already<00:04:00.690> had<00:04:00.930> eighty

Titan just helps out a bit with mine

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.910 
Titan just helps out a bit with mine
they're<00:04:12.420> also<00:04:12.720> easier<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.350> buy<00:04:13.500> than<00:04:13.739> like

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
they're also easier to buy than like

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.949 
they're also easier to buy than like
obsidian<00:04:14.220> golem<00:04:14.760> pouches<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.269> they<00:04:15.810> give

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
obsidian golem pouches and they give

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.300 
obsidian golem pouches and they give
more<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.290> mining<00:04:16.590> boost<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:16.980> that's<00:04:17.130> why<00:04:17.280> I

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
more of a mining boost so that's why I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.650 
more of a mining boost so that's why I
wanted<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.640> get<00:04:17.760> 83<00:04:18.120> somebody<00:04:18.390> out<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.600> way

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
wanted to get 83 somebody out of the way

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.750 
wanted to get 83 somebody out of the way
and<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.870> did<00:04:19.049> get<00:04:19.260> 83<00:04:19.739> some<00:04:19.919> even<00:04:20.640> though<00:04:20.730> I

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
and I did get 83 some even though I

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.630 
and I did get 83 some even though I
don't<00:04:20.880> show<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.600> because<00:04:22.310> I'm<00:04:23.310> not<00:04:23.370> sure

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
don't show it just because I'm not sure

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.610 
don't show it just because I'm not sure
why<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:23.880> missed<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.690> 83<00:04:25.140> something<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.470> think

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
why I missed the 83 something I think

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.640 
why I missed the 83 something I think
it's<00:04:25.740> because<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.100> had<00:04:26.430> bonus<00:04:26.789> xp<00:04:27.120> or<00:04:27.240> something

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
it's because I had bonus xp or something

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.610 
it's because I had bonus xp or something
and<00:04:27.770> then<00:04:27.919> I<00:04:28.100> had<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> exact<00:04:28.759> amount<00:04:29.090> of

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
and then I had the exact amount of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.379 
and then I had the exact amount of
granite<00:04:30.620> lobsters<00:04:31.070> banked<00:04:31.699> that<00:04:31.759> I<00:04:31.910> needed<00:04:32.180> to

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
granite lobsters banked that I needed to

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.999 
granite lobsters banked that I needed to
get<00:04:32.509> 83<00:04:32.930> summer<00:04:33.110> but<00:04:33.380> since<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.680> had<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.830> little

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
get 83 summer but since I had a little

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.430 
get 83 summer but since I had a little
bit<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.190> bonus<00:04:34.490> xp<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.910> threw<00:04:35.150> me<00:04:35.300> off<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:36.289> so<00:04:36.410> I

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
bit of bonus xp it threw me off and so I

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.570 
bit of bonus xp it threw me off and so I
got<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.740> love<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:36.919> little<00:04:37.009> bit<00:04:37.130> earlier<00:04:37.400> than<00:04:37.490> I

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
got the love a little bit earlier than I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.350 
got the love a little bit earlier than I
was<00:04:37.669> expecting<00:04:37.759> to

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
was expecting to

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.060 
was expecting to
and<00:04:38.509> there's<00:04:38.840> 83<00:04:39.229> herb-lore<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:39.710> that's<00:04:39.889> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
and there's 83 herb-lore so that's the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.950 
and there's 83 herb-lore so that's the
highest<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.520> got<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.910> got<00:04:41.120> four<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.930> half

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
highest that I got I got four and a half

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.409 
highest that I got I got four and a half
basically<00:04:42.800> herb<00:04:43.250> low<00:04:43.370> levels<00:04:43.729> using<00:04:44.120> my<00:04:44.240> aura

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
basically herb low levels using my aura

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.840 
basically herb low levels using my aura
and<00:04:44.919> again<00:04:45.919> super<00:04:46.220> attacks<00:04:46.430> are<00:04:46.550> pretty<00:04:46.699> fast

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and again super attacks are pretty fast

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.640 
and again super attacks are pretty fast
they're<00:04:47.090> about<00:04:47.240> 500<00:04:47.750> k<00:04:47.900> XP<00:04:48.110> an<00:04:48.320> hour

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
they're about 500 k XP an hour

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.200 
they're about 500 k XP an hour
what's<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.009> aura<00:04:49.190> but<00:04:49.520> I'm<00:04:49.639> gonna<00:04:49.759> be<00:04:49.940> using

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
what's the aura but I'm gonna be using

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.610 
what's the aura but I'm gonna be using
super<00:04:50.539> restores<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.080> future<00:04:51.320> which<00:04:51.500> are

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
super restores in the future which are

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.770 
super restores in the future which are
gonna<00:04:51.740> be<00:04:51.830> more<00:04:52.100> like<00:04:52.250> 650<00:04:53.150> K<00:04:53.330> hit<00:04:53.479> an<00:04:53.630> hour

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
gonna be more like 650 K hit an hour

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.999 
gonna be more like 650 K hit an hour
using<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.320> aura<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:54.590> they're<00:04:54.740> gonna<00:04:54.860> be<00:04:54.979> very

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
using the aura so they're gonna be very

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.580 
using the aura so they're gonna be very
very<00:04:55.490> fast<00:04:55.759> and<00:04:56.600> again<00:04:56.840> here's<00:04:57.110> another<00:04:57.169> tech

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
very fast and again here's another tech

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.020 
very fast and again here's another tech
hold<00:04:57.770> so<00:04:57.860> these<00:04:57.949> two<00:04:58.160> tackles<00:04:58.430> were<00:04:58.699> glitched

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
hold so these two tackles were glitched

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.150 
hold so these two tackles were glitched
the<00:04:59.449> first<00:04:59.750> one<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.020> saw<00:05:00.169> it<00:05:00.350> said<00:05:00.470> 82<00:05:00.889> on<00:05:01.070> the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
the first one you saw it said 82 on the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.920 
the first one you saw it said 82 on the
screen<00:05:01.460> even<00:05:01.970> though<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.090> was<00:05:02.210> getting<00:05:02.389> 83<00:05:02.750> and

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
screen even though I was getting 83 and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.060 
screen even though I was getting 83 and
then<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:03.169> one<00:05:03.320> that<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.500> see<00:05:03.650> here<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:04.039> says

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
then this one that you see here it says

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.790 
then this one that you see here it says
83<00:05:04.699> even<00:05:05.360> though<00:05:05.449> I'm<00:05:05.570> actually<00:05:05.750> getting<00:05:06.199> 84

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
83 even though I'm actually getting 84

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.010 
83 even though I'm actually getting 84
text<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:07.550> kind<00:05:07.729> of<00:05:07.789> weird<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.690> happens

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
text so it's kind of weird that happens
