That's huge ! What are you doing here ? 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.010
This is my studio !

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.380
Do you want to come inside ?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.430
Here you are in my place, nobody ever gets in here

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.500
This is my office

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:48.465

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.325

00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:52.325

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.990

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.005
Since Far L'amore means making love 

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.745
I don't know what about you but

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:04.650

Martin: well nice!It's kind of a weird

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:21.015
Can I ask you some questions ? 

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.015
Bob Sinclar : Of course! Have a seat.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.175
Okay, so I m going to act like if it was

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:30.175
a "serious" meeting

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.720
So, tell us. What's new about you ?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.190
Well, there is far l'amore, featuring an Italian 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.925
Singer, a real icone during the 80's

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:45.655
I chose to let the song in Italian

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.010
because I thought it was funny. 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.315
And in France Italian song always scored 

00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:53.095
The begining is promising ! 

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:54.790
Then we have the album

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.790
Scheduled around october

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.180
My huge summer tour, 40 dates !

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.335
Are you going to Ibiza ?

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:04.335
Of course. 6 or 7 times I think

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:06.335
it's going to be quite amazing 

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.100

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.810
But to use it, you need an iphone

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.820
Martin: True. But I see 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.820
an iPhone here right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.990
Yes there is an Iphone indeed

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.930
Martin: Maybe we could do 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930
some kind of contest ?

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.930

It's improvisation but we

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:48.645
are going to figure out a contest

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.645

00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:56.645
set a serious contest

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:58.645

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:51.085

00:04:07.815 --> 00:04:09.815
As soon as we get 1 million fans

00:04:13.815 --> 00:04:15.530
