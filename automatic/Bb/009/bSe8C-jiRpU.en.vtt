crowded together I could be feeling a

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.609 
crowded together I could be feeling a
lot<00:00:21.700> of<00:00:21.820> positive<00:00:22.360> energy<00:00:22.779> of<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.020> people<00:00:23.170> or

I can be feeling drained it depends on

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.140 
I can be feeling drained it depends on

strategies<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:29.290> bring<00:00:29.529> positive<00:00:29.800> energy<00:00:30.160> in

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
strategies to bring positive energy in

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.040 
strategies to bring positive energy in
their<00:00:30.730> life<00:00:30.910> they<00:00:31.180> just<00:00:31.360> won't<00:00:31.480> do<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.750> on

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
their life they just won't do it on

their life they just won't do it on
their<00:00:32.259> own<00:00:32.290> I<00:00:33.960> Center<00:00:34.960> myself<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.739> I<00:00:35.770> breathe

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
their own I Center myself and I breathe

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.910 
their own I Center myself and I breathe
and<00:00:36.250> I<00:00:36.340> walk<00:00:36.520> through<00:00:36.820> all<00:00:36.940> this<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.860> people

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
and I walk through all this when people

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.040 
and I walk through all this when people
are<00:00:39.550> tense<00:00:39.910> they<00:00:40.210> tend<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.510> hold<00:00:40.660> their<00:00:40.840> breath

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
are tense they tend to hold their breath

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.130 
are tense they tend to hold their breath
and<00:00:41.380> that<00:00:42.010> lodges<00:00:42.699> negative<00:00:43.120> energy<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:43.870> take

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
and that lodges negative energy so take

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.259 
and that lodges negative energy so take
a<00:00:44.170> breath<00:00:44.469> breathe<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.340> out<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.760> there's<00:00:46.090> also

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:46.269 
a breath breathe it out and there's also

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:48.360 
a breath breathe it out and there's also
a<00:00:46.420> shielding<00:00:47.050> technique<00:00:47.530> where<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:47.949> actually

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
a shielding technique where you actually

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.580 
a shielding technique where you actually
visualize<00:00:49.030> white<00:00:49.480> light<00:00:49.750> all<00:00:50.079> around<00:00:50.140> your

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
visualize white light all around your

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.740 
visualize white light all around your
body<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:51.070> creates<00:00:51.399> an<00:00:51.609> energy<00:00:52.030> shield<00:00:52.329> if<00:00:52.660> you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
body it creates an energy shield if you

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.990 
body it creates an energy shield if you
have<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.960> walk<00:00:53.140> in<00:00:53.350> traffic<00:00:53.829> put<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.550> shield

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
have to walk in traffic put a shield

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.669 
have to walk in traffic put a shield
around<00:00:55.570> your<00:00:55.750> body<00:00:55.929> and<00:00:56.230> this<00:00:56.320> will<00:00:56.500> protect

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
around your body and this will protect

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.970 
around your body and this will protect

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
you it's like a buffer a cocoon if you

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.250 
you it's like a buffer a cocoon if you
take<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.219> look<00:01:00.519> at<00:01:00.609> this<00:01:00.730> beautiful<00:01:01.089> salad<00:01:01.570> it

high energy foods that will give you
energy<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.230> you<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.440> feel<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:08.980> your<00:01:09.100> body

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
energy and you can feel it in your body

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.899 
energy and you can feel it in your body
you<00:01:10.330> eat<00:01:10.659> an<00:01:10.930> orange<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.860> see<00:01:11.890> how<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.250> feel

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
you eat an orange you see how you feel

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.600 
you eat an orange you see how you feel
energetically<00:01:13.720> versus<00:01:14.500> string<00:01:14.890> beans<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:15.550> do

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
energetically versus string beans how do

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.400 
energetically versus string beans how do
you<00:01:15.790> feel<00:01:16.060> energetically<00:01:16.840> with<00:01:16.960> string<00:01:17.230> beans

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
you feel energetically with string beans

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.560 
you feel energetically with string beans
and<00:01:17.620> you<00:01:17.680> find<00:01:17.980> a<00:01:18.100> diet<00:01:18.400> that's<00:01:18.790> consistent

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
and you find a diet that's consistent

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.280 
and you find a diet that's consistent
with<00:01:20.140> a<00:01:20.170> high<00:01:20.470> energy<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:21.220> your<00:01:21.400> body<00:01:22.290> ideally

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
with a high energy in your body ideally

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.140 
with a high energy in your body ideally
if<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.440> eat<00:01:23.860> for<00:01:24.160> energy<00:01:24.640> then<00:01:24.880> you'll<00:01:25.030> be

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
if you eat for energy then you'll be

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.950 
if you eat for energy then you'll be
feeling<00:01:25.480> better

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
feeling better

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.870 
feeling better
and<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.560> course<00:01:26.800> high<00:01:27.010> energy<00:01:27.430> foods<00:01:27.700> will

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and of course high energy foods will

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
and of course high energy foods will
often<00:01:28.150> taste<00:01:28.390> good<00:01:28.690> too

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
often taste good too

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.180 
often taste good too
negative<00:01:30.280> energy<00:01:30.640> means<00:01:31.330> fear<00:01:32.190> contractions

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
negative energy means fear contractions

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.760 
negative energy means fear contractions
shame<00:01:33.580> self-loathing<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.960> kind<00:01:35.260> of<00:01:35.350> energy

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
shame self-loathing that kind of energy

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.010 
shame self-loathing that kind of energy
that<00:01:35.800> we<00:01:36.100> literally<00:01:36.430> hold<00:01:36.850> inside<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.630> us<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that we literally hold inside of us and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.340 
that we literally hold inside of us and
so<00:01:38.650> one<00:01:38.830> thing<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:39.070> suggest<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.820> shame<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.840> to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
so one thing I suggest for shame is to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.080 
so one thing I suggest for shame is to
go<00:01:41.470> out<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.830> pick<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.040> couple<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.730> different

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
go out and pick a couple of different

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.810 
go out and pick a couple of different
flowers<00:01:43.450> maybe<00:01:43.660> ten<00:01:43.990> flowers<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.710> name<00:01:45.310> your

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
flowers maybe ten flowers and name your

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.660 
flowers maybe ten flowers and name your
shames<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:47.080> will<00:01:47.200> lift<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:48.130> shame<00:01:48.400> when

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
shames and it will lift the shame when

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.070 
shames and it will lift the shame when
you<00:01:48.790> see<00:01:48.940> something<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:49.480> beautiful<00:01:49.990> as<00:01:50.050> a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
you see something so beautiful as a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.130 
you see something so beautiful as a
flower<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.680> associate<00:01:51.190> it<00:01:51.340> with<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.580> shame
