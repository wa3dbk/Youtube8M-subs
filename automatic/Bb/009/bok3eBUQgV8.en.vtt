particularly<00:00:49.220> talking<00:00:49.760> about<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.360> tremolo

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
particularly talking about the tremolo

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.440 
particularly talking about the tremolo
the<00:00:51.710> tremolo<00:00:51.950> will<00:00:52.310> feel<00:00:52.580> familiar<00:00:53.090> if<00:00:53.300> you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
the tremolo will feel familiar if you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.940 
the tremolo will feel familiar if you
played<00:00:53.690> tremolo<00:00:54.110> equipped<00:00:54.380> guitars<00:00:54.740> in<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
played tremolo equipped guitars in the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.770 
played tremolo equipped guitars in the
past<00:00:55.220> because<00:00:55.880> Taylor<00:00:56.180> tried<00:00:56.330> to<00:00:56.420> honor<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
past because Taylor tried to honor the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.450 
past because Taylor tried to honor the
heritage<00:00:57.140> of<00:00:57.500> some<00:00:57.800> other<00:00:57.920> builders<00:00:58.310> in<00:00:58.400> the

however in true Taylor form there are
some<00:01:07.609> design<00:01:07.880> tweaks<00:01:08.380> namely<00:01:09.380> we<00:01:09.590> lowered<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
some design tweaks namely we lowered the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.649 
some design tweaks namely we lowered the
fulcrum<00:01:10.369> point<00:01:10.640> now<00:01:10.969> it's<00:01:11.119> a<00:01:11.210> knife-edge

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
fulcrum point now it's a knife-edge

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.389 
fulcrum point now it's a knife-edge
fulcrum<00:01:12.200> style<00:01:12.469> tremolo<00:01:12.890> which<00:01:13.039> means<00:01:13.280> a

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
fulcrum style tremolo which means a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.730 
fulcrum style tremolo which means a
fulcrum<00:01:13.759> who<00:01:14.270> acts<00:01:14.450> as<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.659> pivot<00:01:14.899> we<00:01:15.439> lowered

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
fulcrum who acts as a pivot we lowered

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.169 
fulcrum who acts as a pivot we lowered
that<00:01:15.799> fulcrum<00:01:16.280> point<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.700> try<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:16.969> create<00:01:17.090> a

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
that fulcrum point to try and create a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.239 
that fulcrum point to try and create a
more<00:01:17.359> balanced<00:01:17.840> feel<00:01:18.109> to<00:01:18.590> make<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.890> feel<00:01:19.070> more

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
more balanced feel to make it feel more

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.489 
more balanced feel to make it feel more
fluid<00:01:19.429> anytime<00:01:20.359> you're<00:01:20.509> playing<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.990> tremolo

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
fluid anytime you're playing a tremolo

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.590 
fluid anytime you're playing a tremolo
equipped<00:01:21.799> guitar<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.640> real<00:01:22.880> goal<00:01:23.179> is<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.479> have

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
equipped guitar the real goal is to have

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.539 
equipped guitar the real goal is to have
it<00:01:23.659> return<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> zero<00:01:24.530> point<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.039> by<00:01:25.249> zero

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
it return to a zero point and by zero

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.249 
it return to a zero point and by zero
point<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.030> mean<00:01:26.240> have<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.570> guitar<00:01:26.689> come<00:01:27.020> back

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
point we mean have the guitar come back

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.169 
point we mean have the guitar come back
to<00:01:27.469> being<00:01:27.649> in<00:01:27.770> tune<00:01:28.009> after<00:01:28.280> you're<00:01:28.820> done<00:01:28.939> using

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
to being in tune after you're done using

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.300 
to being in tune after you're done using
the<00:01:29.420> tremolo<00:01:29.719> now<00:01:30.289> lowering<00:01:30.679> that<00:01:30.829> fulcrum

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the tremolo now lowering that fulcrum

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.889 
the tremolo now lowering that fulcrum
point<00:01:31.340> contributes<00:01:32.329> to<00:01:32.509> bring<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.810> guitar

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
point contributes to bring the guitar

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.809 
point contributes to bring the guitar
back<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.439> zero<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.369> just<00:01:34.549> feels<00:01:34.729> more

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
back to zero and it just feels more

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.940 
back to zero and it just feels more
comfortable<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.569> play<00:01:35.840> one<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.649> things<00:01:36.799> I

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
comfortable to play one of the things I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.260 
comfortable to play one of the things I
like<00:01:37.130> about<00:01:37.249> the<00:01:37.399> Taylor<00:01:37.670> tremolo<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.179> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
like about the Taylor tremolo is that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.029 
like about the Taylor tremolo is that
you<00:01:38.359> can<00:01:38.509> set<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.749> up<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.869> float<00:01:39.200> or<00:01:39.409> bottom<00:01:39.890> out

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
you can set it up to float or bottom out

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.039 
you can set it up to float or bottom out
now<00:01:40.460> if<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.609> float<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.149> mean<00:01:41.329> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.569> pull<00:01:41.780> up<00:01:41.810> on

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
now if I float I mean you can pull up on

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.569 
now if I float I mean you can pull up on
the<00:01:42.170> arm<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.649> make<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.039> pitch<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.340> all<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
the arm and make the pitch of all the

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.160 
the arm and make the pitch of all the
strings<00:01:43.819> go<00:01:43.999> up<00:01:44.179> or<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.420> could<00:01:44.749> push<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.020> down

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
strings go up or you could push it down

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.779 
strings go up or you could push it down
on<00:01:45.319> the<00:01:45.409> arm<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.799> make<00:01:46.130> all<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.429> pitch<00:01:46.579> of<00:01:46.700> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
on the arm and make all the pitch of the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.270 
on the arm and make all the pitch of the
strings<00:01:46.850> go<00:01:47.270> down<00:01:47.509> when<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.200> say<00:01:48.499> bottom<00:01:48.889> out<00:01:49.039> I

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
strings go down when I say bottom out I

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.609 
strings go down when I say bottom out I
mean<00:01:49.639> you<00:01:49.789> can<00:01:49.939> pull<00:01:50.210> up<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:51.350> doesn't

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
mean you can pull up and it doesn't

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.109 
mean you can pull up and it doesn't
really<00:01:51.740> go<00:01:51.950> anywhere<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.880> still

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
really go anywhere and you can still

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.429 
really go anywhere and you can still
have<00:01:53.210> plenty<00:01:53.359> of<00:01:53.539> travel<00:01:53.749> as<00:01:53.929> you<00:01:54.049> push<00:01:54.229> down

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
have plenty of travel as you push down

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.379 
have plenty of travel as you push down
