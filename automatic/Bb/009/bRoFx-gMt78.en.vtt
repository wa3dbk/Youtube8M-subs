my history as a card stacker is kind of

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.690 
my history as a card stacker is kind of
a<00:00:03.270> very<00:00:04.200> long<00:00:04.529> one<00:00:04.799> I've<00:00:05.069> been<00:00:05.220> doing<00:00:05.279> it

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
a very long one I've been doing it

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.670 
a very long one I've been doing it
pretty<00:00:06.299> much<00:00:06.540> as<00:00:06.750> long<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.440> can<00:00:07.649> remember

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
pretty much as long as I can remember

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.790 
pretty much as long as I can remember
and<00:00:08.309> first<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.360> would<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:10.050> know<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.530> deck

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and first I would have you know one deck

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.160 
and first I would have you know one deck
and<00:00:11.099> then<00:00:11.250> five<00:00:11.610> decks<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.269> then<00:00:12.450> ten<00:00:12.870> decks

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
and then five decks and then ten decks

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.870 
and then five decks and then ten decks
and<00:00:13.469> then<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> hundred<00:00:14.009> decks<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.730> then

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
and then a hundred decks and then

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:24.480 
and then a hundred decks and then
hundreds<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.750> decks

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.470 

my<00:00:25.490> first<00:00:25.850> project<00:00:26.660> in<00:00:27.020> South<00:00:27.260> America<00:00:27.830> and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
my first project in South America and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.690 
my first project in South America and
certainly<00:00:29.480> my<00:00:29.750> first<00:00:29.960> time<00:00:30.200> in<00:00:30.470> Brazil<00:00:30.700> we

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
certainly my first time in Brazil we

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.869 
certainly my first time in Brazil we
thought<00:00:32.000> a<00:00:32.029> lot<00:00:32.119> about<00:00:32.300> what<00:00:33.250> we<00:00:34.250> should<00:00:34.700> build

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
thought a lot about what we should build

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.140 
thought a lot about what we should build
to<00:00:35.840> kind<00:00:36.050> of<00:00:36.110> symbolize<00:00:36.430> Sao<00:00:37.430> Paulo<00:00:37.670> and

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
to kind of symbolize Sao Paulo and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.500 
to kind of symbolize Sao Paulo and
Brazil<00:00:38.620> but<00:00:39.620> there<00:00:40.430> are<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.519> lot<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.760> debate

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
Brazil but there are a lot of debate

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920 
Brazil but there are a lot of debate
about<00:00:41.720> what<00:00:42.230> it<00:00:42.350> would<00:00:42.500> be<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.780> among<00:00:44.780> the

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
about what it would be and among the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.710 
about what it would be and among the
ideas<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.650> I<00:00:45.680> put<00:00:46.489> forward<00:00:46.820> where's<00:00:47.330> the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
ideas that I put forward where's the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.130 
ideas that I put forward where's the
Metropolitan<00:00:48.710> Cathedral<00:00:49.309> just<00:00:49.879> because<00:00:50.300> the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
Metropolitan Cathedral just because the

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.630 
Metropolitan Cathedral just because the
Cathedral<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.769> kind<00:00:52.070> of<00:00:52.220> an<00:00:52.309> impossible

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
Cathedral is kind of an impossible

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.579 
Cathedral is kind of an impossible
building<00:00:53.559> anyway<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.370> even<00:00:55.699> more

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
building anyway and it's even more

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.049 
building anyway and it's even more
impossible<00:00:57.589> to<00:00:57.830> think<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.250> building<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.760> with

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
impossible to think of building it with

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.469 
impossible to think of building it with
playing<00:00:59.870> cards<00:01:00.019> and<00:01:00.760> also<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.790> always<00:01:02.119> think

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
playing cards and also I always think

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.630 
playing cards and also I always think
it's<00:01:02.659> important<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.500> build<00:01:03.710> something<00:01:04.129> that

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
it's important to build something that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.800 
it's important to build something that
people<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:06.229> identify<00:01:06.680> with<00:01:07.549> as<00:01:08.150> part<00:01:08.600> of

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
people can identify with as part of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.750 
people can identify with as part of
their<00:01:09.250> their<00:01:10.250> city<00:01:10.610> or<00:01:10.820> their<00:01:11.000> culture

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.860 

well<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.790> always<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> an

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
well I always like to have an

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.480 
well I always like to have an
opportunity<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.280> building

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
opportunity to see when I'm building

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.300 
opportunity to see when I'm building
this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> no<00:01:21.750> substitute<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.710> seeing<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.130> real

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this is no substitute or seeing the real

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.960 
this is no substitute or seeing the real
thing<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.910> for<00:01:24.690> me<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.050> been<00:01:25.370> really<00:01:26.370> cool<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
thing so for me it's been really cool to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.590 
thing so for me it's been really cool to
see<00:01:27.890> exactly<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.520> doing<00:01:29.550> and<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.420> I'm

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
see exactly what I'm doing and what I'm

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.590 
see exactly what I'm doing and what I'm
doing<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:31.830> doing<00:01:32.160> wrong

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.390 

so<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:41.050> really<00:01:41.260> just<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.680> matter<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:42.070> like

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
so it's really just a matter of like

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.770 
so it's really just a matter of like
patience<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:45.210> perseverance<00:01:46.210> like<00:01:46.660> you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
patience and perseverance like you

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.230 
patience and perseverance like you
really<00:01:46.930> have<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.470> focus<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.370> takes<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.060> long

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
really have to focus and takes a long

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.560 
really have to focus and takes a long
time<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.810> do<00:01:49.930> something<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.610> can't<00:01:51.910> think

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
time to do something so you can't think

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.880 
time to do something so you can't think
that<00:01:52.690> you're<00:01:52.900> gonna<00:01:53.080> be<00:01:53.290> done<00:01:53.470> with<00:01:53.500> it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
that you're gonna be done with it

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.930 
that you're gonna be done with it
anytime<00:01:54.520> soon<00:01:55.170> playing<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.380> card<00:01:56.620> game<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:57.220> an

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
anytime soon playing a card game is an

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.890 
anytime soon playing a card game is an
equally<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.950> wholesome<00:02:00.900> activity

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
equally kind of wholesome activity

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.560 
equally kind of wholesome activity
because<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:03.040> involves<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.030> family

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
because it involves like a family

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.050 
because it involves like a family
sitting<00:02:04.930> around<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.440> table<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.100> playing<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
sitting around a table and playing a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.530 
sitting around a table and playing a
game<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.720> kids<00:02:08.350> learn<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:09.000> count<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.270> know

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
game and kids learn to count and know

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.240 
game and kids learn to count and know
their<00:02:10.780> numbers<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.440> they<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.130> they

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
their numbers and they you know they

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.620 
their numbers and they you know they
actually<00:02:12.340> have<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.700> think<00:02:12.940> about<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> strategy

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
actually have to think about a strategy

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
actually have to think about a strategy
and<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:15.490> kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:16.260> an<00:02:17.260> activity

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and so it's kind of like an activity

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.860 
and so it's kind of like an activity
that<00:02:18.040> brings<00:02:18.220> people<00:02:18.820> together<00:02:19.150> rather<00:02:19.480> it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
that brings people together rather it's

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.350 
that brings people together rather it's
a<00:02:19.930> family<00:02:20.440> or<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> group<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:21.010> friends<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.330> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
a family or a group of friends so I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.770 
a family or a group of friends so I
think<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> idea<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.650> having<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.130> national

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
think that the idea of having a national

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.020 
think that the idea of having a national
playing<00:02:25.780> card<00:02:26.170> day<00:02:26.410> it's<00:02:27.100> kind<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.550> great

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
playing card day it's kind of a great

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.229 
playing card day it's kind of a great
opportunity<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.660> people<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.200> think<00:02:29.320> about

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
opportunity for people to think about

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.150 
opportunity for people to think about
simpler<00:02:31.239> times<00:02:31.770> simpler<00:02:32.770> activities<00:02:33.690> family

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
simpler times simpler activities family
