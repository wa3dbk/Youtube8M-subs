00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.640
 about its specifications and to test the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 performance it counts with two

 the lines of the apparatus are more straight 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.570
 but the saints remained rounded in the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.719
 detail that is already quite characteristic 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.479
