hey everyone so as you probably know
from<00:00:01.949> last<00:00:02.370> week<00:00:02.580> it<00:00:02.760> is<00:00:02.879> time<00:00:03.210> for<00:00:03.480> your

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
from last week it is time for your

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.889 
from last week it is time for your
questions<00:00:04.170> with<00:00:04.710> you<00:00:04.890> so<00:00:05.339> let's<00:00:05.670> begin<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.600> I

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
questions with you so let's begin so I

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.720 
questions with you so let's begin so I
have<00:00:07.410> two<00:00:07.589> questions<00:00:07.799> from<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.340> same<00:00:08.519> person

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
have two questions from the same person

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.839 
have two questions from the same person
they<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.090> toffee<00:00:09.719> 16<00:00:10.380> 17<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.580> first

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
they are toffee 16 17 and the first

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.430 
they are toffee 16 17 and the first
question<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.420> who<00:00:12.780> would<00:00:12.990> win<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.410> fight

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
question is who would win in a fight

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.880 
question is who would win in a fight
mega<00:00:14.309> linea<00:00:14.759> versus<00:00:15.210> titanoboa<00:00:15.809> well<00:00:16.560> these

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
mega linea versus titanoboa well these

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.529 
mega linea versus titanoboa well these
two<00:00:17.130> animals<00:00:17.310> did<00:00:17.730> not<00:00:17.910> live<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.359> same

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
two animals did not live in the same

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.080 
two animals did not live in the same
place<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> same<00:00:19.800> time<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:20.640> never<00:00:20.850> met

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
place at the same time so they never met

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
place at the same time so they never met
each<00:00:21.240> other<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:21.960> did<00:00:22.609> well<00:00:23.609> Meg

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
each other but if they did well Meg

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.970 
each other but if they did well Meg
alania<00:00:24.269> lived<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.960> Australia<00:00:25.230> during<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
alania lived in Australia during the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
alania lived in Australia during the
Pleistocene<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.269> estimates<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:27.930> its<00:00:28.050> size

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
Pleistocene the estimates for its size

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
Pleistocene the estimates for its size
would<00:00:28.560> appear<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.369> could<00:00:29.730> grow<00:00:29.939> up<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
would appear that this could grow up to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
would appear that this could grow up to
3<00:00:31.080> meters<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.650> maybe<00:00:31.830> seven<00:00:32.309> meters<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
3 meters to maybe seven meters in that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.060 
3 meters to maybe seven meters in that
which<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.480> large<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> relative<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
which is pretty large it's a relative of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.250 
which is pretty large it's a relative of
the<00:00:35.100> Komodo<00:00:35.610> dragons<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.600> something<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the Komodo dragons so it's something you

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
the Komodo dragons so it's something you
wouldn't<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> me<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> learn<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
wouldn't want to me to learn and the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
wouldn't want to me to learn and the
chances<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.010> living<00:00:41.340> relatives

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
chances are like it's living relatives

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660 
chances are like it's living relatives
today<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.840> venom<00:00:43.350> glands<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.950> its<00:00:44.399> mouth

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
today it had venom glands in its mouth

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.049 
today it had venom glands in its mouth
and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.989> titanoboa<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.610> lived

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and then we have titanoboa which lived

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
and then we have titanoboa which lived
at<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> paleocene<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.530> 60<00:00:49.950> million<00:00:50.129> years

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
at the paleocene about 60 million years

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.240 
at the paleocene about 60 million years
ago<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.110> massive<00:00:52.469> snake<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
ago this is one massive snake the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.580 
ago this is one massive snake the
estimate<00:00:53.760> seem<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.750> snake<00:00:55.110> could<00:00:55.140> grow

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
estimate seem that this snake could grow

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
estimate seem that this snake could grow
up<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.039> 50<00:00:56.640> feet<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.210> length<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
up to 50 feet in length and that is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.560 
up to 50 feet in length and that is
massive<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.879> would<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.149> been<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.270> lot

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
massive so this would have been a lot

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.950 
massive so this would have been a lot
bigger<00:01:01.020> than<00:01:01.469> mega<00:01:01.770> lainnya<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:03.059> opinion<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
bigger than mega lainnya in my opinion I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
bigger than mega lainnya in my opinion I
think<00:01:04.229> titanoboa<00:01:05.189> would<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.790> won<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
think titanoboa would have won in a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
think titanoboa would have won in a
fight<00:01:06.360> at<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:06.900> animals<00:01:07.049> met<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
fight at these two animals met the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
fight at these two animals met the
reason<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:08.869> titanoboa

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
reason for that is because titanoboa

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
reason for that is because titanoboa
would<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.220> powerful<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
would have been so powerful when it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.679 
would have been so powerful when it
constricted<00:01:13.710> its<00:01:13.920> prey<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.390> think

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
constricted its prey that I don't think

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
constricted its prey that I don't think
Meg<00:01:15.930> alania<00:01:16.409> would<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> chance<00:01:17.340> from

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
Meg alania would have had a chance from

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
Meg alania would have had a chance from
the<00:01:18.450> fossil<00:01:18.630> evidence<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.350> being<00:01:19.530> van<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the fossil evidence that's being van it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
the fossil evidence that's being van it
would<00:01:20.070> appear<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.460> titanoboa<00:01:21.150> lived<00:01:21.630> with

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
would appear that titanoboa lived with

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.530 
would appear that titanoboa lived with
animals<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.950> crocodiles<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> turtles<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
animals like crocodiles and turtles and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.109 
animals like crocodiles and turtles and
these<00:01:25.020> weren't<00:01:25.380> small<00:01:25.860> animals<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> fossils

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
these weren't small animals the fossils

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
these weren't small animals the fossils
have<00:01:27.330> been<00:01:27.360> found<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.350> large<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have been found to be very large of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.640 
have been found to be very large of
these<00:01:29.520> turtles<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> crocodiles<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
these turtles and crocodiles and the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.499 
these turtles and crocodiles and the
crocodiles<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.430> lived<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.030> titanoboa

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
crocodiles that lived with titanoboa

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
crocodiles that lived with titanoboa
would<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lot<00:01:34.650> larger<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.130> mega

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
would have been a lot larger than mega

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
would have been a lot larger than mega
lainnya<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.600> would<00:01:36.750> seem<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.409> titanoboa

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
lainnya and it would seem that titanoboa

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.850 
lainnya and it would seem that titanoboa
fed<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.420> those<00:01:39.659> crocodiles<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fed on those crocodiles so because of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.359 
fed on those crocodiles so because of
that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.329> believe<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.680> animals<00:01:44.189> did

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that I believe that if these animals did

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
that I believe that if these animals did
get<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.700> fight<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.210> would<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.659> titanoboa

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
get in a fight it would be titanoboa

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.889 
get in a fight it would be titanoboa
that<00:01:46.890> would<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.399> winner<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> I've<00:01:48.600> heard

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that would be the winner and I've heard

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
that would be the winner and I've heard
estimates<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.829> constriction<00:01:50.670> pressure

estimates that the constriction pressure
of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> snake<00:01:52.290> would<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.829> been<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
of the snake would have been the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.850 
of the snake would have been the

sure<00:01:58.079> how<00:01:58.439> accurate<00:01:58.729> those<00:01:59.729> estimates<00:02:00.270> are

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
sure how accurate those estimates are

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.289 
sure how accurate those estimates are
but<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.590> true<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.549> would<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:03.000> want<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
but if that's true you would not want to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
but if that's true you would not want to
be<00:02:03.360> constricted<00:02:04.170> by<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.829> mass

next<00:02:09.450> question<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.129> know<00:02:11.160> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
next question then is do you know what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.930 
next question then is do you know what
so<00:02:11.940> offer<00:02:12.300> versus<00:02:12.930> last<00:02:13.290> name<00:02:13.800> was<00:02:14.129> like<00:02:14.670> half

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so offer versus last name was like half

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.630 
so offer versus last name was like half

the species name and the first name is
the<00:02:19.620> genus<00:02:20.069> name<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.239> didn't<00:02:21.599> know<00:02:21.780> what

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
the genus name now I didn't know what

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.680 
the genus name now I didn't know what

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the species name of this giant flares it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
the species name of this giant flares it
is<00:02:25.200> massive<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> would<00:02:26.099> appear<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
is massive it would appear that the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.339 
is massive it would appear that the
fossil<00:02:26.790> evidence<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.510> has<00:02:27.599> been<00:02:27.629> found<00:02:28.110> of

display which show that this could grow

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.100 
display which show that this could grow
up<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.290> about<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.370> inch<00:02:32.610> long<00:02:32.849> which<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.720> very

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
up to about an inch long which is a very

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.259 
up to about an inch long which is a very
largely<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> something<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.090> not

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
largely it is something you would not

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.240 
largely it is something you would not
want<00:02:36.330> fighting<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.349> believe<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> scene

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
want fighting you I believe of the scene

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.610 
want fighting you I believe of the scene
in<00:02:38.430> walking<00:02:38.849> with<00:02:39.000> dinosaurs<00:02:39.049> but<00:02:40.049> identity

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
in walking with dinosaurs but identity

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.949 
in walking with dinosaurs but identity
it<00:02:40.709> was<00:02:40.829> given<00:02:41.190> its<00:02:41.519> actual<00:02:42.150> name<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.690> it

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
it was given its actual name I think it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.289 
it was given its actual name I think it
was<00:02:43.049> just<00:02:43.110> referred<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.799> as<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.610> parasite

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
was just referred to as the parasite

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.020 
was just referred to as the parasite
when<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.349> was<00:02:46.440> feeding<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.310> honor<00:02:47.610> papyrus

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
when it was feeding on the honor papyrus

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.729 
when it was feeding on the honor papyrus
which<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.720> pterosaur<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.410> was<00:02:49.530> featured

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
which is the pterosaur that was featured

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.190 
which is the pterosaur that was featured
in<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.190> series<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.760> actually<00:02:51.239> had<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.900> some

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
in the series I actually had to do some

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.800 
in the series I actually had to do some
searching<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:53.400> find<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.090> name<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
searching to find out the name for the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.539 
searching to find out the name for the
species<00:02:55.079> I've<00:02:55.530> been<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.829> reason<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.310> is

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
species I've been the reason for that is

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.069 
species I've been the reason for that is
because<00:02:56.579> there's<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> great<00:02:57.750> deal<00:02:57.840> of

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
because there's not a great deal of

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.350 
because there's not a great deal of
research<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:59.129> in<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.730> display<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
research going on in to display at the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.119 
research going on in to display at the
moment<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.500> being<00:03:01.680> kept

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
moment and so it's just being kept

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.660 
moment and so it's just being kept
stored<00:03:03.030> safely<00:03:03.569> in<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.319> museum<00:03:04.530> somewhere<00:03:05.069> but

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
stored safely in a museum somewhere but

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.729 
stored safely in a museum somewhere but
i<00:03:05.910> was<00:03:06.299> able<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.750> find<00:03:06.959> out<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.470> species

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
i was able to find out that this species

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.699 
i was able to find out that this species
name<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.549> long<00:03:09.060> types<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.959> next<00:03:10.290> question

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
name is long types the next question

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.830 
name is long types the next question
comes<00:03:10.739> from<00:03:11.040> goose<00:03:11.430> trees<00:03:11.700> guests<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.450> it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
comes from goose trees guests and it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080 
comes from goose trees guests and it
actually<00:03:13.109> refers<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.130> i<00:03:14.160> actually<00:03:14.730> made<00:03:14.910> this

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
actually refers to i actually made this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.259 
actually refers to i actually made this
video<00:03:15.859> about<00:03:16.859> voice<00:03:17.220> acting<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.000> didn't

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
video about voice acting and it didn't

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.449 
video about voice acting and it didn't
go<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.450> well<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.170> decided<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.799> get<00:03:19.980> rid<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.250> it

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
go so well so i decided to get rid of it

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.599 
go so well so i decided to get rid of it
but<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.840> they<00:03:22.019> say<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:23.069> know<00:03:23.220> what<00:03:23.430> you

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
but that they say you know what you

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.520 
but that they say you know what you
should<00:03:23.639> have<00:03:23.880> done<00:03:24.000> Ryan<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.810> maybe<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.380> is

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
should have done Ryan and maybe this is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.770 
should have done Ryan and maybe this is
a<00:03:25.560> possibility<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.549> future<00:03:26.639> video<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
a possibility for a future video you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.629 
a possibility for a future video you
should<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.079> used<00:03:28.319> your<00:03:28.530> vocal<00:03:29.040> talents<00:03:29.459> to

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
should have used your vocal talents to

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.300 
should have used your vocal talents to
make<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.849> video<00:03:30.150> where<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.049> are<00:03:31.230> tempted<00:03:31.769> to

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
make a video where you are tempted to

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.789 
make a video where you are tempted to
best<00:03:32.670> approximate<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:33.900> different<00:03:34.349> types<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
best approximate what different types of

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.979 
best approximate what different types of
dinosaurs<00:03:35.069> sounded<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:36.090> based<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.870> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
dinosaurs sounded like based on the

ha<00:03:50.150> well<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.919> try<00:03:53.190> different<00:03:53.250> things

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
ha well I like to try different things

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.360 
ha well I like to try different things
out<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.299> youtube<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.139> unfortunately<00:03:56.069> that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
out on youtube and unfortunately that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.039 
out on youtube and unfortunately that
was<00:03:56.549> something<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.000> did<00:03:57.329> not<00:03:57.359> work<00:03:57.540> out

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
was something that did not work out

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.849 
was something that did not work out
particularly<00:03:58.650> well<00:03:59.130> but<00:04:00.410> referring<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.650> your

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
particularly well but referring to your

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.890 
particularly well but referring to your
question<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.579> don't<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:03.389> I'm<00:04:03.510> going<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.720> make

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
question I don't think I'm going to make

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.890 
question I don't think I'm going to make
a<00:04:03.930> video<00:04:04.169> where<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> make<00:04:05.430> dinosaur<00:04:06.239> sounds<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
a video where I make dinosaur sounds and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.210 
a video where I make dinosaur sounds and
that<00:04:08.090> probably<00:04:09.090> goes<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> bit<00:04:10.230> too<00:04:10.500> far<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:10.829> me

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that probably goes a bit too far for me

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.330 
that probably goes a bit too far for me
so<00:04:11.489> I'm<00:04:11.970> not<00:04:12.269> gonna<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:14.069> know<00:04:14.099> on

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
so I'm not gonna do that but you know on

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.619 
so I'm not gonna do that but you know on
youtube<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.909> do<00:04:14.969> want<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.360> try<00:04:15.569> different

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
youtube I do want to try different

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.860 
youtube I do want to try different
things<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.320> have<00:04:16.620> to

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
things that I have to

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.539 
things that I have to
for<00:04:16.989> ideas<00:04:17.500> not<00:04:17.739> all<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.160> them<00:04:18.250> are<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.519> same

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
for ideas not all of them are the same

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.969 
for ideas not all of them are the same
so<00:04:19.239> sometimes<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.780> try<00:04:19.989> them<00:04:20.109> out<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.380> you

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
so sometimes I try them out and you

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.040 
so sometimes I try them out and you
won't<00:04:21.220> know<00:04:21.489> if<00:04:21.820> they<00:04:22.000> work<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.479> well<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:22.930> you

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
won't know if they work out well if you

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.290 
won't know if they work out well if you
don't<00:04:23.229> try<00:04:23.470> them<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.040> sometimes<00:04:24.910> you<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.270> have

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
don't try them so sometimes you do have

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.010 
don't try them so sometimes you do have
to<00:04:25.630> make<00:04:25.960> risks<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:26.949> take<00:04:27.790> risks<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.540> find<00:04:28.810> out

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
to make risks and take risks to find out

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.980 
to make risks and take risks to find out
what<00:04:29.650> is<00:04:29.919> good<00:04:30.850> for<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.419> do<00:04:31.570> when<00:04:31.870> you're

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
what is good for you to do when you're

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.379 
what is good for you to do when you're
making<00:04:32.050> videos<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.130> sometimes<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.180> works

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
making videos so sometimes it works

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.860 
making videos so sometimes it works
sometimes<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.990> doesn't<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.850> we'll<00:04:36.850> see<00:04:37.120> in

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
sometimes it doesn't and we'll see in

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.460 
sometimes it doesn't and we'll see in
the<00:04:38.139> future<00:04:38.320> what<00:04:38.770> else<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.520> make<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.690> know

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the future what else I make that I know

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.189 
the future what else I make that I know
that<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.520> kind<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.180> stuff<00:04:43.540> isn't<00:04:44.169> really

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
that that kind of stuff isn't really

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.750 
that that kind of stuff isn't really
good<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.620> my<00:04:44.860> youtube<00:04:45.280> channel<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.639> i

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
good for my youtube channel so i

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.290 
good for my youtube channel so i

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
have referred to that would also have

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.270 
have referred to that would also have
been<00:05:34.240> over<00:05:34.990> animals<00:05:35.530> that<00:05:35.800> would<00:05:35.950> have<00:05:36.070> lived

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
been over animals that would have lived

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.070 
been over animals that would have lived
there<00:05:36.400> there<00:05:36.700> would<00:05:36.849> have<00:05:36.940> been<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.300> lot<00:05:37.840> of

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
there there would have been a lot of

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.409 
there there would have been a lot of
morality<00:05:38.500> in<00:05:39.010> arthropods<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:40.120> would<00:05:40.270> have

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
morality in arthropods that would have

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.710 
morality in arthropods that would have
been<00:05:40.539> trial<00:05:40.900> abides<00:05:41.260> sea<00:05:42.099> scorpions<00:05:42.849> maybe

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
been trial abides sea scorpions maybe

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.480 
been trial abides sea scorpions maybe
look<00:05:43.960> into<00:05:44.110> them<00:05:44.470> food<00:05:44.800> if<00:05:45.070> you're<00:05:45.220> looking

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
look into them food if you're looking

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.120 
look into them food if you're looking
into<00:05:45.639> fish<00:05:46.060> really<00:05:47.050> I<00:05:47.080> think<00:05:47.199> the<00:05:47.470> Sharks<00:05:47.919> of<00:05:48.070> a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
into fish really I think the Sharks of a

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.680 
into fish really I think the Sharks of a
good<00:05:48.340> animal<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.910> look<00:05:49.120> at<00:05:49.330> so<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:49.539> think

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
good animal to look at so I think

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.659 
good animal to look at so I think
talking<00:05:50.080> about<00:05:50.590> sharks<00:05:51.160> would<00:05:51.310> be<00:05:51.490> really

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
talking about sharks would be really

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:52.830 
talking about sharks would be really
good<00:05:52.030> because<00:05:52.060> there<00:05:52.510> would<00:05:52.630> have<00:05:52.690> been<00:05:52.750> a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
good because there would have been a

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.439 
good because there would have been a
rarity<00:05:53.260> joining<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.070> devonian<00:05:54.699> period<00:05:54.729> and

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
rarity joining the devonian period and

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.240 
rarity joining the devonian period and
I've<00:05:56.169> been<00:05:56.260> charged<00:05:56.590> some<00:05:56.770> a<00:05:56.860> really<00:05:57.099> good

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
I've been charged some a really good

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.250 
I've been charged some a really good
animal<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.729> talk<00:05:57.940> but<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.330> mean<00:05:58.630> many<00:05:58.810> people

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
animal to talk but I mean many people

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.219 
animal to talk but I mean many people
are<00:05:59.349> interested<00:05:59.530> in<00:06:00.099> them<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.520> so<00:06:01.389> I<00:06:01.630> think<00:06:01.690> if

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
are interested in them and so I think if

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.540 
are interested in them and so I think if
you<00:06:02.320> talk<00:06:02.470> about<00:06:02.530> sharks<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.280> what<00:06:03.430> they

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
you talk about sharks and what they

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.770 
you talk about sharks and what they
would<00:06:03.699> have<00:06:03.729> been<00:06:03.849> like<00:06:04.000> in<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.210> devonian

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
would have been like in the devonian

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.480 
would have been like in the devonian
possibly<00:06:05.349> that<00:06:05.530> would<00:06:05.560> be<00:06:05.919> something<00:06:06.130> good

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
possibly that would be something good

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.310 
possibly that would be something good
for<00:06:06.729> your<00:06:06.820> book<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.180> I<00:06:07.479> hope<00:06:07.750> it<00:06:07.900> goes<00:06:08.050> really
