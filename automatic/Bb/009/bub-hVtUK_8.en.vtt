little bits actually sort of tend to

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
little bits actually sort of tend to
caramelize<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> crunch<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.030> as

you cook it and the skin you always pick
maracle<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> skin<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.700> holds<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.450> together

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
maracle to the skin on holds it together

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
maracle to the skin on holds it together
and<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> skin<00:01:40.170> crisps<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.680> nicely<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> we'll

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and the skin crisps up nicely so we'll

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.850 
and the skin crisps up nicely so we'll
go<00:01:42.600> ahead<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.930> fly<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.470> side<00:01:43.710> as

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
go ahead and fly up the other side as

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
go ahead and fly up the other side as
well<00:01:44.009> using<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:44.880> technique<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.509> cut

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
well using the same technique just cut

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.859 
well using the same technique just cut
make<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.829> small<00:01:47.220> incision<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:48.360> below<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
make one small incision right below the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.410

and press straight down now you see I'm

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.970 
and press straight down now you see I'm
putting<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.990> little<00:02:00.170> bit<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.470> pressure<00:02:00.650> on<00:02:00.830> the

putting a little bit of pressure on the
on<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.520> fish<00:02:01.730> just<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.120> keep<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.480> place<00:02:02.690> so

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
on the fish just to keep it in place so

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.719 
on the fish just to keep it in place so
that<00:02:02.930> when<00:02:03.110> you're<00:02:03.260> pushing<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.370> whole<00:02:04.520> thing

left on there as well

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.920 
left on there as well
you<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.280> trim<00:02:25.459> up<00:02:27.760> now<00:02:28.760> mackerels<00:02:29.270> bones<00:02:29.600> are

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
you just trim up now mackerels bones are

very easy to deal with there's just

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.640 
very easy to deal with there's just
about<00:02:32.510> ten<00:02:32.810> bones<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.260> they<00:02:33.320> run<00:02:33.470> straight

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
about ten bones and they run straight

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.470 
about ten bones and they run straight
down<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.100> middle<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> fly<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.209> what<00:02:35.390> we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
down the middle of the fly and what we

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.110 
down the middle of the fly and what we
use<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.959> called<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.620> V<00:02:36.860> cut<00:02:37.130> technique<00:02:37.670> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
use is a called a V cut technique and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.630 
use is a called a V cut technique and
you<00:02:38.630> just<00:02:38.840> make<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> small<00:02:40.070> incision<00:02:40.220> right

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
you just make a small incision right

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.979 
you just make a small incision right
down<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.060> skin<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:41.510> not<00:02:41.630> all<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> way

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
down to the skin but not all the way

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.040 
down to the skin but not all the way
through<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.440> either<00:02:42.739> side<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.280> bones<00:02:43.459> and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
through on either side of the bones and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.940 
through on either side of the bones and
just<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.110> make<00:02:45.230> sure<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.560> get<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.830> all<00:02:45.920> out

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
just to make sure you get them all out

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.220 
just to make sure you get them all out
you've<00:02:46.310> cut<00:02:46.459> about<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> half<00:02:47.000> inch<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.570> now

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
you've cut about a half inch or so now

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.500 
you've cut about a half inch or so now
once<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.650> under<00:02:48.770> them<00:02:49.300> just<00:02:50.300> cut<00:02:50.480> right

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
once you get under them just cut right

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.510 
once you get under them just cut right
under<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.110> then<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.860> pull<00:02:52.040> all<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> bones

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
under and then you pull all the bones

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.060 
under and then you pull all the bones
right<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.270> well<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:54.590> they<00:02:54.739> all<00:02:54.890> are

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
right out well there they all are

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.620 
right out well there they all are
so<00:02:55.640> now<00:02:55.760> you're<00:02:55.910> left<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> completely

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
so now you're left with a completely

skin still intact on this side now one

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.470 
skin still intact on this side now one
of<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.310> reasons<00:03:04.549> why<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> love<00:03:04.910> mackerel<00:03:05.360> so

of the reasons why I love mackerel so

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.910 
of the reasons why I love mackerel so
much<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:06.049> very<00:03:06.170> sustainable<00:03:06.650> catch

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
much is it's a very sustainable catch
