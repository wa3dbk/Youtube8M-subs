00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone so even if 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.840
 today to share with you what 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.870
 what will be my new storage for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.360
 scrap papers 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 in fact I have no script room I 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 Just because I have quite a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.630
 desk a few shelves in a closet 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 and plastic drawer towers in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.000
 my children's playroom 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 so I squat a bit so I have to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 optimize to the maximum the place do not have 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 right now but my papers are 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.460
 stowed in two drawers from my shelves 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.899
 plastic but good every time 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.550
 I come paper is not practical must 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 everything I go out to find the right one 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 angle and a super a time a time 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 crazy so I decided to put away my 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.600
 papers in crates with 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 infill 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.210
 so there will be one for the papers 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 united and for printed papers the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 collections so I asked my 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.680
 little brother to make me me so 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.270
 two crates he did that like a chef 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 are really super rebel 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 they are super well finished thank you very much 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:22.799
 nico so I added to the bottom I 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 put Teflon small glides 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.330
 that she can easily slip on 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.640
 my work plan because when 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.750
 they will be full of my life I 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.439
 would be happy to be able to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.040
 close it's easy so its crates 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:45.509
 in interior dimensions they make 33 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:48.900
 side cm by 36 cm deep so 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.940
 at the base I had thought of doing 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.800
 and the cardboard dividers that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.530
 I would have discovered with papers 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.360
 scrap and I thought to put away my papers 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.320
 by color and by conviction in this 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.230
 kind of two that that of 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.790
 freezing the wind that enchants me is 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.310
 not so much because the bigger ones 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.610
 that I found these advertising skills 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 seized plock the big ones they are blue 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.490
 so that's really very, very 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.190
 happy 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:25.050
 and by chance I discovered in a 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.300
 magazine 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.100
 she lives great in a magazine 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.860
 everyone needs to know who's mind 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.050
 scrapbooking is the one of the month 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.710
 from october november 2014 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.490
 at the end of last year in this magazine 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.000
 there is a heading storage tips 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.170
 I'm going to find it again 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.770
 so there was an article on the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.680
 Basque Rap Prom is good to see I know 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.800
 not if I love them well 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.830
 marie-france gransart is here she has 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.340
 great storage tips and between 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.490
 between so it's past she's bothering in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.400
 Landes protection pouch for 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.800
 33 rpm vinyl records 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.750
 it is pile hair the size of the papers 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.410
 and I found this tip moment 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.390
 awesome 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.700
 so I looked on the internet sites 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.970
 who sell this kind of article is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.420
 so 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.580
 I chose the site called 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.260
 disc planet 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.790
 so I placed the chosen order is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.990
 full of reference points so to 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.880
 plenty of things so there are the 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.640
 protections for the ten that the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 paper pouches for discs ago 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.020
 tabs of boxes of 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.450
 storage really needed everything for the 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:57.370
 collectors and so I have 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:59.980
 ordered it is protective pouch 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.840
 so here this one is different 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.690
 thickness 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.600
 this one is 150 microns and they 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.290
 are really great and weis and pile hair 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.490
 at the right size 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:18.060
 I'll show you that fucks on it 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.060
 this is a vision of europe 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.360
 so here and find some more 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.710
 others you can put a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.090
 entire collection I think without 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.390
 problem his sales and then I'll have 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.390
 more than abroad in crates 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.610
 So that's it already I was great 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.280
 content and in addition by digging into the 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.300
 site 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.510
 I found expectations and look all 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.890
 made 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.380
 so these are buyer taxes in 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.100
 plastic that are great and peace are 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.330

 little flat that there is not really 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.669
 but it's not the break what delivers 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.050
 it's a carrier and it gives the collar 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.270
 is only against signature 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.830
