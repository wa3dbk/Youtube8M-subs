00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.769
 tolerated so 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.590
 and 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.259
 then discuss 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 half current 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.539
 until the whole live and Rainer Fromm 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.909
 Frankfurt 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.249
 that could be so Untermain 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 plays to the opening 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.240
 under which 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.460
 until the 30 it is stupid 90 +2 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.900
 the first winners 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.380
 can be so noticeable 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.810
 I am, however, find 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 November on the ground 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 KÃ¼per 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.850
 then you go against it 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 index finger 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 in the second arch 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 the torture 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.100
 move 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.910
 after the final second covenant on the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.040
 Antonio Latella and 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 The ring finger in the third fret needs the track today 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.030
 confused my opponent 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.610
 Timofte Euro Bremen with threes 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.009
 Rooney wants 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.630
 in the third fret 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 because and deep conviction 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.539
 at the moment and 2 connected now 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.100
 his fingers 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.790
 and places 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.229
 probably the right page in the third button Ringfinger 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.219
 have to kiss 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.509
 and yet Mats Wappmann changes 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.499
 Kiel ddp-nrd 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.329

 d 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.839
 the 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 and then again

 Brown also pressed 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.409
 drink the fool 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.899
 in the second fret 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 so the

 Frans wanted to keep pushing the Conservation and Hamas 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.809

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.349
 the 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.109
