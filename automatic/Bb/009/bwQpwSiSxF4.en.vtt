 hello everyone would talk to them 15 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.200
 Welcome to my new tutorial that explains how to extract the iso of 1 mb and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 pass it to the memory of your psp so you can play it from your memory 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.959
 what you need is 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.820
 a psp with custom firmware 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.880
 a game in wii puts a pc 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.400
 that's it 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.989
 let's start 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.199
 step 1 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.159
 we turn off the psp completely 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.989
 we leave the power button a few seconds until it goes off and the 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.449
 turn on with the r button pressed to enter the recovery mode 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.240
 we go to the option configuration / o md mode and we put it in sony mp 9660 not in 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.920
 l 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.610
 then we go to the xmb option because it looks device and we put it in wii media disc 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.230
 we give him 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010
 we give you success 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.620
 we put the gurÃ­ see me our psp connect the psp with the cable that is 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.040
 should 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.190
 we will automatically be watching the made of our game instead of the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 memory 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.370
 we copy it in the ipc 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.490
 6 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.020
 we enter the recovery mode again and we put the option back 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.299
 configuration / xmb you say to memories trick 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.540
 we give him barak 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.300
 we give you exit 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.900
 we go to wi connection is seen and we paste the and that we have on the pc in the folder 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.610
 iso root strick memory 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 Yes now 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850
 we already have the game of good air in our memory 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.710
 I suggest you compress in the isu do that or explain in one of 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.840
