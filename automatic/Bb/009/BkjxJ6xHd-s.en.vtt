00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
parts look pretty similar so it kind of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
parts look pretty similar so it kind of
confuses<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.250> you'll<00:01:29.820> get<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.090> one

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
confuses you but you'll get that one

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
confuses you but you'll get that one

part and you'll be able to have the coin

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
part and you'll be able to have the coin
as<00:01:32.040> well<00:01:32.450> there's<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.720> third<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.619> that's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
as well there's the third I think that's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.530

the<00:01:34.890> third<00:01:35.400> coin<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.090> sure<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the third coin I'm not sure that's the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
the third coin I'm not sure that's the
first<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.700> no<00:01:38.880> idea

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
first or not but actually have no idea

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
do that because in platformers I don't

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I progress through time in a very

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.350 
I progress through time in a very
fruitful<00:01:49.229> manner<00:01:49.560> i'm<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.280> spartan<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
fruitful manner i'm up spartan from the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530 
fruitful manner i'm up spartan from the
year<00:01:51.600> 300<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:53.399> seven<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.000> something<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
year 300 and like seven or something I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
year 300 and like seven or something I
