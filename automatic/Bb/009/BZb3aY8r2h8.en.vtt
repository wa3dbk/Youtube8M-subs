 surprised are the baby zombies ok this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.410
 that's going to be pretty enough 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.930
 funny that they add the ones 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.120
 zombies babies in the microcredit you're going 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.100
 zombies now you can own what you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.410

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.110
 there are also the death messages that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.760
 When you die, they seem like a message to you 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.310
 example if you die drowned is going to 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.170
 appear the message and this is going to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.550
 be right the truth this but all this 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.840
