00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.619
 there are two years of work already 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.510
 behind this festival a lot of 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.460
 do a lot of energy a lot of 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.830
 world about 150 people 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.260
 are working the last few weeks on 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.460
 this event is enormously in the game 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.290
 for audiences since we 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.630
 we have an average of 39 spectators 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.940
 a lot of emotion we will remember that the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.320
 festival is open each year to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.790
 graphic arts so the choice was 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.920
 heritage this year the first 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.530
 duval exposure n these are 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.720
 engravings that date from the 19th of the originals 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.909
 with a lot of small humor 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.739
 tips like that a little bit critical 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.019
 on the general society in particular 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.370
 and this exhibition is very 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.400
 different again it's a 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.830
 cartoonist so works that 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.409
 recuts from the period of the 50s 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.229
 practically until the end so of 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.809
 80's 90's and so these are 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.360
 portraits of dancer artists 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.010
 singer with this little touch very 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.970
 particular of the caricaturist in 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.610
 third part 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.470
 it's a complete novelty we have 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.960
 chosen this year to involve 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.030
 father's classes right so 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.400
 spaces actually the most 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.460
 city ​​of mont-de-marsan and 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.190
 around a creative creation project 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.050
 posters and almost without our knowledge he 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.320
 is a link finally between these posters 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.300
 and the work of the seals there can be 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.770
 to be a link I would say indirect and 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.250
 unconscious that happened between these 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 two exhibitions 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.130
 we can talk about utopia realize 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590
 actually from the passage to the dream and the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 reality to give a dream to the public 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.950
 actually with shows 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 unpublished creations that are born 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 paths of imagination that have 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.370
 concretized with a job precisely 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.500
 on the form on the bottom on a state 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.930
 mind also for this 25th 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.300
 birthday so creative and of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.970
 freedom of expression and the festival arte 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.670
 Flamenco and committed precisely 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.410
 to artists to offer them this 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.900
 this creative space and this scene 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.459
 to express oneself 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.670
 strong times actually with 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.040
 especially the dialogue of the two pianos 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.840
 gilding and it's diego amador and well 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.400
 obviously also always mind 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 festive because that's very important 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 also we are 25 back so serves 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.540
 who says 25th birthday says do and 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.580
 we really have real will to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.340
 share and celebrate with the public 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.500
 and so we have an idea so of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.209
 do a giant karaoke so that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.320
 all audiences Saturday night after 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.750
 all the shows that will be given 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.280
 in the city cafe cantante bodegas 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050
 can find themselves in charles place 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.870
 Gaulle for a giant karaoke 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.530
 after the retrospective photos of 25 years 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.600
 and it's really about sharing and 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.290
 dance sing on malian slab tn 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.290
 for two permanent 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.890
 and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.800
 there was one thing that was turning in 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.870
 my head what is it happening 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.330
 in those moments that we live is this 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.740
 to do is the economic crisis 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.070
 what is it 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.530
 do it because it's true and that everything 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.990
 the world we think there is some 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.070
 thing that does not eat but it's not 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.950
 only the economy 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:44.270
 it's sweet that it comes then the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.810
 reflection was that there is a crisis 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.200
 of the summer I believe the key 6 and value 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:56.750
 and I believe they have to give more 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.860
 important that we have created the need 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.860
 to have 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.560
 I have not only now talk about a 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.419
 tobias is necessary because as I 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:22.139
 play that there the word utopia to each and that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.860
 hard good at worst for me it's in 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.680
 someone is we should not 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.960
 to pass if I can not arrive you can 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.020
 not us it's thing that there are people 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.850
 there we if things do not work there 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.789
 there are the commands and the utopian spirit 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.030
 of someone because otherwise can not 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.490
 survive if things do not work well 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.620
 always a dana link to us this is 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.310
 the utopian spirit that there is in the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.099
 genetics course it's tomorrow we will 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.260
 and then we have to talk about saints but 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.270
 you have to be not just talk 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.759
 in the romantic aspect 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.930
 you have to be very practical and practical 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.820
 and be quite so critical with us 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.130
 what is happening it is necessary to analyze 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.599
 why it has to be very 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.050
 critical you have to analyze 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:19.650
 what are they going through and then I 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.610
 believe that a mole ia is the essence of 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.909
 copies to seyssins cdd highlight 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:30.780
 the Roman value m packs and the spirit 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:33.560
 utopian but also be realistic with 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.560
 the situation
