00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
different kind of vibe because it just

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.990

then I I found some pictures on
Pinterest<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:07.979> shorter<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.300> don't

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
Pinterest that are shorter but I don't

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
Pinterest that are shorter but I don't
know<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.590> every<00:02:11.250> time<00:02:11.370> I've<00:02:11.520> had<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:12.209> short

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
know so every time I've had my short

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.830

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
it's been like shorter on the top so I

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.470 
it's been like shorter on the top so I
know<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.599> still<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:17.019> super<00:02:17.530> long<00:02:17.709> but<00:02:18.480> we'll

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
know it's still not super long but we'll

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.059

show<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.459> before<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.060> what<00:02:22.150> I've<00:02:22.239> been

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.759 
show you the before so what I've been
doing<00:02:22.599> is<00:02:22.780> just<00:02:22.930> kind<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.140> pulling<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.500> back

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
doing is just kind of pulling this back

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.680 
doing is just kind of pulling this back
so<00:02:23.980> she<00:02:24.099> can't<00:02:24.340> even<00:02:24.459> deal<00:02:24.790> with<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.330> side<00:02:25.569> of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so she can't even deal with this side of

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
kind of like not digging the style I had

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.870 
kind of like not digging the style I had
it<00:04:37.290> felt<00:04:37.470> thick<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:37.980> felt<00:04:38.160> heavy<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.490> just

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
it felt thick it felt heavy I just

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.750 
it felt thick it felt heavy I just
didn't<00:04:39.210> like<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.230> we<00:04:41.040> decided<00:04:41.430> on

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
didn't like it but so we decided on

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.700 
didn't like it but so we decided on
something<00:04:42.600> similar<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.900> she's<00:04:43.170> done<00:04:43.380> before

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
something similar that she's done before

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.640 
something similar that she's done before
which<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.100> an<00:04:44.610> undercut<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:46.140> I'm<00:04:46.320> okay<00:04:46.620> with

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
which is an undercut and I'm okay with

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.970 
which is an undercut and I'm okay with
it<00:04:46.860> because<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:48.360> top<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.930> still<00:04:49.080> has<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
it because the top is still has the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.280 
it because the top is still has the
length<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> can<00:04:50.910> this<00:04:51.270> is<00:04:51.450> fine<00:04:51.690> growing<00:04:52.110> out

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
length so I can this is fine growing out

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.750 
length so I can this is fine growing out
and<00:04:52.470> then<00:04:52.560> I'll<00:04:52.650> deal<00:04:52.830> with<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.280> rest<00:04:53.310> later

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
and then I'll deal with the rest later

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.620 
and then I'll deal with the rest later
I<00:04:53.790> don't<00:04:53.940> know<00:04:54.030> we'll<00:04:54.180> deal<00:04:54.300> with<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.510> later

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
I don't know we'll deal with it later

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.060 
I don't know we'll deal with it later

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
this is good for my hair too because my

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.240 
this is good for my hair too because my

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
hair is so thick that the way that it

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.920 
hair is so thick that the way that it
looks<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.700> almost<00:05:15.030> like<00:05:15.270> somebody<00:05:15.720> with

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
looks is almost like somebody with

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.930 
looks is almost like somebody with
normal<00:05:16.440> hair<00:05:16.680> if<00:05:17.040> they<00:05:17.190> just<00:05:17.340> got<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.520> pixie<00:05:17.910> or

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
right there and then there was like

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.350 
right there and then there was like
nothing<00:06:16.200> I<00:06:16.290> could<00:06:16.470> do<00:06:16.620> or<00:06:16.860> this<00:06:17.460> one<00:06:17.700> I<00:06:17.940> mean<00:06:18.150> I

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
nothing I could do or this one I mean I

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.190 
nothing I could do or this one I mean I
can<00:06:18.680> have<00:06:19.680> that<00:06:19.800> like<00:06:19.980> shaking<00:06:20.490> ability<00:06:20.970> I

can have that like shaking ability I

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.850 
can have that like shaking ability I
guess<00:06:22.200> um

guess um

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.190 
guess um
or<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.490> can<00:06:23.640> be<00:06:23.760> smoothed<00:06:24.060> down<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:25.050> only

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
or it can be smoothed down the only

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.900 
or it can be smoothed down the only
problem<00:06:25.590> I've<00:06:25.710> had<00:06:25.740> isn't<00:06:26.370> what<00:06:26.460> I<00:06:26.520> woke<00:06:26.700> up
