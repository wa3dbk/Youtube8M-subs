people<00:02:10.530> love<00:02:10.800> these<00:02:11.400> old<00:02:11.430> RPGs<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.450> much

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
people love these old RPGs so much

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.150 
people love these old RPGs so much
I<00:02:13.400> mean<00:02:13.760> they<00:02:13.910> can't<00:02:14.150> all<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:15.160> fantastic

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
I mean they can't all be fantastic

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.530 
I mean they can't all be fantastic
there's<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:16.910> be<00:02:16.940> something<00:02:17.150> else<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.510> work

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
there's got to be something else at work

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.280 
there's got to be something else at work
here<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.650> what<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.069> sort<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> thinking<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.290> at

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
here so what I sort of thinking is at

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.610 
here so what I sort of thinking is at
this<00:02:21.800> theory<00:02:22.330> now<00:02:23.330> my<00:02:23.510> theory<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.050> people

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
this theory now my theory is that people

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.309 
this theory now my theory is that people
love<00:02:24.890> them<00:02:25.130> people<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.150> great<00:02:26.630> memories<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
love them people have great memories of

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.280 
love them people have great memories of
them<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:27.890> they're<00:02:28.190> repetitive<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:30.200> they

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
them because they're repetitive now they

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.690 
them because they're repetitive now they
may<00:02:30.380> not<00:02:30.500> make<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.680> lot<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.830> sense<00:02:30.950> raft<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.459> bat

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
may not make a lot of sense raft the bat

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.570 
may not make a lot of sense raft the bat
but<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:32.239> listen<00:02:32.599> here<00:02:33.010> now<00:02:34.010> RPGs<00:02:34.550> are

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
but but listen here now RPGs are

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.240 
but but listen here now RPGs are
extremely<00:02:35.209> repetitive<00:02:35.510> right<00:02:36.069> some<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.190> them

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
extremely repetitive right some of them

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.339 
extremely repetitive right some of them
you<00:02:37.459> some<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.970> them<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.239> spend<00:02:38.540> grinding<00:02:39.140> a

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
you some of them you spend grinding a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.850 
you some of them you spend grinding a
third<00:02:40.220> half<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> game<00:02:41.650> sometimes<00:02:42.650> more

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
third half of the game sometimes more

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.809 
third half of the game sometimes more
than<00:02:43.040> half<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:44.750> spent<00:02:45.260> using<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.549> same

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
than half is spent using the same

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.150 
than half is spent using the same
attacks<00:02:47.360> with<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.080> same<00:02:48.260> characters<00:02:48.799> against

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
attacks with the same characters against

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.640 
attacks with the same characters against
the<00:02:49.310> same<00:02:49.549> enemies<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.420> hear<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.810> same<00:02:51.110> music

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the same enemies you hear the same music

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.620 
the same enemies you hear the same music
the<00:02:51.860> same<00:02:52.100> battle<00:02:52.489> noises<00:02:52.610> over<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.450> over

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the same battle noises over and over

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.580 
the same battle noises over and over
again<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.319> 10<00:02:55.069> 15<00:02:55.459> 20<00:02:56.269> sometimes<00:02:56.690> more<00:02:57.019> hours

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
again for 10 15 20 sometimes more hours

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.449 
again for 10 15 20 sometimes more hours
in<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:58.220> single<00:02:58.549> game<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:02.110> because<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.140> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
in a single game and because of that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.780 
in a single game and because of that
these<00:03:04.459> noises<00:03:05.180> these<00:03:05.980> battle<00:03:06.980> animations<00:03:07.160> all

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
these noises these battle animations all

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.580 
these noises these battle animations all
this<00:03:07.970> stuff<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.420> ingrained<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.110> your<00:03:09.230> memory

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
this stuff is ingrained in your memory

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.920 
this stuff is ingrained in your memory
so<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.700> future<00:03:10.880> whenever<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.480> see<00:03:11.720> that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
so in the future whenever you see that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.690 
so in the future whenever you see that
again<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.410> hear<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.920> again<00:03:13.040> your<00:03:13.459> brain

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
again you hear that again your brain

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.570 
again you hear that again your brain
goes<00:03:13.970> ah<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:15.019> know<00:03:15.260> this<00:03:15.560> I'm<00:03:15.799> comfortable<00:03:16.250> with

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
goes ah I know this I'm comfortable with

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.160 
goes ah I know this I'm comfortable with
this<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:17.120> your<00:03:17.840> brain<00:03:18.019> likes<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.840> I'm

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
this and your brain likes that so I'm

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.140 
this and your brain likes that so I'm
thinking<00:03:21.230> that<00:03:21.829> this<00:03:22.010> repetitiveness<00:03:22.760> is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
thinking that this repetitiveness is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.630 
thinking that this repetitiveness is
what<00:03:23.390> creates<00:03:23.810> this<00:03:24.109> nostalgia<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.100> intense

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
what creates this nostalgia this intense

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.509 
what creates this nostalgia this intense
nostalgia<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.390> people<00:03:26.750> feel<00:03:26.989> for<00:03:27.590> old<00:03:27.769> RPGs

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
nostalgia that people feel for old RPGs

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.910 
nostalgia that people feel for old RPGs
as<00:03:28.760> opposed<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.450> other<00:03:29.930> games<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.799> know

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
as opposed to other games you know

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.640 
as opposed to other games you know
platformers<00:03:31.959> puzzle<00:03:32.959> games<00:03:33.170> things<00:03:33.560> like

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
platformers puzzle games things like

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.370 
platformers puzzle games things like
that<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:35.590> before<00:03:36.590> you<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:38.660> know<00:03:38.810> think<00:03:39.230> that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
that and before you you know think that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.990 
that and before you you know think that
that<00:03:39.500> doesn't<00:03:39.709> make<00:03:39.769> any<00:03:39.920> sense<00:03:40.220> let<00:03:40.790> me<00:03:40.850> give

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
that doesn't make any sense let me give

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400 
that doesn't make any sense let me give
you<00:03:41.090> an<00:03:41.180> example<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.810> what<00:03:41.870> really<00:03:42.230> got<00:03:42.350> me

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
you an example of what really got me

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.500 
you an example of what really got me
thinking<00:03:42.500> about<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:43.160> now<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> couple<00:03:44.209> summers

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
because school started and I really

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.870 
because school started and I really
didn't<00:04:09.470> have<00:04:09.560> time<00:04:09.769> for<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.579> I<00:04:10.609> stopped

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
didn't have time for it so I stopped

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.640 
didn't have time for it so I stopped
playing<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.359> for<00:04:11.600> about<00:04:11.750> eight<00:04:12.049> nine<00:04:12.079> months

playing it for about eight nine months

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.940 
playing it for about eight nine months
and<00:04:13.780> then<00:04:14.780> school<00:04:15.139> ended<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.829> was<00:04:15.920> a

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
and then school ended and it was a

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
fit again so what I did was I popped it

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.510 
fit again so what I did was I popped it
in<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.750> know<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:20.900> weighed<00:04:21.200> myself<00:04:21.440> but<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.310> had

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
in you know I weighed myself but I had

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.390 
in you know I weighed myself but I had
such<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.030> powerful<00:04:23.810> rush<00:04:24.409> of<00:04:24.710> nostalgia

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
such a powerful rush of nostalgia

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.980 
such a powerful rush of nostalgia
probably<00:04:26.210> one<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.570> most

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
probably one of the most

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.960 
probably one of the most
full<00:04:27.139> rushes<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.740> nostalgia<00:04:28.310> I've<00:04:28.460> had<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:28.880> a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
full rushes of nostalgia I've had in a

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.439 
full rushes of nostalgia I've had in a
long<00:04:29.000> time<00:04:29.349> for<00:04:30.349> Wii<00:04:30.620> Fit<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.180> even<00:04:32.360> a

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
long time for Wii Fit it's not even a

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.150 
long time for Wii Fit it's not even a
game<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.050> piece<00:04:33.199> of<00:04:33.229> software<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.949> helps

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
game it's a piece of software that helps

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.689 
game it's a piece of software that helps
you<00:04:34.340> exercise<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.690> why<00:04:35.960> did<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.650> feel<00:04:37.069> all<00:04:37.400> this

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
you exercise so why did I feel all this

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.850 
you exercise so why did I feel all this
nostalgia<00:04:38.599> for<00:04:38.810> Wii<00:04:39.289> Fit<00:04:39.319> of<00:04:40.069> all<00:04:40.550> things<00:04:41.860> it's

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
nostalgia for Wii Fit of all things it's

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.290 
nostalgia for Wii Fit of all things it's
because<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.310> was<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.550> same<00:04:43.729> thing<00:04:44.000> over<00:04:44.180> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
because it was the same thing over and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.749 
because it was the same thing over and
over<00:04:44.479> because<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.169> repetitive<00:04:45.759> because

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:46.759 
over because it was repetitive because

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.180 
over because it was repetitive because
my<00:04:47.210> brain<00:04:47.539> was<00:04:47.870> comfortable<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.740> that

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
my brain was comfortable with that

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.129 
my brain was comfortable with that
situation<00:04:49.569> with<00:04:50.569> doing<00:04:50.960> those<00:04:51.110> exercises

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
situation with doing those exercises

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.570 
situation with doing those exercises
because<00:04:52.009> I'd<00:04:52.250> done<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:52.819> many<00:04:52.880> times<00:04:54.580> so

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
because I'd done it so many times so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.960 
because I'd done it so many times so
this<00:04:55.819> is<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:55.970> really<00:04:56.210> intense<00:04:56.810> example<00:04:57.729> so<00:04:58.729> if

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
this is a really intense example so if

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.809 
this is a really intense example so if
something<00:04:59.270> like<00:04:59.949> we<00:05:00.949> fit<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.460> piece<00:05:01.789> of

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
something like we fit a piece of

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.230 
something like we fit a piece of
software<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:03.650> through<00:05:04.220> repetitiveness<00:05:04.819> give

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
software can through repetitiveness give

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.420 
software can through repetitiveness give
me<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.419> nostalgia<00:05:06.020> why<00:05:06.289> couldn't<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:07.400> know

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
me a nostalgia why couldn't you know

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.520 
me a nostalgia why couldn't you know
something<00:05:07.909> like<00:05:08.090> Final<00:05:08.479> Fantasy<00:05:08.599> 1<00:05:09.080> do<00:05:09.349> that

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
something like Final Fantasy 1 do that

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.760 
something like Final Fantasy 1 do that
for<00:05:10.099> you<00:05:10.250> or<00:05:10.509> dragon<00:05:11.509> warrior<00:05:11.720> three<00:05:12.409> do<00:05:12.620> that

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
for you or dragon warrior three do that

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.249 
for you or dragon warrior three do that
for<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:13.130> you<00:05:13.280> know<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:13.639> know<00:05:14.569> something<00:05:14.840> like

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
for you you know you know something like

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.140 
for you you know you know something like
Chrono<00:05:15.500> Trigger<00:05:15.560> or<00:05:16.099> final<00:05:16.400> fantasy<00:05:16.729> 7

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
Chrono Trigger or final fantasy 7

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.969 
Chrono Trigger or final fantasy 7
something<00:05:17.479> like<00:05:17.599> that<00:05:17.810> I<00:05:18.020> think<00:05:18.710> that<00:05:18.860> this

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
something like that I think that this

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.089 
something like that I think that this
makes<00:05:19.159> a<00:05:19.280> lot<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.430> sense<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.870> overall<00:05:21.740> in<00:05:22.039> a

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
makes a lot of sense so overall in a

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.120 
makes a lot of sense so overall in a
nutshell<00:05:22.419> my<00:05:23.419> theory<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.020> past<00:05:24.470> RPGs<00:05:25.099> are

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
nutshell my theory is that past RPGs are

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.870 
nutshell my theory is that past RPGs are
overrated<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.440> overpriced<00:05:27.440> because<00:05:28.310> people

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
overrated and overpriced because people

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.689 
overrated and overpriced because people
often<00:05:29.120> feel<00:05:29.750> intense<00:05:30.650> nostalgia<00:05:31.370> for<00:05:31.550> them

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
often feel intense nostalgia for them

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.570 
often feel intense nostalgia for them
and<00:05:31.820> this<00:05:32.360> is<00:05:32.479> due<00:05:32.659> to<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.810> repetitive<00:05:33.469> nature

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
and this is due to the repetitive nature

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.010 
and this is due to the repetitive nature
now<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.669> course<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:35.120> doesn't<00:05:35.389> apply<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:35.780> all

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
now of course this doesn't apply to all

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.700 
now of course this doesn't apply to all
RPGs<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:36.800> I'm<00:05:37.580> not<00:05:37.849> saying<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.449> RPGs<00:05:39.320> aren't

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
RPGs and I'm not saying that RPGs aren't

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.450 
RPGs and I'm not saying that RPGs aren't
good<00:05:40.330> all<00:05:41.330> I'm<00:05:41.630> saying<00:05:41.930> is<00:05:42.199> that<00:05:43.039> this<00:05:43.219> is<00:05:43.340> just

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
good all I'm saying is that this is just

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.260 
good all I'm saying is that this is just
a<00:05:43.610> theory<00:05:43.969> for<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.180> scores<00:05:44.659> and<00:05:44.930> prices<00:05:46.270> so

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
a theory for the scores and prices so

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.360 
a theory for the scores and prices so
I'm<00:05:47.750> gonna<00:05:47.840> ask<00:05:47.960> you<00:05:48.080> add<00:05:48.259> some<00:05:48.440> questions<00:05:48.830> one

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
I'm gonna ask you add some questions one

I'm gonna ask you add some questions one

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
what do you think of my theory does it

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.129 
what do you think of my theory does it
make<00:05:51.469> sense<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.370> it<00:05:52.550> crazy<00:05:52.789> and<00:05:53.180> why<00:05:53.960> do<00:05:54.020> you

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
make sense is it crazy and why do you

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.430 
make sense is it crazy and why do you
think<00:05:54.229> that<00:05:54.580> too<00:05:55.580> what<00:05:56.479> do<00:05:56.569> you<00:05:56.599> think<00:05:56.690> of<00:05:56.930> RPGs
