00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
about a palette that I think is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.210 
about a palette that I think is
something<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.150> should<00:00:18.180> pick<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:19.189> for<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
something that you should pick up for a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.609 
something that you should pick up for a
neutral<00:00:21.029> look<00:00:21.330> I've<00:00:21.630> been<00:00:21.930> using<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.439> Naked

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
neutral pallets out there so I'm not by

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.650 
neutral pallets out there so I'm not by
any<00:00:44.430> means<00:00:44.520> saying<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> don't<00:00:45.480> have

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
any means saying that if you don't have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.979 
any means saying that if you don't have
the<00:00:45.780> Naked<00:00:46.050> palette<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.890> can't<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.989> nude

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the Naked palette you just can't do nude

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.160 
the Naked palette you just can't do nude
eyes<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.829> neutral<00:00:50.280> look<00:00:50.489> certainly<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.480> but

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
eyes or neutral look certainly not but

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.139 
eyes or neutral look certainly not but
this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> definitely<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.640> think<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this is definitely one that I think is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
this is definitely one that I think is
worth<00:00:54.390> picking<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.500> terribly

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
worth picking up and it's not terribly

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.770 
worth picking up and it's not terribly
expensive<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:56.789> remember<00:00:57.030> exactly<00:00:57.570> how

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
expensive I can't remember exactly how

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
expensive I can't remember exactly how
much<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.620> too<00:00:58.859> bad<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
much but it's not too bad this is the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
much but it's not too bad this is the
two-faced<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.050> let<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:02.039> preface<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.640> by<00:01:02.699> saying

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
two-faced I let me preface it by saying

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.560 
two-faced I let me preface it by saying

some<00:03:55.569> depth<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.349> I<00:03:56.379> think<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.919> is<00:03:56.979> a<00:03:57.129> great

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
some depth so I think this is a great

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.899 
some depth so I think this is a great
palette<00:03:58.030> I<00:03:58.209> was<00:03:58.629> able<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:59.079> do<00:03:59.199> my<00:03:59.379> eyes<00:03:59.620> in<00:04:00.069> 10
