00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.990
 hello everybody it's simple 43 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.970
 I hope you all go very well 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.710
 and listen to me it's going great 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 today we meet for my 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.580
 first gameplay on this channel 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.349
 youtube so for a first gain 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.840
 first gameplay by no I have you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.760
 proposed really very very heavy so 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 I propose a research video 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.470
 and destruction on a mac city on call 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.550
 of duty black ops that I'm going too 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.110
 proposed side qg and code cf 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.030
 why offer them this gameplay and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.330
 well just because this one is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.869
 huge with a score really very very 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.159
 good but a particularity to the gameplay 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.140
 which in my opinion can do the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.449
 difference from moderators 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.850
 so I'll let you discover this 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 that it is and then me I will you 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.080
 talk about a little topic so he could 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.360
 you all concern yourself and so what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.939
 would be the perfect class used in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.460
 search and destruction on black ops 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.280
 because I do not really play mw3 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 so give you little tips 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.509
 for joint search and destruction 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.159
 so we'll start a little bit this 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.640
 class is good by the arms 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.409
 main and secondary 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.909
 so at the level of the main weapon I 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.770
 would you recommend lake at 47 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 so there is a very good rate of fire 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.079
 very good mobility and good 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.320
 precision you must not hide it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 does a lot of damage while skiing and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 good of secondary tears I you 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.590
 would advise a gun just in case if 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.710
 you run out of ammo 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.350
 it will allow you to kill the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.100
 enemies quite easily 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 here is after it is the weapons is 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 something that you choose in 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 according to your preferences 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.399
 I want to focus on the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.869
 assets and equipment forgiveness but 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.319
 also the series of victims 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.430
 you're going to see afterwards 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.380
 so you can see that I have 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.440
 unlocked the strategy package so who's going 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.650
 to be well the middle of this part 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.740
 since this one will completely change 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.320
 the deal you will see later 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.600
 so we will continue on the equipment 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.470
 so the flash grenades and the grenade to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.180
 fragmentation 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.620
 so the flash grenades that allows for 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.380
 take the lead over the enemies in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.630
 the orleans the flashes years he did not see 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.730
 nothing and then the grenade frag emma 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.770
 that allows and undo iron 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.990
 during kiel at very long distance 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.890
 since the grenade can bounce and 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.890
 roll on the ground 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.860
 so what offers is a very very 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 wide distances and well two shoots on 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.320
 will say afterwards with regards to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.450
 the equipment I was using I use the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.830
 fog but on this gameplay well I 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.900
 could not see it because it was my 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.370
 first part of prestige and the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.490
 fog helps to scramble 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.930
 enemy equipment and neutralize 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.970
 outright all equipment apart 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.850
 the grenades of course is it in 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.900
 complementarity and a great asset 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.220
 I quote you and after so that allows 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.380
 to have a very very good association 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.570
 and that allows practically and well 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.060
 to be intuable to equipment if we 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.440
 can say that like that it's the key he 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.240
 is by bullet so there all a vest 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.850
 bulletproof that helps to stay at 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.200
 garnets so the garnets 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.140
 can not be neutralized and well 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.260
 simply cashed the shock without 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.880
 to die and then we can not wander 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.850
 with a jammer on the whole map 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.160
 so and bullet proof vest and very useful 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.940
 against dead keys so here is this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.250
 would be my preference for coughing years 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.680
 a little parenthesis so in pro he 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.120
 lets stay at the napalm and a half 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.740
 and relaunch the grenades 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.110
 fragmentation without any risk 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.550
 so this is a big plus in terms 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.290
 there both jousts concerts and well 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.600
 obviously pro pass password which 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.000
 allows to aim and shoot and to 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.100
 recharge faster forgiveness which 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.109
 allows you to have a big big advantage over 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.030
 the night there you could see that 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.489
 on this round I made a full team 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.310
 to the death machine so this is the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.710
 little more than my video so about 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.780
 search fo side 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.430
 I hope they take it into account and 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.530
 that he takes not content with my gameplay 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.239
 it was a small parenthesis a small 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.429
 joke on my part 

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:38.619
 let's go back to our favorite class is 

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:41.739
 well we were there all three are there 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:43.509
 all three is according to how ben you 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:46.899
 play me I play with a headphone so 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:50.110
 obviously the ninja asset spring spring 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:52.809
 clearly so good the tone ja allows 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.119
 to hear the enemies which avoids 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.949
 take pirates with bulletproof vest 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:59.199
 that's a pretty rewarding combination 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.699
 as it must be said and what is 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.979
 many sets of victim I you 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.019
 advise to help all your team 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.199
 so do not use sets of 

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:10.119
 individual victims used the plane 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.830
 spy the anti spy plane as well as the 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.709
 blackbird on who will really benefit to 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.809
 your entire team which will allow well 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:19.119
 to win games quite easily 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:22.300
 here is this video ends already 

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:25.029
 on a score of 17 to 0 in research and 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.949
 destruction with a nice full team at the 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:29.139
 death machine I hope this gameplay 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.909
 you will have more he liked you do not hesitate 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.099
 not to put it in the comments 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.209
 I'll see you soon 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.379
 for new videos 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.379
 Hello everyone
