Mourinho<00:01:20.159> hinted<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> problem<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
Mourinho hinted at it the problem is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
Mourinho hinted at it the problem is
who's<00:01:21.659> gonna<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> come<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> actually

they've been used Mourinho we're saying

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770 
they've been used Mourinho we're saying
about<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> year<00:01:44.729> or<00:01:44.820> two<00:01:44.939> ago<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.420> Charlotte

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
about a year or two ago that Charlotte

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.300 
about a year or two ago that Charlotte
was<00:01:45.810> ready<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> team<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.680> lady<00:01:46.920> loaned<00:01:47.159> him

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
was ready for the team I lady loaned him

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.940 
was ready for the team I lady loaned him
out<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.549> he<00:01:47.640> hasn't<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.450> since<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
out and he hasn't been back since so I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
out and he hasn't been back since so I
think<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.720> same<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.869> any<00:01:51.960> team<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
think it's got same for any team if you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.780 
think it's got same for any team if you
do<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:52.979> season<00:01:53.340> they're<00:01:53.490> gonna<00:01:53.549> be<00:01:53.670> on

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
wherever it was cursor supposing we had

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.200
