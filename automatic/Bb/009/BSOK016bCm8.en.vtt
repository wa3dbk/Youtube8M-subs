00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 good welcome to another video that I 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.569
 several people have said to make a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.370
 book is and I'm going to do it I'm not going to 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 do about harry potter also because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.150
 the channel is dedicated to that then well what 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.860
 I do about that I'm not going to start with 20 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.929
 questions and I have to answer them 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.510
 all and that 's it and I'll start 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 now saying the and answering what 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.859
 what I think of what I feel what 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.900
 that I want to prefer in order 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.689
 first question what is your book 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.429
 favorite good my favorite book gives me 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.710
 a lot of anger this kind of questions is worth 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420
 because I do not have inside the saga no 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.489
 I have no favorite book 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 favorite movie I do not know I like them all 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 ok but if I had to always choose 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 I say the same I say the first the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.379
 first book why why that is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 the beginning of everything and it's always more 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.129
 nice is not the beginning and I do not know if I 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 I had to meet someone I wanted with 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.600
 that point although good also what is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 book book I like very much the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.039
 Finally the relics of death 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.660
 I like it a lot because because if it has 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.430
 a lot of action I do not know the truth that I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 I really like the last book as well 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 I do not know either the first or the last 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.110
 what is your favorite movie we are 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.580
 before the same thing again I do not know how to tell you 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 favorite movies the truth that I 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.790
 they all like it as a movie is also what 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.860
 what happens that some in adaptation 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.720
 they lose a little not winning is not so much 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.130
 as with the book they do not look so much like 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.460
 all way for me the first two 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 they are the best in terms of adaptation 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.070
 so I think I would stay 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 also with the first but by the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 simple fact that it is the first and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
 point is the beginning of magic 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.840
 start of everything we did not say and I 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.300
 would be with that book that less you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.600
 like 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.520
 the prisoner of azkaban if not not 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.650
 I like it but if I had to say something 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.650
 I think I would say that I do not know why but 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.750
 I've always had a little less than 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.730
 I do not appreciate that either but understand less 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.700
 the total that I'm here scratching the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.320
 First , it is the book that I would choose 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.490
 eat that I like the principle of 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.560
 finished and you're done 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.300
 well movie you least like the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.150
 prisoner of azkaban but is that 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.890
 I 'm also more boring, we said 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.780
 because they have thrown it so many times in the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.730
 tele or it has 68 movies to cast 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.100
 changed a little now just as always 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.649
 they throw the same the heavy ones and that what 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.230
 parts made you cry the deaths or 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.600
 be the most major deaths 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.410
 let's say I know for example death 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.100
 from fred 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.000
 for example the death of dhobley snape 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000
 also because of course 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.920
 and in the end it's a good twilight or 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.920
 Harry Potter 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.440
 that imposed what hope you are 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.550
 really asking twilight leaf 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.890
 of the boat I think I will not go into 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.230
 details next I give next because harry 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.540
 potter obviously is at twilight no no 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.400
 I do not like anything I hate that saga the truth 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 I do not know why but I do not like anything 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.780
 and it is also that all the suites later 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.400
 if that's what fanatics call themselves 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.200
 those who for messing with them do not 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.480
 with most of the fans I do not say 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.340
 more fanatics who say yes and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.830
 harry potter was copied from 'twilight' or 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.650
 when harry potter transcribed years and 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.050
 years before but good that they are girls and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.510
 I will not go into that either 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.210
 that character would try to conquer 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.750
 hermione granger but yes without undue criticism 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.500
 no doubts to the manga inter the master I love emma 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.500
 watson and love 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.080
 union and point and even yes what is your 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.840
 favorite character voldemort 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.750
 most people are disgusted not 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.520
 He does not like what he hates for me though 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.800
 is the perfect antagonist I like 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.840
 He has always liked much more and 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.100
 even the twitter account is for him and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.600
 It is done 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.150
 voldemort what would your patronus be 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.560
 I do not know, I do not know, the truth is that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.720
 I do not know but if I had to choose 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.540
 it would be a dog and mine a chihuahua 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.240
 ok that would be my pattern is ideal if 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.310
 You could choose Philosopher's Stone wand 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.530
 or invisibility cloak I do not know if here it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.840
 will refer to resurrection stones in 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.420
 true but good wand without a doubt 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.610
 also the wand is always in case of 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.830
 that is part of elderberry would choose the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.300
 valid because if many say bulls that 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.070
 they would kill you, but it is not necessary 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.420
 branding of wands does not need to go 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.190
 saying that you have the best wand 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.840
 of the world if you know how to master the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.400
 birds control it you do not have any 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.660
 problem and nobody is going to do you anything wrong 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.660
 I bother you one of the movies 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.380
 in what house would you be slytherin without a doubt 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.010
 slytherin for me is the house 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.980
 preferred to my opinion and I would stay 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.849
 with her without any doubt that griffin is 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.419
 a 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.039
 mix of fans and not keep believing 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.940
 in all the postulates also the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.490
 Most are posture and are there 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.680
 I do not like gryffindor I do not like which one 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.900
 is your favorite subject my subject 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.660
 favorite story of magic or 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.140
 herbology those two I can not read 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.420
 history of magic and herbology which 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.760
 is your favorite teacher my teacher 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.200
 favorite I like all the truth but 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.570
 if I had to say to someone I suppose 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.660
 that the teacher mcgonagall because 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.150
 it is hard while it is understood not 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.040
 he understands all the people of all his 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.970
 students talk to them but also 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.580
 you have that bit of that bit of hard sea 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.050
 of a heavy hand, which is what is needed in 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.040
 class not apart from being good you have to 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.230
 be tough in yours 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.720
 streep what actors you would like to know 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.540
 I would like to meet everyone 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.460
 but as before if I had to choose 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.550
 someone besides watson certainly not me 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.910
 none of them matter if she had 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.190
 what to choose 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.550
 emma watson and there is no doubt that 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.640
 successes you would like to know me by 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.640
 supposed 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.030
 empire empire waits for that of that of 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.740
 know that forgiveness that control 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.430
 who you want to make him do what 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.430
 want to be 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:02.639
 that of doing what you want, that's 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.169
 something I do not know I like I like the truth and 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.059
 I would also like the action to 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.279
 summon anything towards you to 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.379
 attract something without getting up you do not feel like 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.839
 a pizza s pizza and that also from the 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:16.649
 pizza would also be fine what games 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:18.599
 you have digital games I do not know refers 

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:20.579
 to playstation computer, so I do not 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.089
 agreement I do not remember I had the 1 no 

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:28.019
 I had 2 I had it from 5 to 5 I played 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:29.999
 but I did not have it and then I do not remember 

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:31.829
 I think the last one also played me 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.169
 they carried the computer and I left it all 

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:36.449
 I liked the manners but that's the way 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:40.039
 that what would be your position in quid and 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:43.169
 the truth is that I suppose that seeker 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:47.209
 because I'm pretty skillful flexible I do not know 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.209
 I guess it would be fine as a search engine 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.290
 You stayed satisfied with the final by 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.270
 course it did not change anything in the saga or 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:58.880
 it did not change anything as it is 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.670
 well what does harry potter mean to you? 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.620
 after all my childhood means the 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.390
 true that is because I started reading it to 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.870
 the 11 years and rehearsed has meant 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:10.610
 all my childhood supporters of the 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.140
 adolescence so part 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.990
 so that means a lot to me 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.100
 true a lot and up to here the ebook such 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.930
 from harry potter I hope you have 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.090
 liked we'll see you in the next video 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.520
 which I hope is already one of tutorials 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.370
 of new ones and if you have any 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.050
 special weakness for something tell me 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.390
 down here in the comments on twitter 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.120
 with lies as always and we're going 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.540
 doing there is no prepared whatever for 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.540
 whatever is 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.050
 and where leather
