in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.399> I'd<00:00:02.610> like<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.850> explain<00:00:03.330> how<00:00:03.389> we

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
in this video I'd like to explain how we

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.390 
in this video I'd like to explain how we
know<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.020> many<00:00:04.290> calories<00:00:04.650> are<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.130> different

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
know how many calories are in different

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.179 
know how many calories are in different
types<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.879> food<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.390> other<00:00:06.839> words<00:00:07.109> how<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.069> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
review what a calorie is before I can

calorie<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.580> defined<00:01:06.610> as<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.450> quantity<00:01:07.600> of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
calorie is defined as the quantity of

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.560 
calorie is defined as the quantity of
heat<00:01:08.290> necessary<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:09.070> raise<00:01:09.250> one<00:01:09.550> kilogram<00:01:10.000> or

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
heat necessary to raise one kilogram or

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.080 
heat necessary to raise one kilogram or
one<00:01:10.930> liter<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.350> water<00:01:11.740> 1<00:01:12.160> degrees<00:01:12.520> Celsius

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
one liter of water 1 degrees Celsius

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.590 
one liter of water 1 degrees Celsius
that's<00:01:13.540> 1,000<00:01:14.350> grams<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.700> this<00:01:16.060> calorie<00:01:16.420> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
that's 1,000 grams so this calorie is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.410 
that's 1,000 grams so this calorie is
actually<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.080> kilo<00:01:17.650> gram<00:01:17.890> calorie<00:01:18.369> hence<00:01:18.759> kilo

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
actually a kilo gram calorie hence kilo

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.840 
actually a kilo gram calorie hence kilo

the<00:04:05.530> fact<00:04:05.830> is<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.099> we<00:04:06.400> are<00:04:06.430> not<00:04:06.670> capable<00:04:06.970> of
