00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.149
 Hi all I am are as they know the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.580
 clouds photography welcome again 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.670
 more to a magic tutorial a couple of 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.280
 clicks in this video tutorial let's see 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.740
 How to replace the color of an element or 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.199
 of one object for another in this case 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.659
 we have a photograph of the beach of 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.980
 foce in oporto in portugal and what 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.989
 I want to do what I want to do 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.349
 sorry is to replace the color of this 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:30.599
 umbrella that is dark blue for a 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.180
 the red color to give it more vividness and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.440
 more contrast to photography and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.030
 contrast what looks good on the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.340
 contrast of red with this blue 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.440
 for it as almost always the first 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.969
 what we are going to do is duplicate the layer of 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.280
 background and we do it by pressing command j if 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.339
 we have mac on our keyboard control j 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.860
 if it is not mac if we have a pc and if not 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.140
 we click on the background layer and we 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.050
 we take to this icon that is here for 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.239
 that we duplicate it 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.950
 the next step that we have to give already 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 you will see that it is very simple and what 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.020
 let's quickly do the following 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.690
 step is to select the tool 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.909
 quick selection this little brush there 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.909
 here the quick selection brush that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.860
 If you do not see it, start counting the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 icons that are from above the room 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 starting from above to the best 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.220
 the magic wand tool appears 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 but below it is the tool 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.840
 quick selection so if you see this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 wand here leave the cursor poked 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 over to open this panel and I 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.530
 and now you can choose the tool 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.149
 quick selection tool 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.160
 quick selection what we are what 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.800
 let's do is paint on the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.470
 selection that we want to make and 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.840
 photoshop that is super smart you are going to see 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.179
 how well you select it and what 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.789
 correctly what do I have 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.160
 selected here a brush of 50 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.110
 pixels but we can make it bigger 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.429
 or smaller and I've already tried and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.250
 I know that this is the one that will be going well 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.810
 so let's start with the other thing 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.700
 that I also want to tell you we have 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.720
 up here three icons of three 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.630
 paint brush 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.899
 one of them this helps us to do 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.550
 a new selection here we add to the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.280
 we have made selection 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.860
 adding things and here we subtract it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.930
 to see 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.420
 for the moment I have added the middle one 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.860
 which is to add to the selection I have 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020
 added pardon I have selected the one from 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 means that the selection will be added and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.270
 let's start doing to select 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.270
 painting over the areas we want 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.409
 is working painting on the areas 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.409
 that we want to see here is already 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.730
 and we will finish here 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 we already have it selected 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.209
 Imagine that for example, the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.730
 brush and we take that we paint here without 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.970
 want and we have selected this part 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.480
 of the rock as the best way to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.280
 remove this selection is to go to these 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.500
 brush landmarks here and say subtraction 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.360
 I got the wrong thing from the selection 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.069
 remove the grouper so we click on the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.980
 brush and me that has a symbol 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.420
 negative and we paint in the part that 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.180
 we had selected but that in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.560
 actually we do not want it to be selected and 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.560
 the selection will disappear 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.540
 He is working as it is because it has 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.240
 remained the selection made just as 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.940
 we wanted if you look closely 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.060
 I'm going to expand a little bit with the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.880
 magnifying glass if you look closely 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.950
 here is an area of a white border in 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.430
 the umbrella with the tips of the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.200
 umbrellas rods you see what 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.860
 well work what tool more 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.680
 powerful is this within photoshop what 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.010
 all this white trim has left him without 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.580
 selecting is very easy very simple 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.400
 let's make the picture again more 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.700
 little girl 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.700
 there 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.390
 for here is very good 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.060
 Now that we have selected the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.570
 part of the umbrella that we 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.530
 we want to change the color we could 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.750
 perfect this selection here in 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.660
 perfect edge in this case not what 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.090
 I'm going to do it because it's been very good and 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.950
 I think it's perfect then it's not 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.080
 I'm going to play the perfect edge 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.470
 but you can do it well 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.780
 try here in softened in contrast 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.910
 You can make small small niggles 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.230
 arrangements when you make a selection I'll 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.600
 to click on ok because it does not make me 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.160
 need to do anything the next step 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.490
 we have to give to change the color of 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.050
 the umbrella is to go to these icons and 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.340
 click on this we know also 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.400
 which is to create a new layer of 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.040
 adjustment 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.560
 we go on the panel that unfolds 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.270
 we have here a series of options and 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.580
 let's choose tone and saturation 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.380
 you are seeing that we are going to put it 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.560
 here so that we see it well now 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.510
 when we change the color 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.669
 you are seeing that what has created us 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.150
 is a new adjustment layer with a 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.850
 mask a black mask in which what 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 that is revealed only as far as what 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
 that part of the photograph that goes to 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.700
 affect our adjustment is only to the 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.169
 part that appears in white that 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.770
 corresponds to the selection that we have 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.320
 I actually going to start changing color 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.000
 first let's move the tone the cursor 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.440
 of tone we will not take it to red 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.450
 because what I want is for him to put on 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.150
 red color here we are doing little 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.620
 adjustments little by little until until 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.430
 let's stay with what we want 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.430
 saturation 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.570
 it gets them a lot more 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.540
 I want to spend because it has to be 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.910
 natural I think that would be fine and 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:00.210
 maybe it luminance a tad of nothing 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.340
 Well, I think that's fine and the 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.760
 next step what is the next step 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.140
 is to change the layer blending mode already 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.590
 you know that by clicking here in these 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.110
 little arrows unfolds a menu with all 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.990
 the different layer fusing modes and 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.650
 let's choose in this case the mode 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.170
 color look good on the part in the 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.760
 red umbrella as though the change is 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.280
 very subtle yes that changes 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.990
 you have seen it good because you have seen 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.700
 that with the color merge mode it 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.800
 they preserve a little more the shadows and 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:36.310
 the details that were in the umbrella 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.130
 well, we have changed very easily 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.560
 the color of the umbrella in other 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.260
 photographs maybe when you have to 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.610
 make a selection of an item that 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.200
 is a little more complicated is going to 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.560
 cost a little more but good and 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.990
 you know what the process is and what is done 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.520
 very quickly I hope that I have 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.260
 I hope that I serve you not 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.150
 use and above all that you are 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.190
 with me in the next video tutorial and 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.180
 who knows in the clouds photograph many 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.180
 thank you and see you next time
