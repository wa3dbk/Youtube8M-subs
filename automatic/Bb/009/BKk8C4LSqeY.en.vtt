00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.030 
guys I thought it would have been easier
for<00:01:41.220> me<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> canned<00:01:42.479> soup<00:01:42.930> which<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
for me to do the canned soup which I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
for me to do the canned soup which I
kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.729> regret<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.240> decision<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
kind of regret that decision because I

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.200 
kind of regret that decision because I
think<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.460> taking<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.909> more

beef but I also purchased some ground
turkey<00:03:59.459> um<00:04:01.790> I'm<00:04:02.790> probably<00:04:03.180> gonna<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
turkey um I'm probably gonna do the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.809 
turkey um I'm probably gonna do the
ground<00:04:04.139> turkey<00:04:04.440> instead<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.949> the<00:04:05.160> beef<00:04:05.370> and

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
ground turkey instead of the beef and

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.170 
ground turkey instead of the beef and
I'm<00:04:06.299> probably<00:04:06.480> gonna<00:04:06.750> make<00:04:07.049> some<00:04:07.879> like<00:04:08.879> some

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
I'm probably gonna make some like some

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.039 
I'm probably gonna make some like some
burger<00:04:09.569> patties<00:04:10.549> type<00:04:11.549> things<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.269> eat<00:04:12.900> it

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
burger patties type things and eat it

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.470 
burger patties type things and eat it
with<00:04:13.199> a<00:04:13.230> salad<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.160> I'm<00:04:14.579> probably<00:04:14.910> gonna<00:04:15.209> do

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
with a salad and I'm probably gonna do

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.409 
with a salad and I'm probably gonna do
that<00:04:15.690> more<00:04:16.199> than<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.680> one<00:04:16.979> day<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.549> think<00:04:18.120> that

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that more than the one day I think that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.629 
that more than the one day I think that
I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.199> cost<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:19.709> day<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.160> that

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
I think that I cost for one day of that

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.069 
I think that I cost for one day of that
and<00:04:21.000> I'm<00:04:21.150> probably<00:04:21.329> gonna<00:04:21.539> do<00:04:21.719> it<00:04:21.840> for<00:04:21.959> maybe

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
and I'm probably gonna do it for maybe

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.140 
and I'm probably gonna do it for maybe
two<00:04:22.440> days<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.039> make<00:04:23.190> sure<00:04:23.219> I'm<00:04:23.849> getting

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
two days just to make sure I'm getting

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.430 
two days just to make sure I'm getting
my<00:04:24.360> protein<00:04:24.599> I'm<00:04:25.020> off

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
my protein I'm off

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.870 
my protein I'm off
and<00:04:25.920> most<00:04:26.460> high<00:04:26.700> in<00:04:27.120> vitamin<00:04:27.770> I<00:04:28.770> also<00:04:29.520> have

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
and most high in vitamin I also have

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.850 
and most high in vitamin I also have
fresh<00:04:30.600> tomatoes<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.260> I'm<00:04:31.380> probably<00:04:31.650> gonna

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
fresh tomatoes but I'm probably gonna

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.350 
fresh tomatoes but I'm probably gonna
also<00:04:32.210> saute<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.420> put<00:04:33.690> with<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.050> soup<00:04:35.360> which

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
also saute and put with the soup which

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.630 
also saute and put with the soup which
is<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:37.140> as<00:04:37.380> I'm<00:04:37.590> sitting<00:04:37.920> here<00:04:38.040> saying<00:04:38.100> this

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
is like as I'm sitting here saying this

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.670 
is like as I'm sitting here saying this
I<00:04:38.940> probably<00:04:39.360> should<00:04:39.720> have<00:04:39.750> just<00:04:40.020> did<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.380> soup

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.900 
I probably should have just did the soup
