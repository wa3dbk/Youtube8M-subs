on<00:00:47.120> tortoise<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.500> is<00:00:48.649> probably<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.280> only

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
on tortoise this is probably the only

on tortoise this is probably the only
fight<00:00:50.000> in<00:00:50.210> which<00:00:50.390> I<00:00:50.660> am<00:00:50.780> a<00:00:50.809> bit<00:00:51.110> concerned

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
fight in which I am a bit concerned

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.319 
fight in which I am a bit concerned
about<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.980> Vengeance<00:00:52.399> changes<00:00:52.940> purely

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
about the Vengeance changes purely

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.720 
about the Vengeance changes purely
because<00:00:53.690> my<00:00:54.170> DPS<00:00:54.710> during<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.280> fight<00:00:55.550> has

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
because my DPS during this fight has

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.779 
because my DPS during this fight has
been<00:00:56.059> quite<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.140> contributing<00:00:57.920> factor<00:00:58.610> to

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
been quite a contributing factor to

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.660 
been quite a contributing factor to
downing<00:00:59.750> these<00:00:59.989> vampiric<00:01:00.770> bats<00:01:01.129> that<00:01:01.399> come

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
downing these vampiric bats that come

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.939 
downing these vampiric bats that come
periodically<00:01:02.120> throughout<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.840> fight<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.770> I

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
periodically throughout the fight and I

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.170 
periodically throughout the fight and I
do<00:01:04.009> worry<00:01:04.339> what<00:01:04.580> will<00:01:04.699> happen<00:01:04.970> when<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
do worry what will happen when the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.950 
do worry what will happen when the
vengeance<00:01:05.690> changes<00:01:06.289> go<00:01:06.680> live<00:01:07.039> but<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.270> do<00:01:08.360> agree

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
vengeance changes go live but I do agree

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.050 
vengeance changes go live but I do agree
that<00:01:09.080> tanks<00:01:09.920> should<00:01:10.250> not<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:10.700> at<00:01:10.789> the<00:01:10.880> top<00:01:11.030> of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
that tanks should not be at the top of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.930 
that tanks should not be at the top of
the<00:01:11.210> DPS<00:01:11.660> meters<00:01:12.220> originally<00:01:13.220> vengeance<00:01:13.729> was

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
the DPS meters originally vengeance was

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.109 
the DPS meters originally vengeance was
brought<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:14.420> due<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.140> fact<00:01:15.440> that<00:01:15.700> DPS<00:01:16.700> gear

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
brought in due to the fact that DPS gear

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.060 
brought in due to the fact that DPS gear
as<00:01:17.420> people<00:01:17.930> increase<00:01:18.320> their<00:01:18.350> eye<00:01:18.619> level<00:01:18.860> and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
as people increase their eye level and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.609 
as people increase their eye level and
got<00:01:19.250> better<00:01:19.490> gear<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.330> got<00:01:20.600> harder<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.229> harder

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
got better gear it got harder and harder

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.580 
got better gear it got harder and harder
to<00:01:21.799> close<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.310> gap<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:23.299> hold<00:01:23.869> aggro<00:01:24.439> on

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
to close the gap and to hold aggro on

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.230 
to close the gap and to hold aggro on
everything<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:25.460> let's<00:01:25.670> go<00:01:25.850> through<00:01:26.090> what
