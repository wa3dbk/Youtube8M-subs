00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.430
Look at my back,
look at my back!

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:08.562
Take a look!

00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:10.394
Bad!

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:13.882
I've been working out!

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.211
You will see!

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:21.449
Did you score?

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.976
I shot...

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.315
LÃ©o passed the ball to me,
then I shot,

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:30.651
the ball hit the goalie
and then Matheus scored.

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.985
Cristiano, Cristiano!

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.858
Do the scissors move!

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:34.381
Come on,
come on!

00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:37.369
Look at him!

00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:42.225
That's enough!

00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:12.938
Come on, guys!

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.667
Change your course
and speed up at my signal!

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:19.304
Go!

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:20.496
That's right.

00:02:20.587 --> 00:02:21.497
Go!

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:22.615
That's okay.

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:27.495
Keep off the wall
and start moving your arms.

00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:30.228
One, two, three, four...

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.740
Let's go, guys!

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.735
Come on!

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.795
That's right, guys,
let's go!

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.991
This is going to be a very
tough match, we must be smart!

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:46.418
We must be smart,
we must work the ball.

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:53.445
Everyone must play
when we have the ball,

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:55.040
and everyone must mark
when we lose it.

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:00.644
Let's go, guys!

00:04:23.182 --> 00:04:24.267
It was the first time
I scored playing here,

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.067
I'm very happy
I managed to help the team,

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:31.818
congratulations to everyone,
the team was very committed,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.692
thanks for your support!

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.206
The victory is all that matters,

00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:39.320
I'd like to thank everyone,
and now let's keep improving,

00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:42.104
there's a very important
match coming on Thursday,

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:43.641
and we hope to win.

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:46.150
I'd like to say thanks
to God and to our fans!

00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:47.595
It's a very important victory,

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:49.902
we scored three points,
we were very committed,

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:52.643
we know we must improve,
especially during the second half,

00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:54.206
but we scored the three points,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.890
our fans were crucial,

00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:58.607
now we'll try to establish
a winning streak...

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.438
playing away to work
our way up the table.

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:01.885
I love you, Santos FC!
