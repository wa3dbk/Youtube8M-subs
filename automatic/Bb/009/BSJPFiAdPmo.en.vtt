00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
about the biggest in on the car I think

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.859

pretty<00:01:05.369> straight

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.050 

very<00:01:08.530> little<00:01:08.799> rust<00:01:09.130> in<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.520> car<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:11.409> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
very little rust in this car was a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.850 
very little rust in this car was a
California<00:01:13.060> car<00:01:13.479> from<00:01:13.900> out<00:01:14.229> in<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.470> desert
