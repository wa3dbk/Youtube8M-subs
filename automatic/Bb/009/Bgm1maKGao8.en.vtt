happens the slightest bit of tension
here<00:01:46.280> limits<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.390> then

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
here limits what you can do that then

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
here limits what you can do that then
when<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.649> weight<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.430> tends<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
when you put weight on it it tends to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.840 
when you put weight on it it tends to
pull<00:01:51.420> down

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
pull down

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.390 
pull down
so<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.390> not<00:01:53.600> gain<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.229> much<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.070> slide

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
so you not gain this much and then slide

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.870 
so you not gain this much and then slide
down<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.759> little<00:01:55.970> bit

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
down a little bit

I tried this on a number of trees in the

I tried this on a number of trees in the
past<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.869> I've<00:02:01.960> retried<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.679> just<00:02:02.950> moments

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
well I've tried to go up this tree using

well I've tried to go up this tree using
this<00:02:06.039> at<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.429> it's<00:02:06.640> pretty<00:02:06.909> tedious<00:02:07.619> really

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
this at it it's pretty tedious really

could use what I've done now is reduce
this<00:02:20.920> down<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.549> just<00:02:21.730> one<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> cinder<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:23.620> could

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
this down to just one a cinder you could

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.740 
this down to just one a cinder you could
replace<00:02:24.129> this<00:02:24.519> as<00:02:24.730> well<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.629> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
replace this as well but in the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.610 
replace this as well but in the

this blue rope is a backup and I've got

this blue rope is a backup and I've got

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
a three wrap prusik on it and it doesn't

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.660 
a three wrap prusik on it and it doesn't
have<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.989> do<00:03:20.170> a<00:03:20.200> whole<00:03:20.530> lot<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.069> when<00:03:21.549> I'm

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
have to do a whole lot and when I'm

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.490 
have to do a whole lot and when I'm
playing<00:03:22.000> with<00:03:22.209> it<00:03:22.269> I've<00:03:22.510> got<00:03:22.720> both<00:03:22.959> hands<00:03:23.290> to

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
playing with it I've got both hands to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.059 
playing with it I've got both hands to
loosen<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.100> work<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.440> it's<00:03:26.650> kind<00:03:26.889> of<00:03:26.950> a

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
loosen it and work it so it's kind of a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.539 
loosen it and work it so it's kind of a
static<00:03:27.549> thing<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.750> helical<00:03:29.290> knot<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.859> order

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
static thing the helical knot and order

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.240 
static thing the helical knot and order
for<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:30.940> perform<00:03:31.420> efficiently<00:03:31.920> has<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
for this to perform efficiently has to

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.339 
for this to perform efficiently has to
move<00:03:33.519> so<00:03:34.030> that's<00:03:34.180> why<00:03:34.450> I'm<00:03:34.599> using<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.959> helical

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
move so that's why I'm using the helical

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.710 
move so that's why I'm using the helical
here<00:03:35.680> instead<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.639> prusik<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.239> you'll<00:03:37.329> see

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
here instead of a prusik and you'll see

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.349 
here instead of a prusik and you'll see
the<00:03:38.470> performance<00:03:39.099> of<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.370> helical<00:03:40.030> not<00:03:40.209> in

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
the performance of this helical not in

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.720 
the performance of this helical not in
just<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.660> second<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.230> I'm<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.250> clip<00:03:42.489> in

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
just a second so I'm going to clip in

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.870 
just a second so I'm going to clip in
here<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:44.139> I<00:03:44.290> know<00:03:44.590> my<00:03:44.859> ground<00:03:45.160> camera<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:45.849> a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
here and I know my ground camera is a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.479 
here and I know my ground camera is a
good<00:03:46.480> way<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.560> you're<00:03:47.769> not<00:03:47.859> probably<00:03:48.310> going<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
good way so you're not probably going to

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.970 
good way so you're not probably going to
get<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:48.669> lot<00:03:48.849> of<00:03:48.880> detail<00:03:49.389> from<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.709> I'm<00:03:50.799> going

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
get a lot of detail from it so I'm going

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.879 
get a lot of detail from it so I'm going
to<00:03:51.040> try<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.370> remember<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.329> keep<00:03:53.200> my<00:03:53.410> helmet-cam

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
to try to remember to keep my helmet-cam

here's<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.239> helical<00:03:58.660> one<00:03:58.780> I'm<00:03:58.959> just<00:03:58.989> going<00:03:59.260> to

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
here's the helical one I'm just going to

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.860 
here's the helical one I'm just going to
slide<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.680> up<00:03:59.980> now<00:04:00.280> it's<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.389> now<00:04:01.599> beginning

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
slide it up now it's just now beginning

slide it up now it's just now beginning
the<00:04:02.260> load<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.150> you'll<00:04:04.150> see<00:04:04.389> it<00:04:04.510> kind<00:04:04.840> of

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
the load and you'll see it kind of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.009 
the load and you'll see it kind of

me<00:04:30.090> B<00:04:30.660> line<00:04:30.930> would<00:04:31.410> be<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.620> thing<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.070> use<00:04:32.190> for

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
me B line would be the thing to use for

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.280 
me B line would be the thing to use for
this<00:04:32.669> all<00:04:33.390> right<00:04:33.540> let's<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:33.810> started<00:04:33.960> right

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
this all right let's get started right

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.280 
this all right let's get started right
quick<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.190> get<00:04:36.120> my<00:04:36.270> feet<00:04:36.540> in<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:37.080> foot

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
quick I have to get my feet in the foot

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.850 
quick I have to get my feet in the foot
loops

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
loops

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.210 
loops
all<00:04:38.760> right<00:04:38.910> I've<00:04:39.000> already<00:04:39.210> got<00:04:39.390> my<00:04:40.220> helical

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
all right I've already got my helical

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.580 
all right I've already got my helical
loaded<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.850> I'm<00:04:42.480> gonna<00:04:42.630> swing<00:04:42.930> into<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.260> tree

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
loaded so I'm gonna swing into the tree

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.700 
loaded so I'm gonna swing into the tree
and<00:04:44.060> raise<00:04:45.060> my<00:04:45.480> foot<00:04:45.690> ascender<00:04:46.110> so<00:04:46.290> my<00:04:46.440> knees

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
and raise my foot ascender so my knees

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.170 
and raise my foot ascender so my knees
are<00:04:47.040> bent<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:48.620> I'm<00:04:49.620> ready<00:04:50.070> to<00:04:50.220> go<00:04:50.310> up<00:04:50.520> watch

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
are bent and I'm ready to go up watch

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.760 
are bent and I'm ready to go up watch
the<00:04:51.570> helical<00:04:52.140> I<00:04:54.110> don't<00:04:55.110> know<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.530> gets

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
the helical I don't know that it gets

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.050 
the helical I don't know that it gets
any<00:04:55.950> easier<00:04:56.040> than<00:04:56.610> that<00:04:57.020> advance<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.230> foot

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
any easier than that advance the foot

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.690 
any easier than that advance the foot
advance<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.270> helical<00:05:00.770> as<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.890> can<00:05:02.040> see<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.310> ran

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
advance the helical as you can see I ran

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.210 
advance the helical as you can see I ran
right<00:05:03.030> into<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.480> it's<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.900> fast<00:05:04.230> now<00:05:04.530> what<00:05:05.190> I

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
right into that it's so fast now what I

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:13.880 
right into that it's so fast now what I
do<00:05:05.340> here<00:05:05.790> I<00:05:06.590> tightened<00:05:07.590> this<00:05:07.770> one<00:05:12.680> I'm<00:05:13.680> gonna

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
do here I tightened this one I'm gonna

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.130 
do here I tightened this one I'm gonna
load<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.310> in<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.640> minute<00:05:14.760> by<00:05:15.419> taking<00:05:15.990> my

load it in just a minute by taking my
foot<00:05:16.410> ascender<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.160> putting<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.210> over<00:05:18.300> here

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
foot ascender and putting it over here

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.620 
foot ascender and putting it over here
reason<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.680> want<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:19.950> do<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.370> I've<00:05:21.150> got<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.540> get

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
reason I want to do that I've got to get

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.400 
reason I want to do that I've got to get
some<00:05:21.840> load<00:05:22.110> off<00:05:22.350> of<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:24.080> because<00:05:25.080> I'm<00:05:25.260> gonna

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
some load off of that because I'm gonna

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.020 
some load off of that because I'm gonna
move<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.919> whole<00:05:26.160> thing<00:05:26.220> up

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
move this whole thing up

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.080 
move this whole thing up
all<00:05:27.510> right<00:05:27.690> now<00:05:27.870> I'm<00:05:28.080> on<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.380> prusik<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:29.910> I'm

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
all right now I'm on the prusik and I'm

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.540 
all right now I'm on the prusik and I'm
just<00:05:30.270> gonna<00:05:30.419> I<00:05:30.540> mean<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.979> helical<00:05:31.979> I'm<00:05:32.370> gonna

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
just gonna I mean the helical I'm gonna

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.900 
just gonna I mean the helical I'm gonna
fix<00:05:32.790> some<00:05:32.970> rope<00:05:33.180> through<00:05:33.419> that<00:05:34.340> I'm<00:05:35.340> gonna<00:05:35.610> put

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
fix some rope through that I'm gonna put

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.840 
fix some rope through that I'm gonna put
my<00:05:36.290> foot<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.320> cinder<00:05:37.710> up<00:05:37.890> as<00:05:38.070> high<00:05:38.250> as<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.520> can<00:05:38.700> get

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
my foot a cinder up as high as I can get

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.400 
my foot a cinder up as high as I can get
it<00:05:39.830> move<00:05:40.830> way<00:05:41.280> up<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.700> tree<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.780> you<00:05:42.840> can<00:05:43.020> see

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
it move way up the tree and you can see

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.320 
it move way up the tree and you can see
how<00:05:43.620> much<00:05:43.770> I<00:05:43.979> gained<00:05:44.280> in<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.610> one<00:05:44.820> stroke

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.820 

this<00:05:48.330> works<00:05:48.660> really<00:05:48.960> good<00:05:49.200> on<00:05:49.380> these<00:05:49.500> small

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
this works really good on these small

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.610 
this works really good on these small
diameter<00:05:50.340> trees<00:05:51.169> because<00:05:52.169> you<00:05:52.320> can<00:05:52.440> reach

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
diameter trees because you can reach

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.550 
diameter trees because you can reach
around<00:05:52.979> them<00:05:53.630> alrighty<00:05:55.520> I'll<00:05:56.520> switch<00:05:56.820> the

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
around them alrighty I'll switch the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.860 
around them alrighty I'll switch the
foot<00:05:58.560> ascender<00:05:58.919> back<00:05:59.130> to<00:05:59.280> my<00:05:59.460> main<00:06:00.390> climbing

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
foot ascender back to my main climbing

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:14.020 
foot ascender back to my main climbing
line<00:06:01.280> I'm<00:06:02.280> ready<00:06:02.520> for<00:06:02.700> another<00:06:02.760> pitch

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.070 

now<00:06:15.030> interestingly<00:06:15.690> enough<00:06:16.110> I<00:06:16.730> can<00:06:18.080> then

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
now interestingly enough I can then

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.730 
now interestingly enough I can then
climb<00:06:19.440> on<00:06:19.650> this<00:06:19.860> I'm<00:06:20.610> going<00:06:20.850> to<00:06:20.910> release<00:06:21.210> my

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
climb on this I'm going to release my

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.480 
climb on this I'm going to release my
second<00:06:22.740> tie<00:06:22.950> in<00:06:23.010> here<00:06:23.310> so<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:23.520> can<00:06:23.790> do<00:06:23.940> this<00:06:25.430> if<00:06:26.430> I

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
second tie in here so I can do this if I

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.330 
second tie in here so I can do this if I
didn't<00:06:26.760> want<00:06:26.910> to<00:06:26.970> die<00:06:27.120> down<00:06:27.720> climb<00:06:28.110> I<00:06:28.380> could

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
didn't want to die down climb I could

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.450 
didn't want to die down climb I could
simply<00:06:29.700> install<00:06:30.030> my<00:06:30.210> climbing<00:06:30.660> line<00:06:31.250> load<00:06:32.250> it

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
simply install my climbing line load it

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.860 
simply install my climbing line load it
well<00:06:33.300> on<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:33.600> descender<00:06:34.530> see<00:06:35.100> my<00:06:35.280> rig<00:06:35.550> and<00:06:35.940> go

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
well on a descender see my rig and go

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.770 
well on a descender see my rig and go
down<00:06:37.050> like<00:06:37.260> that<00:06:37.320> but<00:06:37.770> if<00:06:38.640> I<00:06:38.820> were<00:06:39.030> only<00:06:39.150> five

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
down like that but if I were only five

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.500 
down like that but if I were only five
six<00:06:40.140> ten<00:06:40.500> feet<00:06:40.770> up<00:06:40.919> maybe<00:06:41.220> may<00:06:42.000> not<00:06:42.180> be<00:06:42.330> worth

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
six ten feet up maybe may not be worth

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.990 
six ten feet up maybe may not be worth
it<00:06:42.690> because<00:06:42.780> I<00:06:43.290> can<00:06:43.919> actually<00:06:44.310> walk<00:06:44.520> down<00:06:44.550> on

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
it because I can actually walk down on

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.650 
it because I can actually walk down on
this<00:06:45.090> helical<00:06:45.570> but<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.860> secret<00:06:47.220> is<00:06:47.280> this

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
this helical but the secret is this

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.590 
this helical but the secret is this
stand<00:06:48.660> up<00:06:48.900> advance<00:06:49.680> it<00:06:49.890> and<00:06:50.100> it<00:06:51.060> comes<00:06:51.330> down

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
stand up advance it and it comes down

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.440 
stand up advance it and it comes down
and<00:06:51.890> you<00:06:52.890> see<00:06:53.190> I<00:06:53.220> used<00:06:53.550> two<00:06:53.760> fingers<00:06:54.180> to<00:06:54.330> do

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
and you see I used two fingers to do

00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:02.450 
and you see I used two fingers to do
that<00:06:55.880> stand<00:06:56.880> up<00:06:59.419> stand<00:07:00.419> up<00:07:00.750> breaks<00:07:01.140> it<00:07:01.320> move<00:07:02.310> it

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
that stand up stand up breaks it move it

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.200 
that stand up stand up breaks it move it
down<00:07:02.700> and<00:07:03.210> you<00:07:04.020> can<00:07:04.050> see<00:07:04.730> I'm<00:07:05.730> moving<00:07:06.030> down

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
down and you can see I'm moving down
