talk about a little something different
that<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.750> made<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.289> maintenance<00:00:16.830> tractor

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
that we made it's a maintenance tractor

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.230 
that we made it's a maintenance tractor
app<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.420> iPhone<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.140> iPad<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
app for your iPhone or iPad and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.689 
app for your iPhone or iPad and
basically<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.510> reason<00:00:22.100> that<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.250> did<00:00:23.490> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
basically the reason that we did this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.359 
basically the reason that we did this
was<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:25.619> know<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:25.830> you're<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.130> me

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
was because you know if you're like me

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.490 
was because you know if you're like me
you<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> work<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.510> bike<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.050> may

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you like to work on your bike you may

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
you like to work on your bike you may
have<00:00:28.680> multiple<00:00:28.800> bikes<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:30.029> hard<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
have multiple bikes and it's hard to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.600 
have multiple bikes and it's hard to
keep<00:00:30.689> track<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.349> exactly<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.070> did<00:00:32.250> for

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
keep track of exactly what you did for

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
keep track of exactly what you did for
instance<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.469> put<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.620> sealant<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> your

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
instance if you put some sealant in your

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.220 
instance if you put some sealant in your
tire<00:00:35.520> two<00:00:35.940> months<00:00:36.239> ago<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> forget

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tire two months ago you kind of forget

tire two months ago you kind of forget
when<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.590> did<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.460> app<00:00:39.140> we<00:00:40.140> created

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
number you can enter in your some of the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
number you can enter in your some of the
fit<00:00:59.879> dimensions<00:01:00.480> how<00:01:00.899> much<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> weighs

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
fit dimensions how much it weighs

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
what we call the component section so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.620 
what we call the component section so
you<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> enter<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.390> each

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
you can have you can enter in each
individual<00:01:16.259> component<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
individual component and all the

information about that component and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
information about that component and
finally<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:21.990> sort<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> crux<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> app

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
finally them sort of the crux of the app

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
finally them sort of the crux of the app
is<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> maintain<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.619> bike<00:01:27.439> you

front tire stick it here there's a
scrolling<00:01:36.540> screen<00:01:39.890> into<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.920> front<00:01:41.189> tire

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
scrolling screen into the front tire

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
scrolling screen into the front tire
when<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> did<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.189> brand<00:01:45.149> name

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
when you did it what you did brand name

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
when you did it what you did brand name
and<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:47.220> keeps<00:01:47.520> track<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.869> bat<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.369> cool

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and that keeps track of a bat the cool

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.819 
and that keeps track of a bat the cool
part<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.299> app<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.409> maintain

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
part about this app is the the maintain

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.120 
part about this app is the the maintain
function<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.479> hit<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
function so you hit that you go and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.380 
function so you hit that you go and
suppose<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.719> added<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> new<00:01:57.960> chain<00:01:59.270> pick<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
suppose you added a new chain pick it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.260 
suppose you added a new chain pick it
out<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> list<00:02:00.930> here<00:02:01.049> chain<00:02:04.909> when<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> did

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
out of the list here chain when you did

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.520 
out of the list here chain when you did
it<00:02:06.770> maybe<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.069> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> type<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.379> chain<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it maybe what kind of type of chain it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.729 
it maybe what kind of type of chain it
was<00:02:11.300> check<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.349> could<00:02:13.470> set<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
was check there and then you could set a

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.790 
was check there and then you could set a
reminder<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.430> okay<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.330> April<00:02:15.930> 10th

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
reminder like okay it's it's April 10th

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.540 
reminder like okay it's it's April 10th
I<00:02:17.239> want<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.360> look<00:02:18.480> at<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.840> again<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.920> three

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
I want to look at this again in in three

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.059 
I want to look at this again in in three
months<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.560> enter<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:26.480> reminder<00:02:27.480> date
