00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello with you my ginger hand 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.460
 panda and not usually for us video we 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.170
 decided to speculate on one very 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.969
 topic that interests us 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.519
 recently in the VKontakte group I posted 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 the picture on which was depicted 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.170
 blonde and signature that start 50 king 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.840
 of gray and twilight stood next 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 the brunette which listed all 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.189
 classic and 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.090
 Russian and foreign and there was a reasonable 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.239
 the question is whether the brunette thinks herself higher 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 than the blonde next door in the picture and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.649
 it gave me an idea about 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.320
 really many people think 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.510
 consider themselves above non-reading 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 but many who read only 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 classic or respected literature in the world 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 considers himself head and shoulders above those who 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.910
 reads twilight 50 shades of coelho 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.420
 Dontsova and their ilk and the most interesting 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 what exactly are these works and these authors 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 sound most often 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 if you want to subtly hint that you 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 don't understand anything in sausage cuts 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.970
 and I confess to you honestly one time to me 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 I was ashamed to admit that I read 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.340
 Wings I confessed I read paolo 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 coelho and even more ashamed of me before 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 it became but now I will say that to me 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 many of his works like him 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.820
 I think of them sensible 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 and that they have the essence of the meaning and a lot of things 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 can be made reading the works of paulo 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 coelho 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.700
 about what I read Dontsov probably 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 in general it would be worth keeping quiet but her 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.130
 manifestations read yes this is a work on 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.960
 once read and forgotten and can be through 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 year start reading them again and you even 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.450
 I do not remember what the point is, but in this and 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 the essence of her ironic detectives so that you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 read it disappeared forgot and tomorrow went and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.740
 again took to read this book not because 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.030
 that she carries some kind of high 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.759
 global meaning 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 but because in one single time in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.110
 one sitting you can read and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.780
 take a completely different world from everyone 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 these problems obsession some more 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.720
 issues that we are now 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.149
 just no 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.250
 want to think and who are you now 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.500
 not interested and yet so often happens 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.860
 if I personally if you are on something 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 fix the books you come across 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.580
 relevant and you are just for it and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.010
 pay attention and books twilight 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.220
 and in shades things are a little simpler 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.740
 but still not always worth mentioning 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.380
 that you and them read you never 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.430
 attended such questions I was abducted 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.070
 Often 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.560
 and it's still time to express in the first place 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.720
 I think that if a person reads books 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.620
 it doesn't make it any better or worse 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.070
 other 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.090
 and yes if twilight reads 50 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.660
 Odintsovo shades 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.459
 he doesn't get better or worse than who 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.920
 reads the crime of punishment and war and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.230
 world for example someone scoops his 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.060
 information from books reception any 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.880
 underline any books that are 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.310
 serve their soul someone scoops 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.560
 information from movies from comics from 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.990
 cartoons from life experience at the end 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.360
 ends secondly I will not prevaricate 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.239
 not all books are equally useful 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.060
 but it is only because all the people in the world 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.760
 are on a different wave and to one and 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.019
 the same conclusion we all come by different 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.360
 ways song 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.860
 take for example the works of empire 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.410
 Bernard Werber's Angels 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.019
 a lot of bad and good things said 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.600
 about this book which describes 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.910
 underworld construction tell 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.280
 about angels about soul relocation but personally 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.780
 from my point of view about the same but much 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.170
 more interesting and more pleasant 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.459
 told by authors like Ruiz Coelho 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 bang devi making rhonda bern fresh and all 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.440
 they talked about the same thing only 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.450
 different words somehow differently 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.180
 described came from different sides 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.239
 accentuated in different places but the essence 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.600
 stayed exactly the same and did not work out 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.540
 me with an empire of angels lay on the soul 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.049
 but the less the ideas of Bernard themselves 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.090
 verbera 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.850
 I basically support the poor 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.250
 twilight here for example the second book she is about 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 separation and pain and that this 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.690
 connected about how we all 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.019
 again of course girls but i 'm sure that 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.690
 there are boys about what we think of as 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.389
 we experience how we kill the whole and how 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.430
 think about what a spiritual wound and hole in 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.650
 the heart will never grow over and 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.020
 believe me if you read the second book 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.320
 just being in this state love 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.199
 live without him and i cant un she's gone 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.300
 abandoned left everything I'll go make 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.639
 suicide if a person is in such 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.010
 state then the second book of twilight 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.949
 the saga will take you for the soul as you 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.500
 don't even take off though someone is more interesting and 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.580
 more pleasant to read about these experiences 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.550
 Makklou ubnt run away from Pushkin bought in 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.690
 general to each his own and scream you read 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.880
 sex coelho 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.100
 therefore you are never the essence of war and peace 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.010
 comprehend yes that there you can not even 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.229
 include not very nice and I think 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.690
 that books are fun in 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.630
 the first is immersion in new 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.280
 worlds is plus 1 plus 10 plus a hundred to 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.889
 your life experience 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.620
 if you read the book and made it out 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.810
 some conclusion and not every 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.389
 man draw the same conclusions from 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.940
 the same book have books from 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:29.070
 which is simply impossible to do alone 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.169
 stable output you just read and 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.389
 each time itâ€™s like a new book for 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.340
 me this is alice in wonderland and alice in 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.950
 the looking glass of lewis carroll besides 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.310
 books increase the vocabulary of the reader 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.560
 but this is only if new 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.349
 previously unknown to the reading words 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.389
 so well fit into the context that the essence 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.000
 this word in is understandable in itself either 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.160
 if the reader is watching the links that 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.410
 sometimes in obscure words 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.120
 either then go online and google 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.490
 what was that word for 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.289
 magical still in the book pulls up 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.479
 literacy as visual works 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.060
 memory but unfortunately for today 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.880
 day there are a huge number of books 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.340
 with misprints from a series of not his lom 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.710
 written together and about the presence or 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.870
 lack of soft sign in the word and general 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.889
 I teach in general how not there is the same 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.240
 decorated with zebras 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.150
 also does not exist absolutely 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.669
 ancient opinions but because read and 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.250
 read and generally a personal matter of each 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.500
 human and perhaps ashamed maybe 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.400
 read only 50 shades of gray 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.650
 it's only if you are 12 years old and you are going to 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.419
 public transport and everything seems to be 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.669
 I understand that you should not 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.800
 book 4 12 years and you about how it becomes 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:44.020
 ashamed but it seems like you read well in 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.720
 general you understand the train of thought in general 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.720
 summing up under all of the above I said 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.909
 I think what to read or not to read it. 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.400
 a personal matter of each person and it is not 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.229
 makes someone better or worse just like that 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.479
 same does not make someone better or worse if 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.380
 one person considers recognized in the world 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.659
 literature 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.449
 some very very high divine 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.580
 and someone reads nothing 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.389
 divine as again thinks like 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.310
 would be like the whole world 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.430
 but still the whole world continues to read 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.940
 Do you think that the person reading 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.580
 higher than the one who does not read and count or 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.490
 are you reading classics higher than that 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.919
 who reads supposedly consumer goods and 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.259
 does he really understand nothing in 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.180
 sausage trimmings and whether to be already 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.979
 so categorical we panda with 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.020
 looking forward to your responses 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.000
 I'd like to discuss this 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.500
 about but for now we are talking to you from the panda 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.090
 thank you very much for your attention everyone 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.770
 good day good mood 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.770
 hope to see you soon
