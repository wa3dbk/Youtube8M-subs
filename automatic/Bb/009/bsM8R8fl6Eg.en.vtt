00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:23.000
 today I and my granddaughters that if we are going to 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.030
 prepare some delicious packs and cabbage 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.390
 for these days of oppressive heat that 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.890
 better than preparing lollipops 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.820
 ourselves in our homes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.570
 I'm going to do the strawberries, let's just go 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.310
 to need a few strawberries a little 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.410
 of sugar and water to liquefy strawberries 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.710
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.740
 wash the strawberries well and take them out 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.570
 part of the leaf wash them well because 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 remember that strawberries bring a lot 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.250
 tierrita strawberries is one of the fruits 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:06.850
 that very fast tends to break down 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.990
 it is best to buy your strawberries wash them 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.850
 well dry them well and freeze them and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 we are taking them out as we go 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.000
 needing 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 we're going well we have to get this 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.500
 part of here 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.080
 in this part remove the balls 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.080
 strawberries 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.110
 very fast they spoil 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.030
 and so we go washing the hours 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.640
 tremendous our plans of a heart 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.939
 in the blender jar can we go 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:57.369
 adding the strawberries the amount of 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:00.799
 strawberries that we need is a little more than 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.819
 half a glass of the blender but if 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:08.259
 you add more strawberries this juice goes 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.810
 to come out thicker and when it comes to 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.420
 refrigerate the juices have to be like that 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.569
 so that the taste is more pleasant and not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.470
 you feel so much ice you can 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.459
 sweeten with sugar or honey 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.530
 that depends on the taste of each person 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.360
 Of course, it's healthier to sweeten it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.660
 with honey 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.050
 let's add liquid in this case I 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.000
 I'm using distilled water water 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.880
 filter water 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.580
 but if you use the milk of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:49.320
 gallon or with evaporated milk that comes out 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.470
 better I assure you that these basic or 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.010
 pacifiers are going to be the charm of your 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.430
 good kids now we just have to liquefy 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.100
 well this preparation let's try 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.890
 liquefy it but do not get too 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 the fruit because it's rich when you're 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.420
 sucking the basic and find the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.420
 bits of strawberries there 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.190
 also it lacks some strawberries not 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.190
 I want it to come out very watery 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.020
 that you have to have flavor to flower history 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.150
 it's very nice of everything we're going to 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.150
 see with a little more 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.260
 you want to help me and then it's worth when 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.090
 I do your put the little sticks ok 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.090

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:34.889

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.960
