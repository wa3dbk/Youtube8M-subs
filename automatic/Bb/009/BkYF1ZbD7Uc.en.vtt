 ah ah ah 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.230
 Hi, I 'm an elano hacker from the site. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.550
 cordelistas who only invited two flavors 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.290
 of Sugar Loaf Week 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 today the dish that we are going to make is a 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.670
 my room with basil 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.770
 has already thought about including red meat in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.869
 Your Christmas dinner our recipe today 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.000
 this is precisely why it is a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.070
 suggestion that will make a difference in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.590
 Your party with guests, let's go to the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:42.440
 Ingredients fresh basil one piece 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:48.210
 of a mile clean shoyu oregano oil 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.269
 pepper finger olive oil garlic salt and 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.729
 pepper today, mine that we 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.760
 let's use this piece here already well 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.409
 clean in case you arrive in the supermarket and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.330
 see that your piece is a bit 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.640
 more fat just ask for the smell 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.460
 because it makes a lot of difference in the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.440
 dish flavor 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.210
 The first step in revenue is to prepare the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.150
 sauce that goes in our house 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.299
 I'll start getting our finger pepper 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.240
 gal to avoid burning is that it is 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.500
 The seed ends up causing 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.500
 eyes on the nose 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 just be careful not to touch 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.980
 in seeds 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.320
 so if you have gloves or even 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.170
 a napkin you can use to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.710
 help with this task or else it 's just 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 enough careful cutting so that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 hands do not touch the inside of the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.550
 chili 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:52.400
 now it 's time to stay jerican 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:00.850
 mix all the seasonings starting 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:09.710
 for the first time he dog oregano and salt 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:15.020
 shoyu oil pepper to taste 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.550
 just mix it with sauce ready it's time to 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.550
 season beef on both sides 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.000
 now it's time to take the meat to the 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.690
 oven that will already be preheated to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.690
 180 degrees 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.390
 Let's throw our mine for a 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 hour 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.360
 After an hour we'll take the paper. 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.100
 aluminum and back with the meat to the oven 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:57.410
 for another 30 minutes until well 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.390
 golden the speech of the 30 minutes we 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.280
 Let's leave the house resting because 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 this will make it even more juicy 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.940
 meanwhile we'll last the garlic 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.940
 to finish our term 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.720
 the time has come to finalize the 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.970
 dish 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.430
 we'll get to our meat with the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.519
 garlic and olive oil loved 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.379
 When it comes to serving mine, it matters. 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.359
 to take it in the opposite direction of the 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.359
 fiber so it gets softer 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.569
 our follow-up suggestions are 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.569
 exclusive potatoes and pods 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.499
