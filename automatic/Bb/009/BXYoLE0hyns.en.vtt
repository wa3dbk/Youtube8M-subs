00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.230
 good kids and let's try we're 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.940
 here in a new call of duty video 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.500
 black ops 2 for the nuclear series 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 with all the weapons and this time it's our turn 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.100
 the boy although he is one of the last 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.199
 rifles since we are apart from this 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.730
 then we would stay in the double PDV and if 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.800
 I'm not wrong the peacekeeper and that's it 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.199
 so then this is a weapon that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.029
 I would say that she is the only one I hate 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.650
 Chilean is that he hates it but if he had 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.849
 that discard some would discard this 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.130
 which is the one I like the least 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.599
 say it and the hardest to get the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.180
 nuclear by difference so I os 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.500
 I would appreciate your like in this video 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.790
 since it is something that costs a lot and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.410
 Well here he has brought it for all 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.600
 you are good on the map of 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.340
 jacket that is a map so suitable for 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.660
 this weapon we could say and well then 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.160
 The advantages that I have are the same as 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.140
 you will have seen it at the beginning 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 of the accessories video I wear the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.800
 fire selector to shoot 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.879
 automatic you already know what good and if not 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.739
 you know, because this weapon is 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.690
 semiautomatic that is going to bursts 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.390
 so then I put the selector 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.250
 I do not use it always worth small maps what 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.289
 usually wear long and maps for only 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.330
 put it without selector since bursts 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.310
 it kills more far and all that but 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.490
 I do not think it has a selector and a long barrel 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.280
 if I'm not wrong then good 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.659
 in this video I will not be too 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.159
 technical and such I'll talk a little bit 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.110
 about the new call of duty since I have not 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.600
 spoken nothing so far and good 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.189
 Well, it's going to come out practically 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.049
 there is a month and so we can 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.610
 have the game to play it and such and 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.439
 Well, I'll give you my impressions 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.149
 that I think the game and all that I'm going to 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.470
 leave everything that is the nuclear background 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.299
 first of all what I want is that 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.710
 you make me apart from what I'm going 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.060
 to comment and I'll say in the video 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.619
 Well for the comments your opinion 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.390
 about the new call of duty waiting 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.700
 you know that there is much controversy with 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.170
 of the super jumps the exo suit and everything 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.940
 that and well I wanted to talk a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.950
 little bit about it first tell you that 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 I was watching videos and just my 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 first impressions are pretty good 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.979
 that is, the game is very colorful at least 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.409
 watching it on video is pretty showy 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.270
 for example is something that is I would say that 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.729
 the opposite of fate because the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.170
 destiny is a game that is very good at 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.360
 I like it a lot, it has a lot of fun 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.130
 playing it but it is not so colorful 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.330
 I mean I admit that I do not 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.920
 I would go to YouTube to watch videos of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.619
 destiny although I liked the game a lot 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 because it really is not attractive to the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.590
 seen at least for me I do not want 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.600
 say that it is not colorful but it is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.240
 less showy than call of duty by 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.560
 example then this one do not vote them 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.720
 I said very colorful and I like it very much 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.820
 see it and well then watch a video and you what 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.710
 nice maps how beautiful everything and 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.420
 as well as with that pretty suit 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.970
 faster because it 's more frantic and I 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.590
 I see faster and I do not know is enough 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.500
 colorful magician I really like the color 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 all that at that point because that is 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.220
 pretty good especially because for 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.010
 youtuber and all that or for youtube 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.650
 say that this point goes is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.080
 quite beautiful and good because about it is 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.240
 I brought it and such I think it will keep 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.010
 will continue to be a call of duty voucher 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.710
 there are not many people who say with that already 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.720
 Well, it's not a call of duty, it's something else 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.040
 similar but I think that yes 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.530
 maintains what is the essence of the call 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.180
 of duty only you run more and jump more 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.640
 but everything else is exactly the same 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.760
 is worth a lot of controversy with that I 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.770
 I've always defended that it's not going 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.360
 much change that it is not not that 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.980
 I had neither in favor nor against that 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.050
 I really wore it because I said to see what 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.430
 it comes out but I do not think that when I've seen 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.020
 the videos and all that is like destiny 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.460
 and for example with the super jumps 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.410
 it really is not that they change much 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.360
 dynamics of the game at the end is the same 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.710
 no but simply because they jump more 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.240
 they run more than I think the only thing 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.430
 is going to give that to the game is 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.080
 it's going to be more frantic faster 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.280
 more movement than the truth that are my 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.960
 and what I like, I do not think I can 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.810
 do the a little bit more accelerated and a 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.100
 little bit more moved this is good if not 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.320
 nothing happens and I'm going to have the game 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.940
 this new call of duty quite a few days 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.530
 before, it's worth two weeks before that 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.570
 that soon I will have what 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890
 I'll be able to try the online I suppose 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.030
 It will not be activated but good as I can 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.650
 try a little bit like that above and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.940
 tell you what I think and well then 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.920
 truth is that I really want to 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.480
 try it because as I said I'm attracted 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.880
 much the videos that I have seen what has 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.630
 commented people and the truth is that 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.920
 They generally have good impressions 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.600
 those who have been able to prove it 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.730
 evidently until everyone 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.470
 let's have in our house and let's be 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.960
 playing a week we are not going to 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.390
 decant to see if it is good or bad or 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.650
 that you have to check each one and good 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.510
 Well, we need at least a week 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.950
 or two already saying is worth this game is worth this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.200
 game is not worth that is fine in this 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.880
 game has failures this game does not 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.280
 like because it is for example colostrum 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.690
 ticos lasted me half a day, so 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.760
 it lasted half a day because I did not like it 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.270
 the way to kill the way to move does not 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.070
 I know the maps that I do not like that not without 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.470
 But the call of duty black ops' 2 is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.430
 a game very well done and more showy or 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.900
 is that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.600
 you simply put a job of 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.430
 soft and call of duty ghosts and is 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.350
 which is much more colorful to see the call 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 of duty black auto I do not know why the 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.789
 way to kill by colors 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.740
 by hache or by be is that I do not know I do not have 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.060
 no idea but it's a lot more showy and 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.400
 quite more playable for example white 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.860
 is that it is a very good game because 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.449
 I just have a failure, or it's a mistake 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.889
 on a large scale for example model of 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.960
 poster was a good modern warfare game 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.419
 3 the game that I liked but had 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.310
 failures like the hand of the one hand that if not 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.740
 I know what last battle all that is something 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.970
 that I could a little the game however 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.620
 in whites 2 because if in the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.690
 machine guns are sitting a bit and 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.030
 but it has nothing so say 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.160
 super playing the game is worth it is 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 a very balanced game by removing the 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.820
 the machine guns that are mutated and 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.410
 that you can not continue playing today in 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.509
 day is not that you have much presence of 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.949
 hacker and urcos is pretty good and it's 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.539
 a game that I like I hope that 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.289
 come out something quite like white 2 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.969
 and from what I've seen 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.439
 it seems worth it calls me a lot the 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.360
 attention what worries me is that it 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.399
 kills a few bullets less according to 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.069
 is saying that it kills almost communicates 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:33.080
 the witnesses a little less and good 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.550
 Well, the truth is that in Carlos I say 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.740
 it kills very fast for my liking to me 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.939
 like more in the style of black up 2 and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.439
 well then let's hope that does not 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.909
 affect a lot we will see in the end if 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.169
 retouch nor such because everything they have 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.270
 taken so far have said that it is not 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.979
 nothing fixed but I from my point of 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.569
 I see it quite attractive, I think 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.119
 It can be very novel what injury 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.770
 suit without changing the scheme and how is 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:53.599
 call of duty that I have seen it and I say 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.430
 is that it is call of duty or is it still 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.919
 being the same as always and I think 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.990
 that is good and at the same time the novelty 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.270
 It can also be good or I want to 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.830
 say that I like caló tutti like 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.409
 it's obviously I like that they put in 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.389
 innovations but keep your style 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.680
 because that's why for me it's the best 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.729
 the shooter and all that is always the one 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.050
 I liked it more then I like that 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.729
 it's a call of duty but they put 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.760
 news then I think it is 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.040
 pretty good because people always 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.770
 and of news but if they put new features 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.000
 then he complains or is not clarified or 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.950
 be I believe that people do not know what 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.990
 who wants good then let's leave 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.580
 we are going to test if it is perfect 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.260
 and if not then we will have time to 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.550
 complain I think so nothing 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.960

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.190
 liked and good to say for the 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.930
 comments all your opinion I 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.520
 I'm looking forward to trying it and nothing to burst 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.700
 with the life favorites and even the 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.700

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.169
