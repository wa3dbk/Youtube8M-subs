00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 And then folks, I 'm here in or on this one. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 I'll show you a guide to the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 conquest of the dragon 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 this achievement is part of the glory of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 adventurer of the cataclysm and should be 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.180
 made during the fight against the chiefs 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.400
 worth one and will have lyon in the raid bastion of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 twilight to the conquest of that county 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.180
 defeat the bosses after killing six 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 twilight minions in the kingdom 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 in this fight will not be 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.199
 face two bosses simultaneously and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 they have a shared life 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.820
 the strategy that emerges for the conquest 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 is the following begins the fight with the bosses 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 and lowers their lives but not the enamel 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.329
 still be defensive and wait until the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.800
 moment you will have not start to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 work skill destruction 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.600
 which may remind you a little 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.620
 then put in your focus and be 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 patient 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.899
 as it begins to launch the destruction 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 a boyce vortex will appear on the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 indicating the area of impact of the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 skill and you should position yourself 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 within that strong that the impact of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 ability will make players 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 within the wocs are transferred to the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 twilight kingdom in this realm you will see 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 countless works that will do damage 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 so avoid touching them but if you go 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.670
 maximum level the damage shall not be 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.409
 problem in here you should 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 look for these creatures that are 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.939
 dusk demon calls them 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.640
 appear and disappear from time to time 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.100
 and you must seek and kill six of them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.829
 for conquest but it may be a bit 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.390
 hard to find quickly 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 so if you prefer you can do it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 a machine like that of the target of Moorish 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.680
 in the twilight that will allow you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 select any such creature 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.640
 to be alive at the moment and to stay 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.280
 Even easier you can not stay in the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.710
 magnifying glass next to your mini map and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 to show your target so whenever 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.530
 You're with the twilight demon. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.210
 on your target 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.670
 you can see his location in the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 your mini map here at this location you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.560
 You will also find some portals 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.790
 this is what if clicked on you are from 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
 twilight kingdom 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.860
 so watch out after killing at least six 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.530
 twilight demons kill the bosses 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.900
 usually and the achievement should be your 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.680
 and that's it I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.680
 to the next
