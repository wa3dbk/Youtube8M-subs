the GTA 5 police say I of the police has

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.650 
the GTA 5 police say I of the police has
improved<00:00:44.870> drastically<00:00:45.589> so<00:00:46.010> it<00:00:46.730> will<00:00:46.940> be<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.089> bit

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
improved drastically so it will be a bit

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.259 
improved drastically so it will be a bit
harder<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.079> survive<00:00:48.769> and<00:00:49.010> escape<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.699> it'll

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
harder to survive and escape and it'll

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.150 
harder to survive and escape and it'll
definitely<00:00:50.449> be<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.719> lot<00:00:50.960> harder<00:00:51.140> if<00:00:51.320> you're<00:00:51.769> new

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
definitely be a lot harder if you're new

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.849 
definitely be a lot harder if you're new
to<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.460> game<00:00:52.670> just<00:00:53.329> because<00:00:53.629> they<00:00:54.109> increase

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
to the game just because they increase

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.919 
to the game just because they increase
the<00:00:55.070> difficulty<00:00:55.489> just<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.449> make<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.629> more

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
the difficulty just to make it more

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.700 
the difficulty just to make it more
realistic<00:00:57.379> in<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:58.659> just<00:00:59.659> overall<00:01:00.079> harder<00:01:00.469> more

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
realistic in I just overall harder more

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.160 
realistic in I just overall harder more

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
realistic at all in hiding in like say

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.900 
realistic at all in hiding in like say
in<00:01:24.140> a<00:01:24.230> dumpster<00:01:24.620> would<00:01:25.280> not<00:01:25.460> help<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.790> get

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
all you have to do is you have to get

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.320 
all you have to do is you have to get
out<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.130> line<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.340> sight<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.000> cops

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
which obviously is going to be much

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.290 
which obviously is going to be much
harder<00:03:28.040> once<00:03:28.310> there's<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.640> bunch<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.090> cops

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
harder once there's a bunch of cops

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300 
harder once there's a bunch of cops
coming<00:03:29.600> after<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:29.959> like<00:03:30.290> things<00:03:31.130> like

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the helicopter can shine a light on you

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.680
