00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
also the beginnings of our sewing

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.519 
also the beginnings of our sewing
journey<00:00:19.330> so<00:00:19.570> first<00:00:19.779> of<00:00:19.990> all<00:00:20.080> we<00:00:20.140> have<00:00:20.380> our

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
journey so first of all we have our

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.089 
journey so first of all we have our
stitching<00:00:21.010> guide<00:00:21.220> here<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.410> button<00:00:23.890> is

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
stitching guide here and this button is

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.780 
stitching guide here and this button is
our<00:00:24.279> stitch<00:00:24.640> selector<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.860> one<00:00:27.130> determines

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
our stitch selector this one determines

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.569 
our stitch selector this one determines
the<00:00:28.000> length<00:00:28.300> of<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:29.079> stitch<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.739> we<00:00:30.400> also

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
the length of the stitch and we also

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.560 
the length of the stitch and we also
have<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> width<00:00:31.450> selector<00:00:32.230> at<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.590> top<00:00:32.860> here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
have a width selector at the top here

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.330 
have a width selector at the top here
now<00:00:34.570> obviously<00:00:34.720> this<00:00:35.290> particular<00:00:35.649> guide<00:00:36.070> is

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
now obviously this particular guide is

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.420 
now obviously this particular guide is
very<00:00:36.610> good<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.470> think<00:00:38.769> it's<00:00:38.920> much<00:00:39.129> better

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
very good but I think it's much better

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.450 
very good but I think it's much better
if<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:40.030> first<00:00:40.899> of<00:00:41.140> all<00:00:41.289> start<00:00:41.680> stitching<00:00:42.010> on

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
if you first of all start stitching on

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.959 
if you first of all start stitching on
to<00:00:42.789> some<00:00:42.969> fabric<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:45.370> I'm<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:45.579> going<00:00:45.699> to<00:00:45.760> show

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
to some fabric so I'm just going to show

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.930 
to some fabric so I'm just going to show
you<00:00:46.030> our<00:00:46.269> little<00:00:46.510> section<00:00:46.929> I've<00:00:47.109> done<00:00:47.320> here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you our little section I've done here

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.610 
you our little section I've done here
this<00:00:48.940> was<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.179> guide<00:00:49.539> so<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:49.870> could<00:00:50.109> get<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.289> see

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
this was a guide so I could get to see

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.619 
this was a guide so I could get to see
what<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:50.920> really<00:00:51.129> looks<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:51.550> on<00:00:51.879> material<00:00:52.480> as

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
what it really looks like on material as

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.110 
what it really looks like on material as
you'll<00:00:53.289> notice<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.769> have<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:53.980> number<00:00:54.370> I've

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you'll notice I have a number I've

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.819 
you'll notice I have a number I've
numbered<00:00:55.570> at<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.750> top<00:00:55.960> but<00:00:56.559> I've<00:00:56.679> also

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
numbered at the top but I've also

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.939 
numbered at the top but I've also
numbered<00:00:57.550> down<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.390> side<00:00:58.629> now<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.679> reason

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
numbered down the side now the reason

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.860 
numbered down the side now the reason
I've<00:01:00.190> numbered<00:01:00.550> down<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.879> side<00:01:01.149> as<00:01:01.359> well<00:01:01.539> is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
I've numbered down the side as well is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.630 
I've numbered down the side as well is
because<00:01:02.050> this<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.559> in<00:01:02.710> reference<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.519> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
because this is in reference to the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
because this is in reference to the
stitch<00:01:03.969> length<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.530> one<00:01:06.310> obviously<00:01:06.820> is

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
stitch length so one obviously is

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.990 
stitch length so one obviously is
referencing<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.530> one<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.430> machine<00:01:09.820> and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
referencing to one on the machine and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.230 
referencing to one on the machine and
that<00:01:10.090> way<00:01:10.870> I<00:01:10.900> can<00:01:11.290> really<00:01:11.560> get<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.220> see<00:01:12.550> what

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
that way I can really get to see what

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.180 
that way I can really get to see what
all<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.660> different<00:01:13.690> stitches<00:01:14.290> are<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.860> and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
all the different stitches are like and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.400 
all the different stitches are like and
also<00:01:15.970> what<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.240> different<00:01:16.570> stitch<00:01:16.810> length<00:01:17.140> I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
also what the different stitch length I

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.410 
also what the different stitch length I
like<00:01:18.160> as<00:01:18.370> well<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.670> also<00:01:21.820> have<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.150> little

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
like as well we also have a little

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.960 
like as well we also have a little
section<00:01:23.260> here<00:01:23.320> which<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:24.460> for<00:01:24.640> stretch

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
section here which is for stretch

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.560 
section here which is for stretch

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
to sewing there were going to be so many

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.120 
to sewing there were going to be so many
different<00:01:37.420> things<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.960> learn<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.800> highly

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130
