00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.759
 so an unknown project 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.989
 suddenly had time to win wide 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:17.820
 spectrum 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 first game a fatal day studio with 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.200
 grown out of simple student work 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.240
 already on saw cut win hearts 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 tens of thousands of players around the world 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640
 unique idea as it usually happens 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.569
 didn't let down 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.179
 We offer you a video review 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.179
 glued jock find work 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 our main occupation will be nothing 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.290
 other than the salvation of the world 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.360
 like that without any pathos of any style 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.780
 the game is penetrated through gasoline 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 and links to various creations 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.870
 cinema gaming industry 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 literature is about the offense phenomenon 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.310
 everyday 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.660
 not here in the relay of these dialogues 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.300
 but yakuninâ€™s nuts are created its atmosphere 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.650
 remembered immediately and permanently 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.720
 passengers played can not be called 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 swirling it essentially completely 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.850
 lines 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.770
 however the wagons of it are on 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.810
 enough height despite all 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.530
 Narago go crazy 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.270
 will happen 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.720
 the basis of the boy is her fighting 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.110
 the system here has no inventory in wide 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 understanding of the word 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.700
 arm we can only one kind 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.979
 physical and one kind of magical 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.060
 weapons magical weapons 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600
 every possible lane artistic all about 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.619
 than you can firmly bang 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.190
 ravine 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.780
 I start the source of blades and ending 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 barish flaming fingers 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.000
 or even some 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.659
 crazy devices like 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.620
 machine gun m 60 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.460
 in the game as unnecessary also 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.960
 missing skill and pumping 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.820
 what's the point of the game is very simple 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.240
 she is flooded with a long practice 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.890
 how we will kill depends only on your 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.140
 fantasy 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.510
 we will do this by 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.549
 numerous spells 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.379
 we have to get a lot 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.379
 wake up posters with a hail of lightning 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.049
 throw stones at him 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.139
 nominate freeze 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.799
 fence from native walls 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.620
 click meteor shower 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.689
 or invoke a black hole 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.869
 this is perhaps the tenth part of what 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.879
 allowed us to be up time 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.929
 the idea is surprisingly simple 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.889
 the game uses several keys 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.439
 keyboard 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.040
 each of them is assigned to either 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.790
 certain magical element like 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.219
 for example fire and water ice electricity 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.969
 or is anything at all to blame 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.329
 pressing the appropriate 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.799
 document we add it unlikely constituents 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.439
 our future spells 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.849
 at any time filling out 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.790
 a certain number of cells we 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.409
 can we have our regular freedom 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.609
 Anniversary 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.829
 we will explain 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.249
 one item will be added 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.199
 electricity we get small 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.579
 pskov 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.469
 but filling the row all the way we will free 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.759
 loose a whole sheaf of sparks 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.859
 combining submariners from the ground 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.829
 and we will get pitch already 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.889
 cocktail of magical considered 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.529
 water will give you a point and a little rain 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.879
 and if they replace the abortion system 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.499
 flame in waiting for all enemies 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.559
 and so on 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.309
 all spells are absolutely 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.019
 don't try to be logical 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.009
 use the mole without being from head to toe 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.229
 retired so short and himself a group 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.619
 but the look of a crowd of enemies and let it go 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.339
 discharge is a nice thing 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.529
 seriously heated by the fact that 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:42.469
 the opponent behave differently often 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.619
 I have to think too hard 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.329
 to understand which approach should be 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.659
 choose to destroy 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.900
 especially food courts bastards or whole 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.559
 crowds of such bastards 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.149
 Often this helps a special 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.749
 combinations with the name given to itself so 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.099
 called boy letter 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.289
 they are written in the book which we find by 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.289
 the course of the game is a great help 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.349
 despite its bright style in the arena to 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.959
 games are very difficult 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.499
 technically the game can pass the time with a point in 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.219
 reality make it very, very 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.759
 not easy for this exists 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.590
 cooperative mode 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.320
 cooperative passing in this 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.340
 the game brings no less fun than how about 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.010
 unpaid fund in the first days after 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.210
 release 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.340
 There are only two modes of company and 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.199
 arena 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.830
 in the first team of four people 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.689
 goes through the plot twists and turns 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.819
 in the second quarter, the price will rise as 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.669
 possible more time 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.099
 against the oncoming monster port 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.610
 being a debut project 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.639
 magic they escaped some annoying 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 deficiencies associated with technical 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.849
 network performance far far from 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.210
 perfection multiplayer 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.310
 legal frets of games and sometimes crashes 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.750
 wired and someone else completely refused 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.430
 work 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.340
 graphic design 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.219
 wonderful 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.869
 but absolutely not relevant 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:04:59.849
 its unreasonably high system 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.029
 requirements of similar developers 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:03.999
 did not expect such a popularity of the game 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.279
 but then rushed to rivet patches 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.689
 while it is worth noting they do it very 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.309
 successfully the game has great potential 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.469
 for development you can almost certainly 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.329
 to say that talent is either 

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:17.299
 numerous in vain 

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:18.109
 technical flaws 

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.109
 coping pretty quickly 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:23.349
 magic can be recommended 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.179
 because everybody here is essentially no 

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:28.899
 profile or genre tied game 

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.769
 unique approach to all and this 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:32.939
 undoubted plus will call even greater 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:34.620
 success in the future 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.240
 good luck and see you at the entrance round rub
