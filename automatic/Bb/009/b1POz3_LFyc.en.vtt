00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
going to take a look at the Zeppelin

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.030 
going to take a look at the Zeppelin
deep<00:00:05.730> parabolic<00:00:06.509> from<00:00:07.049> Westcott<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.830> is

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
deep parabolic from Westcott it is

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.830 
deep parabolic from Westcott it is
quickly<00:00:08.340> becoming<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.360> favorite

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
quickly becoming one of my favorite

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.220 
quickly becoming one of my favorite
modifiers<00:00:14.570> so<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> take<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> look

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
modifiers so we're going to take a look

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.779 
modifiers so we're going to take a look
at<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> couple<00:00:16.710> different<00:00:17.070> ways<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.430> mount

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
at a couple different ways you can mount

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.490 
at a couple different ways you can mount
your<00:00:18.210> light<00:00:18.390> source<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> Zeppelin<00:00:19.350> as

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
your light source to the Zeppelin as

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.439 
your light source to the Zeppelin as
well<00:00:20.130> as<00:00:20.279> different<00:00:20.580> light<00:00:20.730> patterns<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
well as different light patterns and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.630 
well as different light patterns and
qualities<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> light<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.609> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
qualities of light I can do a lot of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.519 
qualities of light I can do a lot of
different<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.960> create

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
different things with this I can create

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
different things with this I can create
soft<00:00:25.890> light<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.910> create<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> hard

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
soft light with it I can create a hard

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.540 
soft light with it I can create a hard
light<00:00:27.660> edge<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
light edge with it and I do a lot of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.540 
light edge with it and I do a lot of
traveling<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:29.970> I'd<00:00:30.150> rather<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.539> one

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
traveling so I'd rather have one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.650 
traveling so I'd rather have one
modifier<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> lot

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
modifier with me that I can do a lot

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
modifier with me that I can do a lot
with<00:00:33.719> than<00:00:34.290> several<00:00:34.920> modifiers<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
with than several modifiers and this

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170 
with than several modifiers and this
fills<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.480> bill<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.980> Zeppelin<00:00:38.489> gives

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
fills that bill this the Zeppelin gives

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.630 
fills that bill this the Zeppelin gives
me<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> options<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.230> need<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> get

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
me the options that I need when I get

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520 
me the options that I need when I get
into<00:00:41.820> certain<00:00:42.149> circumstances<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:42.989> location

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
into certain circumstances on location

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
into certain circumstances on location
the<00:00:44.370> Zeppelin<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.390> bunch<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the Zeppelin we can use a bunch of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
the Zeppelin we can use a bunch of
different<00:00:46.170> ways<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
different ways we can use it as a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
different ways we can use it as a
traditional<00:00:47.550> softbox<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> mount<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
traditional softbox where you mount the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.060 
traditional softbox where you mount the
your<00:00:50.550> light<00:00:50.730> source<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:52.070> facing

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your light source on the back facing

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
your light source on the back facing
forward<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.110> configuration

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
forward so in that in that configuration

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.069 
forward so in that in that configuration
what<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.120> would<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:57.420> an<00:00:57.629> internal

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
what we do is we would use an internal

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
what we do is we would use an internal
baffle<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.829> order<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.250> spread<00:00:59.579> out<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.850> light

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
baffle in order to spread out that light

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
baffle in order to spread out that light
so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> hot<00:01:00.780> center<00:01:01.170> center

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so you don't have a hot center center

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
so you don't have a hot center center
spot<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:02.399> we'd<00:01:02.550> use<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.940> front<00:01:03.239> panel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
spot and then we'd use the front panel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
spot and then we'd use the front panel
to<00:01:03.989> diffuse<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> light<00:01:04.619> evenly<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:06.060> our

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
to diffuse the light evenly for our

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270 
to diffuse the light evenly for our
subject<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.960> other<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> optimal<00:01:08.130> way

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
subject the other way in the optimal way

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
subject the other way in the optimal way
and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.390> doing<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.080> using<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and the way I like doing it is using the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
and the way I like doing it is using the
Zeppelin<00:01:11.189> support<00:01:11.820> arm<00:01:12.060> where<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.170> mount<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
Zeppelin support arm where you mount the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
Zeppelin support arm where you mount the
light<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> end<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> arm

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
light actually on the end of the arm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
light actually on the end of the arm
facing<00:01:15.750> towards<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.009> Zeppelin

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
facing towards the back of the Zeppelin

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.050 
facing towards the back of the Zeppelin
okay<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.509> does<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.049> allows<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
okay what this does it allows you to get

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.080 
okay what this does it allows you to get
maximum<00:01:21.630> reflectance<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.009> inside<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
maximum reflectance on the inside you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
maximum reflectance on the inside you
don't<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.479> any<00:01:24.780> hot<00:01:25.290> spot<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.159> would

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
don't have any hot spot you would

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
don't have any hot spot you would
actually<00:01:26.490> use<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.570> front<00:01:27.869> panel<00:01:28.350> alone<00:01:28.979> no

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actually use the front panel alone no

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.210 
actually use the front panel alone no
internal<00:01:29.670> baffle<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:31.020> an

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
internal baffle and you would get an

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.969 
internal baffle and you would get an
extremely<00:01:32.220> smooth<00:01:33.180> even<00:01:33.960> light<00:01:34.439> throughout

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
extremely smooth even light throughout

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
extremely smooth even light throughout
the<00:01:35.130> whole<00:01:35.280> front<00:01:35.579> panel<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:36.450> myself<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.049> like

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the whole front panel for myself I like

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.859 
the whole front panel for myself I like
using<00:01:37.710> no<00:01:38.220> pan<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> no<00:01:38.790> diffusion<00:01:39.270> whatsoever

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
using no pan and no diffusion whatsoever

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.859 
using no pan and no diffusion whatsoever
so<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:41.070> face<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.610> light<00:01:42.180> source<00:01:42.390> towards<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so we face that light source towards the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
so we face that light source towards the
back<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> box<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> nice<00:01:44.700> even

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
back of the box we get a nice even

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
back of the box we get a nice even
reflectance<00:01:45.930> throughout<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> box<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> we're

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
reflectance throughout the box and we're

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
reflectance throughout the box and we're
able<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.369> focus<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> quality<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.350> light

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
able to focus it to the quality of light

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.969 
able to focus it to the quality of light
that<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.890> want<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.939> my<00:01:51.090> images<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.680> gives

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that I want in my images and this gives

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
that I want in my images and this gives
me<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.189> nice<00:01:53.520> even<00:01:53.850> light<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.600> harder

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
me a nice even light but it's a harder

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
me a nice even light but it's a harder
edge<00:01:54.960> light<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> does<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
edge light and what that does is it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.230 
edge light and what that does is it
helps<00:01:56.640> me<00:01:56.790> create<00:01:57.060> contrast<00:01:57.770> texture<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
helps me create contrast texture and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
helps me create contrast texture and
better<00:02:00.240> color<00:02:00.540> saturation<00:02:01.140> okay<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
better color saturation okay and I like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
better color saturation okay and I like
the<00:02:02.460> specularity<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.719> which<00:02:04.649> gives

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the specularity that you get which gives

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.920 
the specularity that you get which gives
me<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.250> dimension<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.090> images<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.689> my

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
me more dimension to my images into my

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.580 
me more dimension to my images into my
subject<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.750> flood<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> spot

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
subject we can actually flood and spot

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.040 
subject we can actually flood and spot
this<00:02:11.430> particular<00:02:11.849> modifier

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
this particular modifier

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.380 
this particular modifier
to<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> type<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> light<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.850> quality<00:02:15.300> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
to the type of light the quality of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.660 
to the type of light the quality of
light<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.660> we're<00:02:15.840> looking<00:02:16.080> for<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.520> is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
light that we're looking for so this is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.310 
light that we're looking for so this is
really<00:02:18.240> important<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> whole

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
really important and that's the whole

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.100 
really important and that's the whole
purpose<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:20.010> using<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.970> deep<00:02:21.480> parabolic

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
purpose of using a deep parabolic

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.220 
purpose of using a deep parabolic
because<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> allows<00:02:23.550> us<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.910> manipulate<00:02:24.600> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
because it allows us to manipulate that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.070 
because it allows us to manipulate that
light<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.980> create<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.760> particular<00:02:27.330> type<00:02:28.050> of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
light to create a particular type of

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.020 
light to create a particular type of
quality<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.310> can't<00:02:29.550> get<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.850> any

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
quality that you can't get with any

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200 
quality that you can't get with any
other<00:02:30.240> modifier<00:02:30.950> it's<00:02:31.950> extremely<00:02:32.760> important

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
other modifier it's extremely important

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.910 
other modifier it's extremely important
that<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.870> something<00:02:34.290> like<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> support

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that we have something like a support

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.880 
that we have something like a support
arm<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.520> allow<00:02:35.760> us<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> do<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.500> beauty

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
arm to allow us to do that so the beauty

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
arm to allow us to do that so the beauty
of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.310> mounting<00:02:38.670> arm<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.420> simply<00:02:39.930> we're<00:02:40.440> able

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
of the mounting arm is simply we're able

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.600 
of the mounting arm is simply we're able
to<00:02:41.070> zoom<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.180> light<00:02:42.810> pattern<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.310> out

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
to zoom this light pattern in and out

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.940 
to zoom this light pattern in and out
so<00:02:44.760> essentially<00:02:45.120> flooding<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.410> spotting

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so essentially flooding it or spotting

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.270 
so essentially flooding it or spotting
it<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:48.180> allows<00:02:48.360> us<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.720> change<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.560> quality

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it this allows us to change the quality

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
it this allows us to change the quality
of<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.640> light<00:02:50.880> immensely<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.750> mean<00:02:52.020> it's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
of that light immensely I mean it's

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.220 
of that light immensely I mean it's
incredible<00:02:52.800> how<00:02:53.460> much<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.820> changes<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.930> you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
incredible how much it changes as you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.200 
incredible how much it changes as you
can<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:55.710> now<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> full<00:02:56.760> spot

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
can see right now this is a full spot

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.900 
can see right now this is a full spot
okay<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.190> edge<00:02:59.460> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
okay so you can see on this edge the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.570 
okay so you can see on this edge the
edge<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.240> light<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:01.310> very<00:03:02.310> quick

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
edge of the light a very very quick

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.850 
edge of the light a very very quick
fall-off<00:03:03.180> we<00:03:03.630> have<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> very<00:03:04.110> tight<00:03:04.350> edge<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
fall-off we have a very tight edge on

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.180 
fall-off we have a very tight edge on
that<00:03:04.890> light<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:06.150> we<00:03:06.330> go<00:03:06.480> over<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that light if we go over to the the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.350 
that light if we go over to the the
mounting<00:03:09.150> arm<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.990> we<00:03:10.380> slide<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.830> forward

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
mounting arm and we slide that forward

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.990 
mounting arm and we slide that forward
what<00:03:12.360> we're<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.660> see<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.410> gradual

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
what we're going to see is a gradual

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.580 
what we're going to see is a gradual
flooding<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.210> light<00:03:15.480> okay<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
flooding of the light okay and the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.430 
flooding of the light okay and the
further<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.890> go<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.160> further<00:03:17.730> floods<00:03:18.440> now

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
further we go the further floods now

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.460 
further we go the further floods now
remember<00:03:19.830> our<00:03:19.980> light<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.940> facing<00:03:21.930> towards<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
remember our light is facing towards the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.520 
remember our light is facing towards the
back<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:24.120> Zeppelin<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
back of the Zeppelin so we have to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.900 
back of the Zeppelin so we have to
remember<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.550> only<00:03:26.700> way<00:03:26.850> you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
remember that this is the only way you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.940 
remember that this is the only way you
can<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.450> something<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.380> with<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
can do something like this is with the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.430 
can do something like this is with the
mounting<00:03:29.250> arm<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.670> as<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.810> now<00:03:31.020> we

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
mounting arm and as you can see now we

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.040 
mounting arm and as you can see now we
have<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> nice<00:03:31.800> gradual<00:03:32.670> fall<00:03:33.060> off<00:03:33.330> on<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> edge

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
have a nice gradual fall off on the edge

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.620 
have a nice gradual fall off on the edge
of<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.290> light<00:03:34.910> this<00:03:35.910> comes<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.300> handy

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
of that light this comes in handy

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.229 
of that light this comes in handy
it's<00:03:37.190> multitude<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.280> different<00:03:38.430> uses<00:03:38.970> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
it's multitude of different uses a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.760 
it's multitude of different uses a
multitude<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.840> different<00:03:39.989> light<00:03:40.320> patterns

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
multitude of different light patterns

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.990 
multitude of different light patterns
and<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:42.540> versatility<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.770> look<00:03:44.070> for<00:03:44.310> so

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
and that versatility that I look for so
