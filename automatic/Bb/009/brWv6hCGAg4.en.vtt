00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
to the roots and I'll do that until I've

rather than fresh straw as you can see
it's<00:07:24.659> already<00:07:24.839> starting<00:07:25.080> to<00:07:25.589> break<00:07:25.800> down<00:07:25.860> and

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
it's already starting to break down and

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.589 
it's already starting to break down and
by<00:07:28.139> the<00:07:28.199> time<00:07:28.379> I<00:07:28.620> take<00:07:29.129> it<00:07:29.279> off<00:07:29.520> of<00:07:29.789> this<00:07:29.969> bed<00:07:30.270> at

by the time I take it off of this bed at
the<00:07:30.719> end<00:07:30.750> of<00:07:31.199> the

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
the end of the

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.909 
the end of the
next<00:07:33.000> season<00:07:33.210> it'll<00:07:34.139> be<00:07:34.229> nice<00:07:34.409> and<00:07:34.439> broken

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 
next season it'll be nice and broken

00:07:34.919 --> 00:07:37.189 
next season it'll be nice and broken
down<00:07:35.069> and<00:07:35.340> I<00:07:35.400> put<00:07:35.430> it<00:07:35.819> into<00:07:36.120> the<00:07:36.150> compost<00:07:36.719> bins

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 
down and I put it into the compost bins

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:42.589 
down and I put it into the compost bins
so<00:07:38.129> I<00:07:38.159> just<00:07:38.430> takes<00:07:38.669> nice<00:07:38.879> chunks<00:07:39.449> and<00:07:41.419> put<00:07:42.419> them

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 
so I just takes nice chunks and put them

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:50.240 
so I just takes nice chunks and put them
around<00:07:42.750> each<00:07:43.789> its<00:07:44.789> plant<00:07:45.150> to<00:07:45.330> protect<00:07:45.719> them<00:07:49.250> so

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.250 
around each its plant to protect them so

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.290 
around each its plant to protect them so
here's<00:07:50.699> my<00:07:51.300> next<00:07:51.360> iris<00:07:52.080> bad<00:07:52.409> and<00:07:53.340> until<00:07:54.090> next
