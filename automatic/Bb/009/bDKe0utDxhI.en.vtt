00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 Speak, people, beauty, welcome, but 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 Brazilians who talk to you and saw 9 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 and won the video of the new single if it goes 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.640
 be to talk a little about the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.170
 class of shocks that I found to be 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.630
 fantastic question was that on average the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.180
 sensational because I was the one who 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.580
 shot a bulldog I was amazed by 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 the power of this pruning shot containing 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.660
 I then decided to make a video for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 you to show her the show some 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.500
 that if I can go there too because 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.940
 the movie on which you mount your 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.649
 plastic from the staff so hopefully 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 I hope you enjoyed meeting the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.539
 fantasy codes for some tips that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.180
 There are helping you do not have if you 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.010
 watching them play code or if they 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 You play but also watch the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 goal videos and I 'm sure because 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 sometimes you do not comment it did not stay 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.780
 lost in the day then this is where I go 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 try to bring a stop to add to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.550
 You then what happens to the 12th 12 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.830
 is very strong in the short-term 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 reach a faits from very close is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.720
 practically a lycra lethal machine 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.180
 there know what mano technologists in 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 2035 halloween is on do not know 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.650
 But like that, you came close to the guy 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 with shot gun 2 shots analysis sometimes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 are a shot is enough for you 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 kill the guy then practically do not have 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.210
 the guy's response time if you 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 get very close to it with optics 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.070
 so this I found very p inclusive of 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.470
 code if a lot is op 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.119
 I think it's unbalanced but at last there's no 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.939
 specific thing but the gameplay 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.750
 A general way, but finally, you 'll talk. 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.610
 about it 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.799
 in this video I think this can be 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
 a future discussion and Flemish 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.549
 under the optics and we have four tracks 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.229
 available in the game 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.640
 Are they the bulldog you are? 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.280
 seeing in the background cleaning 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 we also have this essence mts e 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.619
 attack 12 they are basically the same 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.939
 thing only that system attack gives you 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.130
 smartphones or when you me 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.380
 to grant its ammunition if it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.930
 spread - so is the new rule 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.549
 generally the two are basically the same 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 This is the place to talk about bulldogs. 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.369
 and how do you assemble your class 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.530
 so come on let's start talking 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.970
 on the water satellite is the luck 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.830
 large they have few until one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.680
 unlimited amount comparison 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.020
 other weapons then no I do not like 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.750
 use mira, I preferred to put the museum 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.280
 break with the max ex because because the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.290
 museum break will give you a little more 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 batidão greater range damage 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.130
 the max former course will give you more 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.380
 conditions of your clip I thought this 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.600
 It's cool with both of you because you sinned. 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.730
 It was for you that you got very close. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.380
 you die very easy now if 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.030
 you have a little face apart 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.830
 you will practically not be able to 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.150
 kill him no way then the 12 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.880
 are highly recommended by a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.400
 small as the tremor at 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.380
 fractions and so on those maps that 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 are more confined you can use and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.380
 abusing what you will not do 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.420
 regret in no way at ease 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.270
 All beauty, let's go out to the postage 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.800
 Here the crowd is more delicate. 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.420
 because as each player has a 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.670
 preference for a certain type of 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 ask but I found that for the class 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.630
 the 12th some prices that were well 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.300
 better than others like for example 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.010
 the slate off and it would be for you to recharge 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.110
 your faster I think it's very 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 important to 12 why you spend 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.530
 many sequential bars for example the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.209
 bulldog she has a shooting system 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
 symptomatic you give several shots 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.860
 then the solution ends up 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.260
 fast and offend slide will be very useful 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.570
 For you there's another because I think so. 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.700
 cool would act he said he will give you 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.230
 speed of movement and why you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.940
 You need this because you will be 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.260
 Running time you have to get close. 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.820
 the car to kill then why the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.920
 people are going to make you 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.870
 move faster, and also the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.880
 marathón that is for you to run and 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.320
 unlimited you will be able to complete the 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.720
 whole map you'll run more 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.120
 Hurry and you'll get a reload more 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.040
 fast is in tune with the law but five 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.760
 dots and what do you do with those five 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.019
 points 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.360
 in this part I think the stop is going 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.130
 getting a little more delicate I like 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.590
 much of a project called should know 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.420
 why is because you move and 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.000
 stop the noise is because as you 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.430
 should know in the codes if you are 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.440
 very well spaces shots and so the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.700
 You should leave if it will help you as I said. 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.140
 For you, you have to be very p 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.700
 letter kill edital and tom 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.130
 I also chose to put in my class 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.430
 or come early for you to recharge 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.140
 while you run, also wait for him 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.360
 increase your riff need jeep 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.800
 only one summary in the class 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.060
 I came back for you, you'll run. 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.890
 the faster you'll run. 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.930
 unlimited you will recharge 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.720
 while you run you will recharge 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.310
 the faster you will not make sounds and the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.500
 your rifai will be a little bit longer 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.300
 I need it and I think it's over 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.620
 fitting very well with 12 is 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.480
 including you can opt for stripped 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.000
 specialist to win more prizes if you 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.130
 has a cost and how cool and such but who 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.410
 you can choose the black pack of 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.180
 and placing a marker had 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.130
 which will also be very cool because 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.410
 as well as those on the track even made a 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.000
 video on the face of the snow if 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.290
 You want to see the link will be there. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.410
 under the inscription for so long 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.850
 this is practically the opposite of 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.530
 Snows you get a lot of field 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.360
 already the shot you have to pull 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.150
 enough then you can end up dying 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.070
 too much can sometimes then you are 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.670
 that you have support ends up being because the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.890
 most useful 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.990
 even more so if you put ballistics and 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.330
 clothes but this is more or less the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.860
 criterion of each one I prefer to play a 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.570
 little more I think that has to 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.370
 specialist because it places some 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.650
 progressives that I think are also 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.050
 legal to hatch class as per 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.240
 example there is no parent that I think 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.530
 pretty fuck I could make a video 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.370
 all just to talk about the plan 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.960
 households 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.060
 but I think it's a price that 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.040
 It's worth your while and it's worth it. 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.910
 off the grid is how you are going to stay all over 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.490
 playing 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.890
 if you catch a nice strike you will 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.210
 Yes, do you want to leave the area of 7 years? 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.250
 will want to stay there practically 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.500
 invisible to the radars is 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.760
 being cool and helpful actually is 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.460
 with this class is a class I 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.490
 I found it very consistent answers 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.020
 test you can avoid renewing change 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.700
 So I 'm passing on to you, it's kind of 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.470
 a basis for those who do not know the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.690
 work that does not know the 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.370
 knows even digital if you have an idea of 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.040
 how you assemble your character by 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.660
 other side the test there I found it 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.780
 very small when you find a 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.689
 guys together guys is 56 tj shot 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.179
 general use 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.309
 will have a good pressure with the blog I 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.779
 I have not tried the other shot gun yet 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:25.209
 but I think she must be too. 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.769
 so the bulldog counts pp I confess that 

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:29.110
 It was a very strong surprise and thought 

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:31.149
 The state is crap again, it's over. 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.259
 testing when I still played with 

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:34.299
 light machine ganz 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.249
 but if you want the people there like you are 

00:06:34.299 --> 00:06:38.439
 that you do not know if you joão alfredo 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.569
 Called if you guys watch to win, I do not know. 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.939
 I know very well what you want my audience 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.499
 code so I do not know if you 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:46.659
 play leaves a comment to childhood 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:48.999
 young radio then in the game but I see the 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.199
 video I do not know myself 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.539
 are you 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.159
 I think the good part I hope so 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.839
 that you liked the video case 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:57.309
 You guys, I can not do more 

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.719
 other classes for the other areas 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:00.639
 It is also encouraging to do with 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.709
 time will say thank you very much for being 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.089
 assisted by you enjoyed it 

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.189
 Did you like to close your I like?
