now<00:00:03.219> to<00:00:03.280> make<00:00:03.520> it<00:00:03.610> a<00:00:03.669> little<00:00:03.820> more<00:00:03.939> challenging

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:04.569 
now to make it a little more challenging

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.240 
now to make it a little more challenging
let's<00:00:04.810> take<00:00:04.990> out<00:00:05.170> that<00:00:05.290> pause<00:00:05.590> at<00:00:05.950> the<00:00:06.040> end<00:00:06.189> of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
let's take out that pause at the end of

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.610 
let's take out that pause at the end of
each<00:00:06.370> phrase<00:00:06.729> and<00:00:07.210> play<00:00:07.599> all<00:00:07.840> eighth<00:00:08.109> notes<00:00:08.380> so

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
each phrase and play all eighth notes so

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.190 
each phrase and play all eighth notes so
we're<00:00:08.769> switching<00:00:08.980> directly<00:00:09.610> from<00:00:09.820> an<00:00:10.000> a<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.240> an

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
we're switching directly from an a to an

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.430 
we're switching directly from an a to an
e<00:00:11.410> without<00:00:11.800> any<00:00:12.010> break<00:00:12.220> like<00:00:12.460> this<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:13.660> two

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
and three and four and one two now the

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.160 
and three and four and one two now the
tricky<00:01:00.670> part<00:01:00.879> is<00:01:00.999> really<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.569> transition

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
tricky part is really the transition

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.049 
tricky part is really the transition
when<00:01:02.469> you're<00:01:02.619> going<00:01:02.920> from<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.309> string<00:01:03.789> from

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
when you're going from the a string from

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.780 
when you're going from the a string from
the<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.269> note<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.049> third<00:01:05.830> string<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.670> e

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
the a note on the third string to the e

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.030 
the a note on the third string to the e
note<00:01:06.910> on<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.510> fourth<00:01:07.750> string<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.560> moment

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
note on the fourth string that moment

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.080 
note on the fourth string that moment
going<00:01:09.220> back<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.700> forth<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:12.460> there<00:01:12.790> are<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.970> few

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
going back and forth now there are a few

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.850 
going back and forth now there are a few
different<00:01:13.180> ways<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.450> practice<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:14.050> first<00:01:14.710> way

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
different ways to practice it first way

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.580 
different ways to practice it first way
is<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.190> play<00:01:15.780> quarter<00:01:16.780> notes<00:01:16.960> using<00:01:17.230> down

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
is just to play quarter notes using down

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.770 
is just to play quarter notes using down
strokes<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.160> upstrokes<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.940> down<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
strokes and upstrokes so down on the a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.980 
strokes and upstrokes so down on the a
note<00:01:20.110> up<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.160> e<00:01:21.190> note

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
note up on the e note

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.240 
note up on the e note
and<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:25.450> focus<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> left<00:01:26.380> hand<00:01:26.619> getting

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
and just focus on the left hand getting

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.440 
and just focus on the left hand getting
back<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.640> forth<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.090> get<00:01:28.240> as<00:01:28.329> much

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
back and forth so you get as much

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.510 
back and forth so you get as much
practice<00:01:28.720> as<00:01:29.020> possible<00:01:29.500> switching<00:01:30.340> back<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
practice as possible switching back and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.460 
practice as possible switching back and
forth<00:01:30.729> between<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.330> two<00:01:31.360> notes<00:01:31.689> let's<00:01:32.290> try

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
forth between the two notes let's try

00:01:32.470 --> 00:02:06.090 
forth between the two notes let's try
that<00:01:32.680> one<00:01:36.899> two<00:01:37.899> three<00:01:38.710> four<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.709> helps

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
that one two three four so that helps

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.580 
that one two three four so that helps
you<00:02:06.220> get<00:02:06.610> used<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.880> making<00:02:07.179> that<00:02:07.299> switch<00:02:07.590> back

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you get used to making that switch back

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.919 
you get used to making that switch back
and<00:02:08.619> forth<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.250> it's<00:02:09.429> also<00:02:09.610> useful<00:02:10.539> if<00:02:10.840> you

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
and forth and it's also useful if you

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.720 
and forth and it's also useful if you
ever<00:02:10.989> get<00:02:11.530> called<00:02:11.799> upon<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.100> play<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.459> part<00:02:12.670> of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
ever get called upon to play the part of

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
ever get called upon to play the part of
a<00:02:12.880> French<00:02:13.269> police<00:02:13.569> car<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.019> school<00:02:14.230> play<00:02:14.350> I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
a French police car in the school play I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.970 
a French police car in the school play I
think<00:02:15.549> that's<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.790> interval<00:02:16.120> they<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.980> now

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
think that's the interval they do now

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.770 
think that's the interval they do now
let's<00:02:18.310> do<00:02:20.160> another<00:02:21.160> version<00:02:21.670> where<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.299> do<00:02:22.510> an

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
let's do another version where we do an

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.759 
let's do another version where we do an
upstroke<00:02:23.549> on<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:25.120> note<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> Down<00:02:26.560> stroke

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
upstroke on the note a and a Down stroke

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.569 
upstroke on the note a and a Down stroke
on<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.250> e<00:02:27.959> same<00:02:28.959> exercise<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.799> upstroke<00:02:30.340> and

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
on the e same exercise just upstroke and

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.400 
on the e same exercise just upstroke and
then<00:02:30.700> down<00:02:30.940> stroke<00:02:31.269> so<00:02:31.870> start<00:02:32.200> with<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
then down stroke so start with the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.580 
then down stroke so start with the
upstroke<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.329> third<00:02:34.480> string<00:02:34.750> down<00:02:35.290> stroke

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
upstroke on the third string down stroke

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.630 
upstroke on the third string down stroke
on<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.799> fourth<00:02:35.980> string<00:02:36.040> let's<00:02:36.430> play<00:02:36.609> that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
on the fourth string let's play that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.780 
on the fourth string let's play that
together<00:02:36.940> with<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.390> click<00:02:40.769> one<00:02:41.769> two<00:02:42.459> three

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
together with the click one two three

00:02:42.790 --> 00:03:10.150 
together with the click one two three
and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.980 

now<00:03:11.160> let's<00:03:11.430> try<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.790> as<00:03:12.000> eighth<00:03:12.240> notes<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
now let's try that as eighth notes and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.790 
now let's try that as eighth notes and
let's<00:03:13.950> start<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.390> downstroke<00:03:16.020> first<00:03:16.440> so

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
let's start with the downstroke first so

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.320 
let's start with the downstroke first so
down<00:03:17.100> up<00:03:17.490> down<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.100> twice<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.640> fast<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.240> if

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
down up down up but twice as fast so if

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.770 
down up down up but twice as fast so if
you're<00:03:21.450> counting<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:21.960> two<00:03:22.460> three<00:03:23.460> four<00:03:24.000> one

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you're counting one two three four one

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.640 
you're counting one two three four one
and<00:03:25.080> two<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.860> three<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.400> four<00:03:27.380> let's<00:03:28.380> try

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
and two and three and four let's try

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:59.770 
and two and three and four let's try
that<00:03:28.800> with<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.160> click<00:03:32.390> one<00:03:33.390> two<00:03:34.080> three<00:03:34.890> four

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.600 

finally<00:04:00.780> let's<00:04:01.140> do<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:02.010> other<00:04:02.190> way<00:04:02.280> with

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
finally let's do that the other way with

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.970 
finally let's do that the other way with
the<00:04:02.640> upstroke<00:04:03.120> first<00:04:03.480> up<00:04:04.290> choke<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.800> third

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
the upstroke first up choke on the third

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.040 
the upstroke first up choke on the third
string<00:04:05.280> down<00:04:06.120> stroke<00:04:06.480> on<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.780> fourth<00:04:06.989> string

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
string down stroke on the fourth string

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:35.640 
string down stroke on the fourth string
here<00:04:07.590> we<00:04:07.709> go<00:04:10.610> one<00:04:11.610> two<00:04:12.080> three<00:04:13.080> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.920 

now<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:36.950> take<00:04:37.370> those<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:38.510> sections

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
now you can take those little sections

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.020 
now you can take those little sections
and<00:04:39.080> loop<00:04:39.350> them<00:04:39.530> on<00:04:39.860> your<00:04:40.400> player<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:40.880> if<00:04:40.940> you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
and loop them on your player so if you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.370 
and loop them on your player so if you
want<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.270> play<00:04:41.420> along<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.900> practice<00:04:42.260> with

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
want to play along and practice with

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.080 
want to play along and practice with
them<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:42.680> can<00:04:42.890> or<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.460> can<00:04:43.670> just<00:04:43.760> set<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:44.030> a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
them you can or you can just set up a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.570 
them you can or you can just set up a
metronome<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.660> do<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.080> on<00:04:45.170> your<00:04:45.200> own<00:04:45.580> once

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
metronome and do it on your own once

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.280 
metronome and do it on your own once
you've<00:04:46.760> gotten<00:04:47.240> comfortable<00:04:47.450> with<00:04:47.660> those<00:04:47.900> and

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
you've gotten comfortable with those and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.740 
you've gotten comfortable with those and
really<00:04:49.010> just<00:04:49.190> start<00:04:50.150> with<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.330> quarter<00:04:50.600> note

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
really just start with the quarter note

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.940 
really just start with the quarter note
ones<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.110> then<00:04:51.200> if<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.350> want<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.620> move<00:04:51.740> on<00:04:51.800> to

ones and then if you want to move on to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.060 
ones and then if you want to move on to
the<00:04:52.040> eighth<00:04:52.160> ones<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:53.090> can<00:04:53.770> either<00:04:54.770> way

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
the eighth ones you can either way

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.340 
the eighth ones you can either way
you'll<00:04:55.280> get<00:04:55.370> enough<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.730> a<00:04:55.850> workout<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.390> be

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
that now and actually start putting this

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.520 
that now and actually start putting this
into<00:05:01.490> something<00:05:01.960> into<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> more<00:05:03.200> musical
