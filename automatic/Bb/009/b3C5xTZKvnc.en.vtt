some other albums that were just a
little<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.480> better<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> a

little bit better which is kind of a
strange<00:01:02.100> phenomenon<00:01:02.699> something<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.149> rarely

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
seems though there was a misstep that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.370 
seems though there was a misstep that
occurred<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.360> payment<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> existence

think<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.069> album<00:05:14.460> is<00:05:14.580> pretty<00:05:15.120> damn<00:05:15.750> good<00:05:16.050> and

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
think this album is pretty damn good and

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.559 
think this album is pretty damn good and
actually<00:05:17.039> comes<00:05:17.250> very<00:05:17.460> close<00:05:17.699> to<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.029> 9<00:05:18.330> out<00:05:18.539> of

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
actually comes very close to a 9 out of

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.439 
actually comes very close to a 9 out of
10<00:05:18.839> i<00:05:19.080> would<00:05:19.589> say<00:05:19.770> probably<00:05:20.089> 8.75<00:05:21.089> for

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
10 i would say probably 8.75 for

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.350 
10 i would say probably 8.75 for
conservation<00:05:22.289> sake<00:05:22.529> and<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.919> not<00:05:23.310> really<00:05:24.029> show

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
conservation sake and to not really show

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.629 
conservation sake and to not really show
myself<00:05:24.659> as<00:05:25.080> too<00:05:25.349> much<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.529> a<00:05:25.710> fanboy<00:05:26.159> because

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
myself as too much of a fanboy because

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.269 
myself as too much of a fanboy because
well<00:05:26.879> I<00:05:27.120> do<00:05:27.509> love<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.110> band<00:05:28.349> however<00:05:29.039> I<00:05:29.129> do

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:29.279 
well I do love this band however I do

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:31.969 
well I do love this band however I do
have<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.610> be<00:05:29.789> impartial<00:05:30.529> however<00:05:31.529> onto<00:05:31.889> the

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
have to be impartial however onto the

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.490 
have to be impartial however onto the
cover<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.909> cover<00:05:32.939> is<00:05:33.360> one<00:05:33.539> thing<00:05:33.839> that<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:34.319> I

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
cover the cover is one thing that if I

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.769 
cover the cover is one thing that if I
was<00:05:34.800> up<00:05:35.039> able<00:05:35.699> to<00:05:35.819> be<00:05:35.909> completely<00:05:36.150> partial

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
was up able to be completely partial

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:39.050 
was up able to be completely partial
would<00:05:37.080> immediately<00:05:37.439> turn<00:05:38.189> this<00:05:38.339> album<00:05:38.729> into<00:05:39.029> a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
would immediately turn this album into a

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.379 
would immediately turn this album into a
10<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:40.289> tenth<00:05:40.529> track<00:05:40.849> coincidence<00:05:41.849> or<00:05:42.000> irony

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
10 the tenth track coincidence or irony

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.619 
10 the tenth track coincidence or irony
I<00:05:42.629> think<00:05:43.199> not<00:05:43.349> is<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:44.430> in<00:05:44.550> Union<00:05:45.120> we<00:05:45.270> stand

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
I think not is it in Union we stand

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.050 
I think not is it in Union we stand
which<00:05:45.930> is<00:05:46.080> an<00:05:46.199> overkill<00:05:46.740> cover<00:05:47.009> and<00:05:47.279> probably

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
which is an overkill cover and probably

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.879 
which is an overkill cover and probably
one<00:05:48.330> of<00:05:48.360> my<00:05:48.479> favorite<00:05:48.930> overkill<00:05:49.409> songs<00:05:49.649> of<00:05:49.800> all

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
one of my favorite overkill songs of all

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.929 
one of my favorite overkill songs of all
time<00:05:50.159> and<00:05:50.539> communities<00:05:51.949> yeah<00:05:52.949> it's<00:05:53.729> not

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
time and communities yeah it's not

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.209 
time and communities yeah it's not
exactly<00:05:54.330> Bobby<00:05:54.629> blitz<00:05:54.870> in<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.080> boys<00:05:55.319> but<00:05:55.740> they

that's<00:06:08.009> the<00:06:08.279> key<00:06:08.460> portion<00:06:08.969> of<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.149> cover<00:06:09.360> that

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
that's the key portion of the cover that

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.179 
that's the key portion of the cover that
I<00:06:09.599> really<00:06:09.930> enjoy<00:06:10.259> the<00:06:10.680> fact<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:10.979> they<00:06:11.129> were

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
I really enjoy the fact that they were

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:13.189 
I really enjoy the fact that they were
able<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.520> make<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:11.789> minor<00:06:12.180> alteration<00:06:12.899> to<00:06:12.930> it

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
able to make a minor alteration to it

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.350 
able to make a minor alteration to it
and<00:06:13.349> still<00:06:14.189> make<00:06:14.430> it<00:06:14.460> fit<00:06:14.759> the<00:06:14.789> song<00:06:15.120> so

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
and still make it fit the song so

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.749 
and still make it fit the song so
perfectly<00:06:15.810> that<00:06:16.050> maybe<00:06:16.949> even<00:06:17.159> Bobby<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:17.699> the

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
perfectly that maybe even Bobby and the

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.040 
perfectly that maybe even Bobby and the
boys<00:06:17.909> would<00:06:18.089> take<00:06:18.389> a<00:06:18.419> look<00:06:18.629> at<00:06:18.719> this<00:06:18.839> and

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
boys would take a look at this and

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.839 
boys would take a look at this and
listen<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.379> it<00:06:19.409> and<00:06:19.560> think<00:06:19.740> huh<00:06:20.279> that's

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
listen to it and think huh that's

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.159 
listen to it and think huh that's
something<00:06:21.060> we<00:06:21.300> could<00:06:21.419> even<00:06:21.569> try<00:06:21.750> to<00:06:21.810> do<00:06:21.990> live

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
something we could even try to do live

really believe that these guys have a

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.920 
really believe that these guys have a
strong<00:06:52.550> case<00:06:52.790> for<00:06:52.850> album<00:06:53.390> of<00:06:53.450> the<00:06:53.510> year<00:06:53.780> this

strong case for album of the year this

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.320 
strong case for album of the year this
year<00:06:53.990> they<00:06:54.830> may<00:06:55.010> fall<00:06:55.280> short<00:06:55.310> once<00:06:55.790> again<00:06:56.120> as
