what<00:00:38.270> I've<00:00:38.390> done<00:00:38.600> what<00:00:39.110> I've<00:00:39.200> had<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:39.410> do

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
what I've done what I've had to do

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.940 
what I've done what I've had to do
actually<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.670> use<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.660> Cheyenne<00:00:42.350> face<00:00:42.590> and

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
actually is use the Cheyenne face and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.930 
actually is use the Cheyenne face and
the<00:00:43.730> Cheyenne<00:00:44.260> arms<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.500> then<00:00:46.340> I've<00:00:46.460> got<00:00:46.640> half

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
the Cheyenne arms and then I've got half

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.190 
the Cheyenne arms and then I've got half
torso<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.340> legs<00:00:49.340> that<00:00:49.520> go<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:49.970> torso

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
torso and legs that go with the torso

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.540 
torso and legs that go with the torso
the<00:00:51.200> reason<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.500> didn't<00:00:51.860> use<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.190> Cheyenne

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the reason I didn't use the Cheyenne

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.979 
the reason I didn't use the Cheyenne
legs<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.910> because<00:00:53.180> they<00:00:53.329> don't<00:00:53.510> actually<00:00:53.660> fit

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
legs is because they don't actually fit

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.290 
legs is because they don't actually fit
into<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.650> sockets<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:55.700> I've<00:00:55.790> actually<00:00:55.880> had<00:00:56.149> to

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
into the sockets so I've actually had to

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.170 
into the sockets so I've actually had to
match<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.690> half<00:00:56.870> torso<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.730> Cheyenne

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
match the half torso with the Cheyenne

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.360 
match the half torso with the Cheyenne
doll<00:00:59.420> kid<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.899> I<00:01:00.649> think<00:01:00.860> she's<00:01:01.010> actually

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
doll kid and I think she's actually

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.510 
doll kid and I think she's actually
turned<00:01:01.579> out<00:01:01.730> really<00:01:02.110> really<00:01:03.110> cute<00:01:03.399> and<00:01:04.399> I'm

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
turned out really really cute and I'm

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.120 
turned out really really cute and I'm
really<00:01:04.790> really<00:01:04.850> happy<00:01:05.239> with<00:01:05.270> her<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.950> that's

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
really really happy with her so that's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.280 
really really happy with her so that's
her<00:01:07.310> finished<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:08.660> this<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.080> black

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
her finished and then this is the black

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.620 
her finished and then this is the black
dial<00:01:09.710> kit<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.130> can<00:01:10.250> actually<00:01:10.369> see<00:01:10.759> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
dial kit so you can actually see the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.050 
dial kit so you can actually see the
color<00:01:11.810> difference<00:01:11.960> I'm<00:01:12.470> hoping<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:14.030> two

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
color difference I'm hoping the two

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.880 
color difference I'm hoping the two
vinyl<00:01:14.360> colors<00:01:14.810> again<00:01:15.320> they're<00:01:15.680> made<00:01:15.860> by

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
vinyl colors again they're made by

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.609 
vinyl colors again they're made by
different<00:01:16.250> manufacturers<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:18.170> violet<00:01:18.500> is

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
different manufacturers so the violet is

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.020 
different manufacturers so the violet is
different<00:01:18.979> than<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.190> do<00:01:19.340> have<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:19.670> match<00:01:19.820> it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
different than you do have to match it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.999 
different than you do have to match it
so<00:01:20.899> we've<00:01:21.110> got<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.410> banner<00:01:21.560> for<00:01:21.770> baby

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
so we've got the banner for baby

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.290 
so we've got the banner for baby
Cheyenne<00:01:22.509> in<00:01:23.509> a<00:01:23.630> nice<00:01:23.840> peach<00:01:25.119> looks<00:01:26.119> sort<00:01:26.270> of

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
Cheyenne in a nice peach looks sort of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.260 
Cheyenne in a nice peach looks sort of
like<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.479> gray<00:01:26.780> color<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.000> Audrey

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
like a gray color and then the Audrey

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.800

Stoke torsos are more of orangey sort of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.960 
Stoke torsos are more of orangey sort of
color<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.200> I've<00:01:33.259> had<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.619> neutralize<00:01:33.970> the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
color so I've had to neutralize the

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.180 
color so I've had to neutralize the
orange<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:36.050> sort<00:01:36.259> of<00:01:36.289> bring<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.590> down<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.009> more

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
of the pale colour and then away I go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.820 
of the pale colour and then away I go
doing<00:01:40.940> my<00:01:41.060> rear<00:01:41.240> warning<00:01:41.539> so<00:01:42.470> that's<00:01:42.709> the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
doing my rear warning so that's the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.770 
doing my rear warning so that's the
torso<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.459> I<00:01:43.580> said<00:01:43.789> with<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.240> legs<00:01:44.479> as

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
torso and like I said with the legs as

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.870 
torso and like I said with the legs as
well

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
well

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.529 
well
the<00:01:46.910> Audrey<00:01:47.270> Stoke<00:01:47.479> torsos<00:01:47.959> have<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.039> have<00:01:49.539> her

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
the Audrey Stoke torsos have to have her

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.169 
the Audrey Stoke torsos have to have her
legs<00:01:50.869> because<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.340> way<00:01:52.459> that<00:01:52.610> she's<00:01:52.789> designed

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
legs because the way that she's designed

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.630 
legs because the way that she's designed
them<00:01:53.330> they<00:01:53.479> go<00:01:53.630> into<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.110> sockets<00:01:54.640> whereas

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
them they go into the sockets whereas

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.290 
them they go into the sockets whereas
the<00:01:55.940> Cheyenne<00:01:57.039> original<00:01:58.039> legs<00:01:58.250> they<00:01:59.119> don't

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
the Cheyenne original legs they don't

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.469 
the Cheyenne original legs they don't
actually<00:01:59.479> fit<00:01:59.750> into<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:01.550> socket<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.330> there

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
actually fit into the socket so there

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.580 
actually fit into the socket so there
you<00:02:02.569> go<00:02:02.660> you<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:02.869> actually<00:02:02.899> see<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.410> two

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
you go you can actually see the two

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.650 
you go you can actually see the two
different<00:02:03.619> vinyl<00:02:04.160> colors<00:02:04.429> so<00:02:05.390> I've<00:02:05.479> had<00:02:05.630> to

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
different vinyl colors so I've had to
