00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 This cooking class we create a typically dutch 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.370
 dish pea soup 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.299
 is in popularly known as lousy enough 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.460
 but I actually like it a bit 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.660
 disrespectfully and with a piece 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 rye bread and bacon 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.340
 can you really wake me up the night before 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.340
 to make 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.900
 I have you all the ingredient for the pea 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 soup are ready but we start with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.170
 set up the broth use 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.170
 one and a half liters of water for that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
 we add 300 grams of split peas to that 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.250
 are from those halved green peas 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.640
 and they halve them so that they cook faster 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.640
 to become 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.320
 a bay leaf 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 and 1 tablespoon of salt and two chops 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 you just have to pan it under it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.170
 water 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 then the fire can go on and then I bring it 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.739
 to the boil 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.550
 indispensable in the pea soup 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.079
 celeriac is best slandered day in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.629
 tuber to cut to that is too 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.550
 gnarled is that goes very easily 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 first remove that knotty bottom 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 see cutting 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 this way it can stay nicely on the shelf 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 system then you can calm down with 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 all your attention peel around it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.690
 going to cut the fun of celeriac 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.190
 is that it looks nice looking 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.780
 it's those beautiful white blocks that you 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.630
 often looks in the soup and it has one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.580
 nice fresh flavors 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.020
 well peel and punishment now that can stick in 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.400
 are going to be cut by topping it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.400
 paste a centimeter 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.120
 and if you have those you can 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.090
 those slices will stack again 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.700
 bad there are a few on each other two then 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.320
 you put them in the bars again and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.090
 then you can do that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.090
 cut into strips 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.869
 because there is to the peel of the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
 Celeriac is sometimes sandy 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.549
 important to take those blocks as well 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.240
 wash a little under the tap 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.240
 unrest will 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.080
 if there was any sand left on it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.560
 that you have new fall off 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.560
 let it leak 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.069
 Leek is also delicious in the pea soup 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.360
 often there is a bit of sand in it and that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.160
 you can remove as follows first cut 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.600
 the ends off 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.600
 a little bit of the green leaf 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 then you cut me in half 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.340
 and then you will see that often here in the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.900
 there is sand at the ends 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.000
 Well that sand I feel like that first 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.560
 just the other leek 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.910
 such a treatment then they go under the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.140
 tap tap on it and then just as good 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.140
 rinse between those leaves 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.090
 shake the water out and now the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.330
 leek ready to cut into rings 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.330
 to become 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.040
 so side by side on the shelf two 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.270
 at the same time , they then meet in half rings 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.270
 of an inch 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.599
 just clean the shelf and then you can 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.599
 I will cut the following ingredient 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.340
 that is the celery root 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.300
 not only celeriac goes in there 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.030
 that pea soup but that is also possible 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.830
 I have found celery leaves here 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.390
 gives a very typical taste to that 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.319
 pea soup is also indispensable 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.760
 ingredient 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.770
 This makes that he was looking for 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.480
 pea soup will taste 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.610
 I only use very thick leaves 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.940
 cuts yes that are too stiff in use 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.940
 we don't 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.040
 I chop those leaves nice and fine because 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.360
 to small they are the more flavors can be 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.069
 hand off 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.239
 meat street to cook for a while that is 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.830
 has now become cool 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.830
 I take it from the pan 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.060
 it equally drain on cutting board 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.040
 because I'm going to cut this meat into small cubes 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.690
 which I can do back in the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.700
 soup and you have his chops sitting there 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.150
 always such a sign on all that first 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.229
 just what and then what you have left you can 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.229
 cut into small cubes 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.129
 I have reasonably refractory hands 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.009
 but you could also take a few minutes 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:30.210
 wait until it has cooled slightly 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.360
 then you can fix that easier 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.360
 to hold 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.069
 I'm going to finish the soup and the vegetables 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.389
 can add to it and the reason why I use the 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.159
 vegetables not immediately from the start 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.780
 is because your vegetables are like that 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.099
 hold on a little bit but they 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.900
 of course still need one 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.080
 little yarn so therefore sit down now 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.080
 at 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.840
 prepare at 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.169
 and the meat 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.310
 then the finely chopped celery is added 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.450
 do not use anything that is nice as 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.730
 garnish over the soup later no good 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.200
 pea soup without getting too breast 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.540
 the tastiest if it takes just a minute 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.100
 or 20 can get used in the soup which 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.510
 nice and soft and he also gets something 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.330
 a little of that soup 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.770
 inside that sausage on those vegetables 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.170
 needed some time 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.880
 so everything will be at the same time 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.470
 ready so the soup is now almost ready 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.030
 only the sausage still has to be sliced 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.760
 be cut 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.020
 ellen dr get out with pliers and you 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.430
 will see 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.410
 the sausage is almost in volume 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.120
 doubled that he was completely full 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.100
 sucked with that soup 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.370
 that is the function of cutting well 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.960
 is given in slices and then you can 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.650
 so back in the soup here too 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.910
 of course 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.450
 you can leave it for a few minutes 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:06:01.670
 cool down see just a bit brighter 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:03.170
 which is easier to hold in soup 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.870
 it lets the soup simmer for a little while 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.760
 and then it can serve one 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.950
 so that smells nice and delicious 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.090
 split pea soup 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.590
 if you find something thick soup can 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.290
 of course add some hot water 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.680
 but I think it's a great thing 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.680
 stuffed up 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.450
 nice and coarse and you still have all the vegetables 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.450
 can taste good 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.020
 and then the finishing touch 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:40.160
 the withheld celery over it 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.160
 and that's how you make Dutch pea soup
