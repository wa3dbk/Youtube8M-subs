back to another my tutorial today I want
to<00:00:06.660> answer<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.410> question<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.670> one

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
to answer a question that I got on one

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660 
to answer a question that I got on one
of<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:09.120> videos<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.440> created<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.099> video<00:00:11.370> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
of my videos and I created a video on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.180 
of my videos and I created a video on
how<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> make<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> chess<00:00:13.290> piece<00:00:13.530> under<00:00:13.980> one

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
how to make a chess piece under one

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.060 
how to make a chess piece under one
minute<00:00:14.340> using<00:00:14.790> CV<00:00:15.360> curve<00:00:15.509> tool<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.070> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
minute using CV curve tool and the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
minute using CV curve tool and the
question<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:18.029> okay<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.779> now<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
question that I got was okay so now I

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
question that I got was okay so now I
created<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> can't<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.730> anything

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
created that but I can't do anything

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.380 
created that but I can't do anything
with<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
with it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
with it
I<00:00:21.510> can't<00:00:21.779> manipulate<00:00:22.020> faces<00:00:22.740> or<00:00:22.890> anything

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I can't manipulate faces or anything

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.540 
I can't manipulate faces or anything
like<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.430> because<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> polygon<00:00:24.510> so

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
like that because it's not a polygon so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
like that because it's not a polygon so
can<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> change<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.269> into<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.599> polygon<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.890> can

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
can I change that into a polygon or can

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.269 
can I change that into a polygon or can
I<00:00:29.160> create<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> polygon<00:00:30.380> okay<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.439> what

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
I create it as a polygon okay so what

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.110 
I create it as a polygon okay so what
I'm<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.790> I'm<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> answer

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
I'm going to do is I'm going to answer

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
I'm going to do is I'm going to answer
that<00:00:33.210> question<00:00:33.890> okay<00:00:34.890> we're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> start

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that question okay we're going to start

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.330 
that question okay we're going to start
off<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:35.640> creating<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.840> object<00:00:37.160> doesn't<00:00:38.160> have

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
off by creating an object doesn't have

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.200 
off by creating an object doesn't have
to<00:00:38.610> necessarily<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:40.309> chess<00:00:41.309> piece<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to necessarily be a chess piece but you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.850 
to necessarily be a chess piece but you
know<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:45.649> polygons<00:00:46.649> menu<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
know so in your polygons menu go to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.290 
know so in your polygons menu go to
create<00:00:51.050> CV<00:00:52.050> curve<00:00:52.289> tool<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> we're<00:00:54.120> just

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
create CV curve tool and we're just

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.000 
create CV curve tool and we're just
going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> quickly<00:00:55.020> create<00:00:56.010> something

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
going to quickly create something

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to quickly create something
doesn't<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.309> matter<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> point

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
doesn't really matter it's not the point

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:17.370 
doesn't really matter it's not the point
of<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.629> exercise<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.410> now

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.770 

I<00:01:17.409> don't<00:01:18.220> know<00:01:18.340> some<00:01:18.580> like<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.909> all<00:01:19.630> right

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
I don't know some like that all right

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
I don't know some like that all right
hit<00:01:20.140> enter

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
hit enter

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.340 
hit enter
we're<00:01:22.659> going<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.869> go<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.080> perspective<00:01:23.860> view<00:01:24.100> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
we're going to go to perspective view I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850 
we're going to go to perspective view I
got<00:01:26.350> my<00:01:26.530> CV<00:01:26.860> curve<00:01:27.119> selected<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:29.590> to<00:01:29.650> your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
got my CV curve selected go to your

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.859 
got my CV curve selected go to your
services<00:01:30.960> tab<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.320> then<00:01:33.250> in<00:01:33.600> services<00:01:34.600> hit

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
services tab and then in services hit

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.999 
services tab and then in services hit
revolve<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:37.119> 5-4<00:01:37.899> shaded<00:01:38.229> mode<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:40.479> we<00:01:40.539> go

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
revolve at 5-4 shaded mode there we go

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.370 
revolve at 5-4 shaded mode there we go
alright<00:01:42.009> not<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:42.970> I'll<00:01:43.600> just<00:01:43.780> pull<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
alright not so I'll just pull that up a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.810 
alright not so I'll just pull that up a
little<00:01:44.560> bit<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.039> can<00:01:45.100> see<00:01:45.190> it<00:01:45.369> better<00:01:45.520> I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
little bit so you can see it better I

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.399 
little bit so you can see it better I
done<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.470> we<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.920> get<00:01:48.070> rid<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:49.270> one<00:01:49.479> okay

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
done and we can get rid of that one okay

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.850 
done and we can get rid of that one okay
so<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.940> thing<00:01:52.119> was<00:01:52.300> okay<00:01:52.929> if<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.409> select<00:01:53.679> this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
so the thing was okay if I select this

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.120 
so the thing was okay if I select this
and<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.429> want<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.789> you<00:01:55.390> know<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:56.710> with<00:01:57.039> the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and I want to you know do it with the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.430 
and I want to you know do it with the
faces<00:01:57.550> or<00:01:57.670> stuff<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.030> can't<00:01:58.360> because<00:01:59.259> not<00:01:59.409> a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
faces or stuff I can't because not a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.120 
faces or stuff I can't because not a
polygon<00:01:59.890> well<00:02:00.880> why<00:02:01.390> isn't<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.080> polygon<00:02:02.500> it's

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
polygon well why isn't it a polygon it's

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.969 
polygon well why isn't it a polygon it's
not<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.340> polygon<00:02:03.729> because<00:02:04.030> it's<00:02:04.149> an<00:02:04.270> herb<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.710> if

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
not a polygon because it's an herb so if

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.729 
not a polygon because it's an herb so if
we<00:02:06.190> want<00:02:06.429> to<00:02:06.490> change<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.630> into<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.259> polygon

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
we want to change this into a polygon

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.420 
we want to change this into a polygon
this<00:02:09.130> what<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.489> do<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.989> select<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.069> object

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
this what you do you select your object

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.080 
this what you do you select your object
and<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:13.540> go<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.890> modify<00:02:16.049> convert<00:02:17.850> nerves<00:02:18.850> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and you go to modify convert nerves to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.340 
and you go to modify convert nerves to
polygons<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.900> hit<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:20.920> option<00:02:21.069> box<00:02:22.079> now<00:02:23.079> it's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
polygons and hit the option box now it's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.930 
polygons and hit the option box now it's
important<00:02:23.799> here<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.459> need<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.670> make<00:02:24.910> sure

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
important here is you need to make sure

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.850 
important here is you need to make sure
if<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.510> want<00:02:25.690> triangle<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.709> select

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
if you want triangle so you select

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.009 
if you want triangle so you select
triangles<00:02:27.519> if<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.850> want<00:02:28.030> quads<00:02:28.360> which<00:02:28.870> I

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
triangles if you want quads which I

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:29.699 
triangles if you want quads which I
usually<00:02:29.170> do

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
usually do

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.120 
usually do
it's<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.310> quads<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.620> important

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it's like quads now this is important

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
it's like quads now this is important
hit<00:02:33.640> apply<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.630> see<00:02:37.810> now<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:38.320> it's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
hit apply and what you see now is it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.220 
hit apply and what you see now is it's
starting<00:02:38.859> to<00:02:39.010> look<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.190> funky<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.079> if<00:02:41.079> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
starting to look really funky and if I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.729 
starting to look really funky and if I
try<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> faces<00:02:44.320> here<00:02:44.560> but

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
try to get I can get the faces here but

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.470 
try to get I can get the faces here but
they<00:02:44.829> look<00:02:44.980> weird

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
they look weird

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.199 
they look weird
reason<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.709> hit<00:02:47.980> W<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:48.910> move<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
reason is if you hit W and you move it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.789 
reason is if you hit W and you move it
over<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:50.320> made<00:02:50.859> a<00:02:50.890> polygon<00:02:51.670> copy<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.680> is

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
over it made a polygon copy so this is

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.520 
over it made a polygon copy so this is
your<00:02:53.980> nerve<00:02:54.220> copy<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.720> your<00:02:55.930> polygon

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
your nerve copy this is your polygon

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.370 
your nerve copy this is your polygon
copy<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.130> I'll<00:02:57.430> show<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.109> right<00:02:59.109> click<00:02:59.260> on

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
copy and I'll show you right click on

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.289 
copy and I'll show you right click on
that<00:02:59.500> one<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.040> can't<00:03:00.640> find<00:03:01.320> face<00:03:03.060> click<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.180> that

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
that one I can't find face click on that

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.330 
that one I can't find face click on that
one<00:03:04.540> right<00:03:05.049> click<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.920> can't<00:03:06.190> find<00:03:06.400> face<00:03:06.840> so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
one right click and I can't find face so

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.720 
one right click and I can't find face so
this<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.579> how<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.920> turn<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.100> into<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.340> polygon

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
this is how you turn it into a polygon

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.620 
this is how you turn it into a polygon
I'm<00:03:12.970> going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> delete<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.569> nerve<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.019> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
I'm going to delete the nerve one and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.120 
I'm going to delete the nerve one and
I'll<00:03:16.630> just<00:03:16.959> prove<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.650> I'm<00:03:17.890> going<00:03:17.980> to

I'll just prove it to you I'm going to

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.110 
I'll just prove it to you I'm going to
go<00:03:18.549> right<00:03:19.000> click<00:03:19.030> your<00:03:19.359> face<00:03:20.760> slip<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> face

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
go right click your face slip the face

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.400 
go right click your face slip the face
and<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.340> manipulate<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:25.410> all

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
and you know I can manipulate it all

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.439 
and you know I can manipulate it all
right<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> hope<00:03:27.579> that<00:03:27.639> answers<00:03:28.239> your
