00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello gorgeous if we are in the last 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:05.700
 program of the season we are going to 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.280
 take advantage of that we are in Spain 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.249
 melting at almost 40 degrees centigrade 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.929
 this is horrible to make an ice cream a 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.610
 Cheesecake ice cream I think I have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 all versions or almost all 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.259
 versions of cheesecake I was missing 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 the ice cream because here is taking advantage 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.650
 last year we made ice cream 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.789
 chocolate with refrigerator in many of 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.009
 you asked me if there is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.779
 possibility of doing without it for that 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.369
 today we will do it without a refrigerator and also not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.259
 We will talk in the traditional way 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.960
 go stirring every 30 minutes you have 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.300
 to be watching videos in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.280
 youtube in a fairly simple way 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.980
 I do not know if it will turn out well or not sure yes 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.980
 and we will experience it together 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.520
 in a bowl we throw 200 grams of cheese 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 Mascarpone or any type of cheese 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.620
 cream 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.620
 200 milliliters of cream to assemble or 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 cream to beat 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 75 milliliters of whole milk 65 grams 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 of natural Greek yogurt or fresh cream and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.500
 finally 75 grams of icing sugar 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.759
 we beat a little with some rods 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.110
 electric to undo the cheese and 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.939
 we just mixed with some rods 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.320
 manuals you will see how it is expressing 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.580
 our mix as all the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.580
 ingredients are integrated 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 we need a bag type say is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880
 important that this type of bags and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.180
 not another to get freeze it like 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 we want we 'll see why 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.370
 we put the mixture in the bag with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370
 watch out 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 we take all the air out and close 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.320
 We distribute the test throughout the bag 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.020
 we have to get a uniform thickness and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.220
 not very thick all over the surface 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.229
 We put the bag in a tray so that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.119
 freeze completely straight and at 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.799
 freezer for 2 hours or until 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.070
 is totally frozen but not very 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.070
 hard 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.049
 as you can see it is totally frozen but 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 it is a malleable mass if it were very 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.299
 lasts we leave it at room temperature 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.299
 a few minutes 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.490
 We put the ice cream in a chopper and 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.810
 we crush in this way we break the 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.810
 crystals that could have been created 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.100
 we have to get to crush all the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.100
 mixture does not know how to stay this consistency 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.210
 and now we can add a jam 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.590
 fruit or whatever we want, I 'm going to 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.590
 add three or four crackers 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 you can add them now or in the moment 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.180
 to serve if we add them now will be 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.040
 soft if you want them to contribute 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.270
 crispy touch we add them right in 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.270
 the time to serve the ice cream 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.019
 we cut 170 grams of cherries to woods 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.150
 in syrup I love the taste of this 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.040
 Typical Italian beer if you do not have 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.930
 you can add any jam fruit 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.319
 fresh fruit in syrup or whatever else 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.319
 like 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.080
 I will throw only the fruit but the liquid 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.520
 we mix and toss in a tupper or a 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.520
 stainless container for ice cream 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.310
 I have covered it with vegetal paper and with 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.310
 other bits what appears 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.610
 direct to the freezer 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.110
 We took out of the freezer 30 minutes before 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.110
 to serve 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.180
 that is to say that the texture that was a lot 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.130
 better if we do it with refrigerator I have 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.780
 made the two versions at home but what 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.400
 You want me to tell you, we are not going to 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.680
 give up a rich homemade ice cream if you do not 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.450
 we have a refrigerator so this one had 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.900
 a less creamy texture also fell 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.900
 whole 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 happy summer enjoy the holidays 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.550
