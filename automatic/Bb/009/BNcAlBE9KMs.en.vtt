00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.290
 in a row it's huge 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.739
 you put me a little done this done 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.510
 meiway of the move it is clear that it is a 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.910
 town ben me who rather wear me 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.140
 happiness 4 reflex in a row for 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.470
 the moment I won I hope to make the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.450
 fifth this weekend they changed the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.560
 room thing that bothers a little because 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.810
 that there are a lot of problems with 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.400
 readers it's a little disturbing in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.500
 a meaning because before he is to say who 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.810
 he fell a fifa code and halo 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.350
 separately every week so it was 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.030
 pretty good 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.619
 everyone is there and all the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.420
 world was used to strong this is the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.580
 ninth anyway so there have been eight 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.020
 in the same building and there it is clear 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.369
 that it changes a little the sphere of the very 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.110
 large there are many people but 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.790
 it is clear that suddenly that some 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.770
 problems that makes the equals hours 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.840
 the 18 hours and we still have not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.580
 played it's clear it's a bit boring 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.509
 body is precisely the fact that you 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.729
 have not played the least 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.840
 mapad almost 18 hours is what 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.610
 you think it can penalize you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.140
 in the long run of turning we will say 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.610
 that I was quite happy with 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.659
 to be able to play finally it's true that I 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.890
 no longer really want to play but my 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 finally we wait more what suddenly 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 but does not care if we play on their I 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.979
 say so much better especially not too bad we have 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.500
 too much waited on arabia that happens to them 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.700
 and tell me we arrive at noon that's it 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.259
 make a life that makes it so stupid it does 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.619
 six hours we expect frankly I 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.939
 I do not want to wait for porpoises anymore 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.530
 well, yes we saw that there were 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.909
 small electricity problems so no 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.789
 many games played 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.850
 a little high level prognosis we're going 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.110
 say of the top 3 general kota maybe 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.400
 other years generally I know that 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.320
 the lighthouses etc. to the dragons did very 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.720
 wrong to previous online so there they 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.340
 leave a little favorite there are tec 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.730
 also that they are not bad there are 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.520
 which team also there is a neutral opinion 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.780
 yes the all-stars of torres precisely 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.740
 who can claim largely to the top 3 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.050
 so we will do our best too 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.100
 to do it before lalanne I should have 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.780
 go down but there they just lost 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.070
 in the first round unfortunately I think 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.200
 that they underestimated their opponents 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.280
 which were very good too but to see 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.140
 if we make a comeback or not but there 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 I think the three teams mentioned 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.190
 widely afford Baltic 3 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180
 you agree or not on what 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.790
 think I 'd say we're going to finish 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.970
 typing ok so ben that's not it if we can 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.820
 zoom in there but I trust my 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.040
 team we trained at age and hg 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.270
 we have a dog we win it will not be 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.680
 luck when it's a job deserves and 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.060
 we really got so much 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.850
 well there we spent a lot of hours 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.930
 this week to play we beat 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.490
 almost all European teams 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.100
 that there was and we played against 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.050
 dignitas badly played against pretty much 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.730
 all the big European teams 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.810
 and hear maicon according to the bri a card 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.360
 so it's normal that I'm aware 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.490
 and I go first simply 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.380
 in view of the girl I live this first true 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.630
 sorry we will say instead of the teams 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.450
