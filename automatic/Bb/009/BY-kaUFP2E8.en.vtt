good to go and you can exce this program
that's<00:01:48.360> fine<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:49.259> run<00:01:49.619> your<00:01:49.799> Tomb<00:01:49.979> Raider

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that's fine and now run your Tomb Raider

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.330 
that's fine and now run your Tomb Raider
XE<00:01:50.880> program<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:52.049> ps2<00:01:52.380> controller<00:01:52.710> or

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
XE program and your ps2 controller or

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.010 
XE program and your ps2 controller or
whatever<00:01:53.640> controller<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.149> using<00:01:54.390> should

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
whatever controller you're using should

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
whatever controller you're using should
be<00:01:55.140> automatically<00:01:55.770> recognized<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> game

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
be automatically recognized in the game

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
be automatically recognized in the game
so<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.149> said<00:01:57.390> let's<00:01:57.600> jump<00:01:57.810> straight

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so with that said let's jump straight

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
so with that said let's jump straight
into<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> gameplay<00:01:58.799> footage<00:01:59.310> tutorial

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
into the gameplay footage tutorial

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
into the gameplay footage tutorial
alright<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> main<00:02:01.649> menu

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
alright so here we are at the main menu

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.709 
alright so here we are at the main menu
a<00:02:02.009> Tomb<00:02:02.219> Raider<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.610> let's<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.509> here's

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
a Tomb Raider so let's do this so here's

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
a Tomb Raider so let's do this so here's
my<00:02:03.869> ps2<00:02:04.290> controller<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.969> want<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> see

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
my ps2 controller and if you want to see

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
my ps2 controller and if you want to see
what<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> mapping<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.259> let's<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
what the mapping is let's go down to

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.940 
what the mapping is let's go down to
options

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
options

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.760 
options
and<00:02:09.039> then<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.610> gameplay<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.899> gameplay

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
and then go to gameplay is a gameplay

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.520 
and then go to gameplay is a gameplay
let's<00:02:12.069> see<00:02:12.330> yeah<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.599> game<00:02:13.840> playing<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
let's see yeah it's game playing so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.339 
let's see yeah it's game playing so
gameplay<00:02:15.269> game<00:02:16.269> Pam<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:16.810> use<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> mouse<00:02:17.140> real

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
gameplay game Pam just use a mouse real

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.350 
gameplay game Pam just use a mouse real
quick<00:02:17.530> here<00:02:17.709> gamepad<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.459> then<00:02:18.940> gamepad

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
quick here gamepad and then gamepad

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.360 
quick here gamepad and then gamepad
layout<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.410> where<00:02:20.620> all<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.040> buttons

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
layout and this is where all the buttons

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.860 
layout and this is where all the buttons
are<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.000> particular<00:02:22.209> controller<00:02:22.720> so

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
are for this particular controller so

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.250 
are for this particular controller so
let's<00:02:23.019> go<00:02:23.110> back<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:25.120> don't<00:02:25.840> know<00:02:26.110> there's

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
let's go back and I don't know there's

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
let's go back and I don't know there's
any<00:02:26.290> multiplayer<00:02:26.739> games<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.430> progress<00:02:28.000> well

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
any multiplayer games in progress well

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.670 
any multiplayer games in progress well
let<00:02:28.209> me<00:02:28.269> just<00:02:28.420> go<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.599> continuum<00:02:29.290> real<00:02:29.500> quick

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
let me just go to continuum real quick

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440 
let me just go to continuum real quick
here<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.340> continue<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.030> my<00:02:31.120> save<00:02:31.420> game

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
here and continue one of my save game

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.140 
here and continue one of my save game
files<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:33.160> terms<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.760> controller

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
files so in terms of the controller

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.300 
files so in terms of the controller
because<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:35.319> did<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.650> trick<00:02:35.980> with<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
because we did that trick with the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.130 
because we did that trick with the
normal<00:02:36.670> hook<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.090> also<00:02:37.720> making<00:02:37.959> sure<00:02:37.989> that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
normal hook and also making sure that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.120 
normal hook and also making sure that
you're<00:02:38.470> selecting<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.099> X<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.879> input<00:02:40.420> 9<00:02:40.930> 0<00:02:41.500> 1<00:02:41.590> or

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
you're selecting the X I input 9 0 1 or

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.970 
you're selecting the X I input 9 0 1 or
1<00:02:42.280> 0<00:02:42.310> file<00:02:42.880> now<00:02:43.569> you're<00:02:43.810> right<00:02:44.019> analog<00:02:44.620> will

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
1 0 file now you're right analog will

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.020 
1 0 file now you're right analog will
work<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.340> I'll<00:02:45.430> show<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.580> proof<00:02:45.819> of<00:02:45.940> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
work and I'll show you proof of that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.030 
work and I'll show you proof of that
yeah<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.420> camera<00:02:46.720> is<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> work<00:02:47.500> with

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
yeah the camera is going to work with

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.059 
yeah the camera is going to work with
this<00:02:48.220> right<00:02:48.430> analog<00:02:48.730> joystick<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.769> show<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
this right analog joystick and show you

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.890 
this right analog joystick and show you
how<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.579> controller<00:02:52.030> will<00:02:52.209> work<00:02:52.239> proof<00:02:52.780> in

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
how this controller will work proof in

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.839 
how this controller will work proof in
the<00:02:52.989> game<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.739> now<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.950> ready<00:02:54.280> for<00:02:54.519> some<00:02:54.670> proof

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
the game so now you ready for some proof

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.270 
the game so now you ready for some proof
here<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.150> go<00:02:55.269> walking<00:02:55.660> here's<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.560> catalog

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
here we go walking here's a catalog

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.860 
here we go walking here's a catalog
joystick<00:02:57.790> look<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> camera<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.420> moving<00:02:58.540> guys

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
joystick look the camera is moving guys

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.490 
joystick look the camera is moving guys
see<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.799> see<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.130> pretty<00:03:00.549> cool<00:03:01.290> ok<00:03:02.290> now
