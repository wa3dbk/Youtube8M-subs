00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
to fold each sheet in half and it's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.590 
to fold each sheet in half and it's
important<00:00:39.020> to<00:00:39.079> get<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:39.910> even<00:00:41.110> as<00:00:42.110> one

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
important to get this even as one

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.450 
important to get this even as one
earlier<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.899> then<00:00:45.050> place<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.649> two<00:00:46.010> sheets<00:00:46.250> of

line<00:00:49.399> them<00:00:49.670> up<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:51.140> then<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.440> put<00:00:51.469> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
line them up so then you put the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
line them up so then you put the
template<00:00:52.340> onto<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.690> two<00:00:53.899> sheets<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.379> paper

the<00:00:57.710> folds<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.930> colored<00:01:01.809> paper<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.320> then

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
the folds of the colored paper and then

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.410 
the folds of the colored paper and then
carefully<00:01:04.840> for<00:01:05.840> paper<00:01:06.140> clip<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:08.090> finish

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
carefully for paper clip on to finish

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.289 
carefully for paper clip on to finish
into<00:01:08.720> shape<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.260> then<00:01:09.410> you<00:01:09.560> can<00:01:10.299> carefully

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
into shape and then you can carefully

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.830 
into shape and then you can carefully
ease<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.259> make<00:01:12.439> sure<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:13.790> one<00:01:14.390> piece<00:01:14.810> of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
ease it to make sure that one piece of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:26.910 
ease it to make sure that one piece of
paper<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.979> on<00:01:16.220> top<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.970> other<00:01:23.590> right

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.250 

you<00:01:27.880> are<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.120> ready<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.510> start<00:01:28.690> cutting

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
you are now ready to start cutting

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.120 
you are now ready to start cutting
around<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.070> template<00:01:30.659> hold<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.680> sheets<00:01:32.950> of

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
around the template hold the sheets of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.760 
around the template hold the sheets of
paper<00:01:33.340> very<00:01:33.580> firmly<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.479> take<00:01:35.170> your<00:01:35.350> scissors

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
paper very firmly and take your scissors

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.670 
paper very firmly and take your scissors
and<00:01:35.800> I<00:01:36.159> find<00:01:36.610> it<00:01:36.790> helps<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.720> take<00:01:37.930> relatively

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
and I find it helps to take relatively

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.940 
and I find it helps to take relatively
short<00:01:39.520> cuts<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.720> easy<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.380> use<00:01:44.619> your

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
short cuts and is easy to use your

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.969 
short cuts and is easy to use your
scissors<00:01:45.520> around<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.660> paper<00:01:46.900> by<00:01:47.200> moving<00:01:47.680> the

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
scissors around the paper by moving the

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
scissors around the paper by moving the
paper<00:01:48.220> rather<00:01:48.850> than<00:01:49.210> your<00:01:49.420> pair<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.810> scissors

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

template to the sheets of paper very
firmly<00:02:22.570> now<00:02:23.380> take<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:23.769> scissors<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.250> as<00:02:25.060> I

firmly now take your scissors and as I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.720 
firmly now take your scissors and as I
said<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.600> helps<00:02:25.959> just<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> make<00:02:26.500> very<00:02:27.310> short

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
said it helps just to make very short

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.199 
said it helps just to make very short
for<00:02:28.510> cuts<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.709> move<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.430> paper<00:02:30.730> around

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
for cuts and to move the paper around

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:46.470 
for cuts and to move the paper around
rather<00:02:32.079> than<00:02:32.470> tire<00:02:33.310> your<00:02:33.820> scissors<00:02:45.239> final<00:02:46.239> cut

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
rather than tire your scissors final cut

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.350 
rather than tire your scissors final cut
is<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.610> which<00:02:48.610> although<00:02:48.820> is<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.030> straight

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
is this one which although is a straight

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.509 
is this one which although is a straight
line<00:02:49.570> can<00:02:49.989> be<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> little<00:02:50.350> tricky<00:02:50.739> because<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
line can be a little tricky because you

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.060 
line can be a little tricky because you
need<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.940> hold<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.230> layers<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.799> paper

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
need to hold all the layers of paper

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.930 
need to hold all the layers of paper
together

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
together

quite

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.430 

we<00:03:04.670> now<00:03:04.849> need<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.269> separate<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> pieces<00:03:06.140> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
we now need to separate the pieces of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.490 
we now need to separate the pieces of
paper<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.980> start<00:03:07.250> weaving<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:09.050> take<00:03:09.290> off<00:03:09.470> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
paper to start weaving so we take off a

paper to start weaving so we take off a
paper<00:03:09.860> clips<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.610> discard<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.959> template<00:03:12.550> and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
then we have two pieces of paper and we

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.190 
then we have two pieces of paper and we
need<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.670> make<00:03:17.030> sure<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.360> they<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
need to make sure that they are the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.820 
need to make sure that they are the
mirror<00:03:18.680> image<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.459> each<00:03:19.700> other<00:03:19.940> like<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:21.019> and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
mirror image of each other like that and

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.369 
mirror image of each other like that and
the<00:03:21.950> fold<00:03:22.250> remember<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.239> long<00:03:23.420> bottom

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
edge to start weaving you take the first

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.220 
edge to start weaving you take the first
strip<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.940> right<00:03:29.150> hand<00:03:29.890> piece<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:32.230> place
