it<00:00:05.400> could<00:00:05.609> also<00:00:05.790> just<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.330> culture<00:00:07.400> or<00:00:08.400> it

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
it could also just be culture or it

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.140 
it could also just be culture or it
could<00:00:09.059> say<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> an<00:00:09.750> already<00:00:10.320> diluted

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
could say it is an already diluted

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.370 
could say it is an already diluted
overnight<00:00:12.150> potion<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.719> which<00:00:12.870> case<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.170> don't

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
overnight potion in which case you don't

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.279 
overnight potion in which case you don't
have<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.650> die<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:15.269> only<00:00:15.570> important<00:00:16.049> part<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
have to die the only important part of

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.800 
have to die the only important part of
all<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.859> knowing<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.480> diluted

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
all of that is knowing if it is diluted

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.620 
all of that is knowing if it is diluted
or<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.590> diluted<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.090> account<00:00:21.449> for

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
or you diluted you have to account for

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.359 
or you diluted you have to account for
that<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.900> your<00:00:22.230> calculations<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that in your calculations which is the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.560 
that in your calculations which is the
second<00:00:23.699> half<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> stage

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
second half of the stage

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.019 
second half of the stage
so<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.769> was<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.130> say<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.550> let's<00:00:26.820> say<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so if it was to say like let's say it

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
so if it was to say like let's say it
was<00:00:27.240> labeled<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> 1<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.039> 10

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
was labeled that this is a 1 to 10

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.420 
was labeled that this is a 1 to 10
dilution<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.689> overnight<00:00:31.050> culture<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
dilution of an overnight culture and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
dilution of an overnight culture and
let's<00:00:32.969> say<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> spec<00:00:33.660> reading<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
let's say we take a spec reading in this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
let's say we take a spec reading in this
point<00:00:34.380> 5<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.370> means<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.910> my

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
point 5 that means when I do my

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.670 
point 5 that means when I do my
calculations<00:00:36.780> afterwards

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
calculations afterwards

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.450 
calculations afterwards
I've<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.430> OD<00:00:38.910> point<00:00:39.329> five<00:00:39.920> times<00:00:40.920> ten<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I've got OD point five times ten to the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.750 
I've got OD point five times ten to the
eighth<00:00:41.809> because<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.020> e.coli<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
eighth because it's e.coli and then I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
eighth because it's e.coli and then I
need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> multiply<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.360> by<00:00:45.570> 10<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.980> was

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
need to multiply it by 10 because it was

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
need to multiply it by 10 because it was
a<00:00:47.190> diluted<00:00:47.450> sample<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.809> gives<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
a diluted sample and that gives me the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.090 
a diluted sample and that gives me the
original<00:00:49.829> concentration<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
original concentration so for the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.400 
original concentration so for the
proctored<00:00:56.969> half<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
proctored half of it I'm just going to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
proctored half of it I'm just going to
go<00:00:58.530> through<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> would<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.699> there

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
go through it is what you would do there

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.429 
go through it is what you would do there
will<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> selection<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.620> different<00:01:02.270> sterile

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
will be a selection of different sterile

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.179 
will be a selection of different sterile
items<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.589> front<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
items in front of you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.810 
items in front of you
they'll<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.580> water<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.659> his<00:01:06.810> tae<00:01:07.430> all<00:01:08.430> sorts

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
they'll be water for his tae all sorts

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.490 
they'll be water for his tae all sorts
of<00:01:08.909> different<00:01:09.090> things<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.780> only<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.350> you

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of different things the only one you

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.740 
of different things the only one you
care<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.950> though<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> LV<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
care about though is LV because the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.499 
care about though is LV because the
bacteria<00:01:12.960> been<00:01:13.439> growing<00:01:13.770> LV<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:15.119> what

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
bacteria been growing LV and that's what

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
bacteria been growing LV and that's what
you<00:01:15.630> need<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.380> control<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:17.130> did

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you need to use is your control we did

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
you need to use is your control we did
you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> account<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> color<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you have to account for the color of the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.640 
you have to account for the color of the
LV<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.509> my<00:01:21.509> sterile<00:01:22.170> lb<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> I'm

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
LV so here is my sterile lb and I'm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.330 
LV so here is my sterile lb and I'm
going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> pick<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:27.180> mil<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:29.130> very

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
going to pick up one mil and it's very

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
going to pick up one mil and it's very
important<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> first

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
important that I go just to the first

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
important that I go just to the first
stop<00:01:31.579> go<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:33.320> slowly<00:01:34.320> raise<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:35.070> thumb<00:01:35.340> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
stop go in slowly raise my thumb and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.770 
stop go in slowly raise my thumb and
then<00:01:36.570> take<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:37.220> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> second

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
then take it out if you go to the second

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
then take it out if you go to the second
stop<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.700> thumb<00:01:41.970> off

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
stop or if you just take your thumb off

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
stop or if you just take your thumb off
quickly<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> sucks<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.170> some

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
quickly and it sucks up some

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.710 
quickly and it sucks up some
indeterminate<00:01:43.740> amount<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.970> are<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
indeterminate amount you are going to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.020 
indeterminate amount you are going to
lose<00:01:45.899> points<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.920> blanking<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
lose points for the blanking because you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
lose points for the blanking because you
did<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.570> put<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.170> volume<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.710> there

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
did not put the right volume in there

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340 
did not put the right volume in there
and<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.149> watch<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> make<00:01:51.720> sure<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> pipette

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and we do watch to make sure you pipette

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
and we do watch to make sure you pipette
correctly<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.270> reset<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> pipetters

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.620 
correctly and we reset the pipetters
between<00:01:55.470> each<00:01:55.560> one's<00:01:55.799> that

between each one's that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.020 
between each one's that
what<00:01:56.810> you<00:01:56.930> need<00:01:57.110> them<00:01:57.729> sorry

about it

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.460 
about it
just<00:04:33.509> pick<00:04:33.720> one<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.080> looks<00:04:34.229> about<00:04:34.350> right

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
just pick one that looks about right

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.590 
just pick one that looks about right
