 have never been there but this i like that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.770
 so i've written a piece about it 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.770
 homosexuality 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.640
 and in sochi it was more like a hype 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.470
 but and from now on that home are Sweden 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.640
 search ', the problem is not gone 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.950
 that is why everyone thinks about it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 it lives on a bit and so on 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.180
 people are not being prosecuted in their own country 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.950
 and then it was so yes the idea that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.320
 I also am you later I stood 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.350
 paper and already some game where I am 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.830
 so okay maybe those two minutes 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.830
 to 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.720
 lots of choice enthusiastic 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.319
 they do n't want anything 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.390
 she a bit shy indeed yes she 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.890
 must both be on the stage name 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.840
 see how that will happen and have 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.430
 you already have your own task or something or is it 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.400
 just a whole in use 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.079
 I am one of the evil axis and I could 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.079
 on stage and then drag creepy 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.140
 I'm gonna do before he dies yes 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.510
 language I have written a piece of prose 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.530
 piece with the video and sound clips 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.530
 on the background 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.790
 in which especially the h 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.280
 oh man 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.280
 Yes 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.950
 say a train journey but they see it that way 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.420
 then you can compare one and life 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.730
 actually 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.700
 and such a whole train journey is a long one 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.370
 lives , say all humans animals 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.880
 encounters that there are people in your life 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.419
 and sometimes I have that then sometimes see 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.070
 me somebody and ok if it 's for something 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.920
 internet for youtube 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.970
 durk yes yes you are right who are you 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.160
 where are you from 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.510
 i am i am i church to get out of the kyron 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.930
 Rotterdam South Holland 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.890
 2002 mark no so that was what you got 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.280
 made 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.180
 And yes people buy a shit from one 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.150
 serial killer 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.510
 it does not sound very nice but 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.510
 so of this 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.800
 and it is inspired by the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.050
 mass culture only world epilepsy op 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.610
 the mentality of that time 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.080
 and it says it stands for people 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.939
 who do not want them looked at power and 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.490
 money and the objects 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.520
 moments yes right now we write and 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.819
 So hunt against people via the paint 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.819
 their life 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.120
 no but from that song of dance and what 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.950
 for dance you will do free duplicate 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.310
 budget implode nothing at all 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.180
 prepared yes okay but no slam 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.100
 say 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.060

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.920

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.430

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.570

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.010
 can see of that 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.010

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.969

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.289
