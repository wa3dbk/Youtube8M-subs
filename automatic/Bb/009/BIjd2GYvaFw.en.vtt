 Hello dear friends with you Larin 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.849
 and today we are starting to continue 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 undergo a training autosimulator version 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.509
 home version and today we will pass 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 task which is called movement by 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.210
 yard territory let's not 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.109
 hesitate and start to go through it and since 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.560
 I wrote on my channel that I 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 passing much parts of a table much 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.289

 I will break that is each task it will be 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.680
 Well, of course I think part of it will be 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.260
 better but for some reason it infuriates me that what is not 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:48.440
 engine stalls 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:48.440

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.840
 so it will be ok and so 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.900

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.950

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.760
