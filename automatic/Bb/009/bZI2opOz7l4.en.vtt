00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
gonna be is that but in like a heated

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
gonna be is that but in like a heated
version<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.240> suit<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
version you know to to suit the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
version you know to to suit the
environment<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.560> stuff<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.729> I'm

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
environment and stuff like that so I'm

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
environment and stuff like that so I'm
guessing<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> kind<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> hints<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
guessing what that kind of hints at is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.859 
guessing what that kind of hints at is
that<00:01:50.159> these<00:01:50.369> these<00:01:50.759> goons<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.540> thugs

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that these these goons or these thugs

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.249 
that these these goons or these thugs
are<00:01:52.200> gonna<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.030> what<00:01:54.329> mr.<00:01:54.750> Freeze's

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
are gonna be kind of what mr. Freeze's

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.740 
are gonna be kind of what mr. Freeze's
in<00:01:55.590> terms<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> fact<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.540> can't

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
in terms of the fact that you can't

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
in terms of the fact that you can't
really<00:01:57.899> damage<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.610> regular

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
really damage them with your regular

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
really damage them with your regular
punches<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> need<00:02:01.140> these<00:02:01.259> thermal<00:02:01.680> gloves

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
punches so you need these thermal gloves

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.080 
punches so you need these thermal gloves
to<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.460> like

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to you know like

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 
to you know like
I<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.750> maybe<00:02:03.899> they're<00:02:04.320> wearing<00:02:04.590> those

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I don't know maybe they're wearing those

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
I don't know maybe they're wearing those
those<00:02:05.100> those<00:02:05.430> suits<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.240> they're<00:02:06.450> wearing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
those those suits maybe they're wearing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.910 
those those suits maybe they're wearing
some<00:02:06.780> sort<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> suits<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.380> something<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.740> don't

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
some sort of suits or something I don't

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.190 
some sort of suits or something I don't
know<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> can't<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.580> think<00:02:08.849> exactly<00:02:09.840> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
know I can't really think exactly what

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
know I can't really think exactly what
the<00:02:10.319> reason<00:02:10.770> would<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.879> seems

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
the reason would be but that seems

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
the reason would be but that seems
somewhat<00:02:12.900> logical

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
somewhat logical

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.810 
somewhat logical
is<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.740> obviously<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.280> there's<00:02:14.550> gonna<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
is that obviously if there's gonna be

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940 
is that obviously if there's gonna be
these<00:02:15.000> heated<00:02:15.450> gloves<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.440> something

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
these heated gloves it's something

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.550 
these heated gloves it's something
towards<00:02:17.520> what<00:02:18.000> your<00:02:18.270> enemies<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.840> wearing<00:02:19.260> in

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
towards what your enemies are wearing in

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.120 
towards what your enemies are wearing in
terms<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.250> their<00:02:21.410> physical<00:02:22.410> appearance

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
terms of like their physical appearance

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.920 
terms of like their physical appearance
and<00:02:23.310> things<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> other

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and things like that and then the other

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.870 
and things like that and then the other
gadget<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.070> we're<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.580> getting

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
gadget that we're going to be getting

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.630 
gadget that we're going to be getting
this<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.270> uh<00:02:27.680> somewhat<00:02:28.680> interesting<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
this one is uh somewhat interesting it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.870 
this one is uh somewhat interesting it
is<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.600> thermal<00:02:31.410> batarangs<00:02:32.220> which<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.670> pretty

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
is the thermal batarangs which is pretty

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.130 
is the thermal batarangs which is pretty
much<00:02:33.650> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:34.770> what<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.060> electric<00:02:36.870> or<00:02:37.110> I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
much kind of like what the electric or I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.750 
much kind of like what the electric or I
mean<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.350> heated<00:02:37.800> gloves<00:02:38.040> or<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.520> thermal

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
mean the heated gloves or the thermal

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.210 
mean the heated gloves or the thermal
gloves<00:02:39.150> are<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.960> in<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.440> form<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.920> Batarang

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
gloves are but in the form of a Batarang

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.660 
gloves are but in the form of a Batarang
so<00:02:41.940> again<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:43.530> purpose<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.490> guess

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
so again the purpose of this I guess

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.880 
so again the purpose of this I guess
would<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.270> take<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.720> these<00:02:45.870> goons<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
would be to take out these goons and it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.780 
would be to take out these goons and it
all<00:02:47.010> depends<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:48.570> strength<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
all depends on the strength of them and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.890 
all depends on the strength of them and
what<00:02:50.790> they're<00:02:50.970> wearing<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.600> things<00:02:51.780> like

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
what they're wearing and things like

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.260 
what they're wearing and things like
that<00:02:51.959> like<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> armor<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.640> all<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> stuff

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
that like the armor and all that stuff

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.480 
that like the armor and all that stuff
so<00:02:54.330> I'm<00:02:54.900> actually<00:02:55.110> very<00:02:55.320> curious<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.130> see<00:02:56.160> what

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
so I'm actually very curious to see what

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.670 
so I'm actually very curious to see what
this<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.820> like<00:02:56.970> in-game<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:58.050> wonder<00:02:58.500> if<00:02:58.590> we're

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
this is like in-game I wonder if we're

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.230 
this is like in-game I wonder if we're
actually<00:02:58.800> gonna<00:02:59.130> get<00:02:59.310> any<00:02:59.520> more<00:02:59.730> details
