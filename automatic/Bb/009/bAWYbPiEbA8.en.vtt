 well equipped and spacious and recognized 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
 by the quality of finishing 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 technological generosity and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.150
 high-level driving 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 the pg 408 model 2014 arrives with evolutions 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 are marked by a new 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 suspension and transmission assembly 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.560
 automatic sequential six 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.439
 speeds 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.439
 allied to the 2.0 16-valve flex engine 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.960
 with 408 feline headlights retains the design 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.450
 elegant characteristic of the pejÃ´ the grid 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.610
 with chrome blades and the 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.520
 of fog lights contribute to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.410
 its dynamic lines the clean side 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.739
 highlights the style of alloy wheels 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.000
 and the rear has the design of the lanterns 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:05.360
 combining harmoniously with the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 generous trunk in your measurements 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.090
 the 408 has semi- elevated architecture that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.040
 provides the feeling of more space 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.110
 the elegant and stylish 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.850
 fluid and provides wide visibility 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.920
 to the occupants 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 the assembly that receives the dials is 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.750
 compact with the equipments well 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.550
 integrated the door panels and 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.970
 chrome details are not 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.979
 set of rectilinear shapes spaces 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.460
 make it practical to use 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.820
 excellent volume in the trunk are 526 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.820
 liters 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.630
 with the arrival of the line 2014 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.840
 408 went on to offer the allure version 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.820
 2.0 automatic with a new power train 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.429
 formed by the automatic transmission 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.399
 sequential six-speed 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.340
 available in the thp 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.420
 recognized the 2.0 liter 16 engine 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.789
 flex valves 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.819
 it offers 151 horsepower 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.150
 maximum and 22 kg force meter of 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.360
 torque at 4,000 rpm when fueled with 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360
 ethanol 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.459
 the six-speed gearbox was 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.580
 fully adapted to the curves of 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.250
 power and torque of the 2.0 flex propeller 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.980
 which also received amendments 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.890
 the result is greater comfort and economy 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.680
 but without leaving aside the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.290
 sports feature to make the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.959
 gear changes at higher speeds 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.959
 simply activate the sport mode on the exchange 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.750
 the new mechanical assembly presents 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.129
 even better performance in accelerating 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.860
 1 mile to city center 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.450
 the model is 1.4 seconds faster in 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.760
 comparison to the exchange of four 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.890
 because the transmission of six 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.689
 marches have shorter relationships in 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.959
 first and second gears 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.819
 the same occurred with regard to the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.189
 mainly from 80 to 120 kilometers 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.349
 per hour at which time was reduced by 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.209
 according to other highlights of 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.519
 transmission only a modern system of 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.319
 locking mechanism that prevents the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.500
 a gear is incompatible with the rotation 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.329
 and the dynamic correction performed 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.280
 when the electronic control perceives the 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.859
 type of terrain by which vehicle is 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.000
 passing the engine brake on and 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.000
 descent for example 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.689
 highlighting the excellent handling of the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.730
 408 the 2014 model received another 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.810
 important modification in the set of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.090
 suspension 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.940
 the rear axle were changed 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.549
 now softer joint sleeves 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.590
 and an elastomer wedge of the 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.540
 spring support with bodywork 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.090
 already on the front axle was applied a 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.010
 new spring top support which also 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.690
 contributes to better filtering 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.370
 floor irregularities 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.650
 details that have greatly increased the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.590
 comfort but do not change the 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.799
 characteristic stability of the 408 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.109
 now uses green pirelli p7 tires from 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.359
 low rolling resistance and that 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.320
 contribute to lower consumption and a 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.320
 smoother driving 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.340
 the latest generation security standard 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 408 remains active with important 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.830
 standard equipment such as air bags 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.370
 with six in the top of the range creep 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.820

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.620
 emergency braking to the effect 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.960
 flashes alert in case of strong 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.949
 deceleration in addition to the 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.229
 stability and stability 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.229
 both also in the griffe thp version 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.460
 with the renewal of line 2014 the 408 is 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.710
 offered in allure versions 2.0 16
