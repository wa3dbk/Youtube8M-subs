I'd give you guys a quick overview of
what<00:00:09.750> i<00:00:09.780> think<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> game<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:11.309> gameplay<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
what i think of the game the gameplay is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.089 
what i think of the game the gameplay is
a<00:00:11.880> lot<00:00:12.210> like<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> pc<00:00:12.840> vers<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.320> fact<00:00:13.830> it's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
a lot like the pc vers in fact it's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.580 
a lot like the pc vers in fact it's
almost<00:00:14.340> exactly<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.969> same<00:00:15.139> you<00:00:16.139> create<00:00:16.470> your

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
almost exactly the same you create your

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.810 
almost exactly the same you create your
set<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.859> that's<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.250> you'll<00:00:17.430> play<00:00:17.640> us

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
set and that's how you'll play us

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
set and that's how you'll play us
throughout<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> game<00:00:18.539> instead<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> using<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
throughout the game instead of using a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.529 
throughout the game instead of using a
mouse<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.369> move<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> cursor<00:00:20.789> around<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.359> map

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
mouse to move the cursor around the map

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
mouse to move the cursor around the map
use<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.230> analog<00:00:22.380> sticks<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.070> move<00:00:23.220> wherever

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
use the analog sticks to move wherever

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.939 
use the analog sticks to move wherever
you<00:00:23.640> need<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.990> my<00:00:25.230> opinion<00:00:25.380> makes

you need to go this in my opinion makes
more<00:00:26.160> sense<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.699> enjoy<00:00:27.119> moving<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> different

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
more sense I enjoy moving the different

more sense I enjoy moving the different

map but with good features comes the bad
that's<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> sims<00:00:34.020> are<00:00:34.110> doing<00:00:34.530> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's on how the sims are doing and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.319 
that's on how the sims are doing and
other<00:00:34.829> such<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.640> displayed<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
other such things are displayed on the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.389 
other such things are displayed on the
screen<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.200> brings<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.649> huge<00:00:37.890> gaping

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
screen this brings up a huge gaping

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
screen this brings up a huge gaping
problem<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.930> many<00:00:40.050> stats<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.649> put

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
problem there are so many stats to put

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
problem there are so many stats to put
up<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> screen<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.700> will<00:00:42.059> find<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> they

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
up on the screen you will find that they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.310 
up on the screen you will find that they
take<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.140> big<00:00:43.469> chunk<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> viewing<00:00:44.760> angle

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
take up a big chunk of the viewing angle

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
take up a big chunk of the viewing angle
because<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.340> doing<00:00:47.610> things<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
because of this it makes doing things a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.430 
because of this it makes doing things a
lot<00:00:48.180> more<00:00:48.210> difficult<00:00:48.809> than<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> be

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
lot more difficult than it has to be

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
lot more difficult than it has to be
that's<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> say<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> bad<00:00:51.270> game<00:00:51.750> no

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that's not to say this is a bad game no

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's not to say this is a bad game no
in<00:00:52.620> fact<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.340> heavily<00:00:53.579> addicting

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in fact I think it's heavily addicting

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.250 
in fact I think it's heavily addicting
and<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> people<00:00:54.750> would<00:00:54.840> agree<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.110> me

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and a lot of people would agree with me

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
and a lot of people would agree with me
other<00:00:56.129> than<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:56.670> aren't<00:00:56.940> many

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
other than that there aren't many

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.540 
other than that there aren't many
differences<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.140> pc<00:00:58.530> version<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:59.340> other

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
differences to the pc version one other

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
differences to the pc version one other
thing<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> karma

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
thing that was that it was the karma

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
thing that was that it was the karma
system<00:01:01.559> though<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> never<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.489> figured<00:01:02.640> out

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
system though I never really figured out

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
system though I never really figured out
how<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:03.840> anything<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.460> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
how to use it or anything like that it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
how to use it or anything like that it
was<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.939> useless<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
was pretty much useless to me and I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450 
was pretty much useless to me and I
never<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.439> figured<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.799> what<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.189> for

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
never really figured out what it was for

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
never really figured out what it was for
I<00:01:08.760> mean<00:01:09.240> look<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> go<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> bathroom

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I mean look here I go to the bathroom

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.929 
I mean look here I go to the bathroom
