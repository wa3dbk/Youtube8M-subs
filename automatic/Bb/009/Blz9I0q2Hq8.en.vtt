by the throat is a really diverse and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.630 
by the throat is a really diverse and
skilled<00:00:51.480> album<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.079> recommend<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> listen<00:00:53.460> to

it<00:00:53.820> however<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.539> latest<00:00:54.930> project<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.649> Ben

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it however this latest project from Ben

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.330 
it however this latest project from Ben
is<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.270> nearly<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.449> diverse<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.620> fact<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.070> think

is not nearly as diverse in fact I think

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.959

he very intentionally narrows his scope
down<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.809> synthetic<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.500> harsh

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.399 
me doesn't really have that strong of a
sense<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.310> place<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> mean<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> say<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
sense of place what I mean to say is is

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.699 
sense of place what I mean to say is is
this<00:02:07.649> record<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.140> right

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
this record I kind of just see right

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.580 
this record I kind of just see right
through<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.819> just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
through it for what it is just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.680 
through it for what it is just
pretty<00:02:12.769> transparent<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:14.030> uninspiring

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
pretty transparent a little uninspiring

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.380 
pretty transparent a little uninspiring
I<00:02:14.989> think<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.590> sounds<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.489> this<00:02:16.640> LP<00:02:16.849> as<00:02:17.180> they

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I think the sounds on this LP as they

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.540 
I think the sounds on this LP as they
are<00:02:17.510> presented<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.290> me<00:02:18.500> they<00:02:19.129> don't<00:02:19.310> really

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
are presented to me they don't really

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.600 
are presented to me they don't really
drive<00:02:19.970> me<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.769> imagine<00:02:21.769> or<00:02:21.950> really<00:02:22.250> feel

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
drive me to imagine or really feel

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.580 
drive me to imagine or really feel
anything<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.390> sounds<00:02:23.810> are<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:23.959> merely<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
anything the sounds are just merely the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.259 
anything the sounds are just merely the
sounds<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.340> throughout<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.819> duration<00:02:26.209> of

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
sounds and throughout the duration of

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.240 
sounds and throughout the duration of
this<00:02:26.390> record<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.870> me<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.170> kind<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> stay

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
this record to me they just kind of stay

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.740 
this record to me they just kind of stay
that<00:02:28.430> way<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.910> might<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.420> do<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.569> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
that way that might have to do with the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.289 
that way that might have to do with the
composition<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.530> these<00:02:30.620> songs<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.299> supremely

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
composition of these songs but supremely

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.140 
composition of these songs but supremely
I<00:02:32.480> think<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.840> has<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:32.989> lot<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.349> do<00:02:33.709> with<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.760> flow

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
I think it has a lot to do with the flow

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.479 
I think it has a lot to do with the flow
of<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.690> album<00:02:35.989> which<00:02:36.349> i<00:02:36.470> think<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.799> terrible

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
of this album which i think is terrible

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.920 
of this album which i think is terrible
there's<00:02:37.730> nothing<00:02:38.060> significant<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.780> my

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there's nothing significant in my

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.080 
there's nothing significant in my
opinion<00:02:39.290> about<00:02:39.440> how<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.220> tracks<00:02:40.519> on<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:40.879> LP

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
opinion about how the tracks on this LP

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.270 
opinion about how the tracks on this LP
complement<00:02:41.810> one<00:02:42.019> another<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.860> thing<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.160> me

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
complement one another this thing to me

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
complement one another this thing to me
really<00:02:43.459> feels<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.360> mixed<00:02:44.720> bag<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
really feels like just a mixed bag the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.900 
really feels like just a mixed bag the
first<00:02:45.440> half<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:45.890> LP<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.400> example<00:02:46.790> is

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
first half of the LP for example is

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.449 
first half of the LP for example is
loaded<00:02:47.329> with<00:02:47.420> these<00:02:47.569> whisper<00:02:48.260> quiet<00:02:48.680> ambient

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
loaded with these whisper quiet ambient

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.870 
loaded with these whisper quiet ambient
tracks

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
tracks

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.130 
tracks
I<00:02:49.940> would<00:02:50.090> actually<00:02:50.209> even<00:02:50.569> call<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.840> third

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
I would actually even call the third

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.589 
I would actually even call the third
track<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:52.250> LP<00:02:52.489> almost<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.150> field

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
track on this LP almost a field

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.539 
track on this LP almost a field
recording<00:02:54.230> not<00:02:54.560> only<00:02:54.799> are<00:02:54.920> these<00:02:55.010> tracks<00:02:55.340> not

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
recording not only are these tracks not

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.890 
recording not only are these tracks not
that<00:02:55.760> gripping<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.299> seems<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:56.660> they're<00:02:56.810> both

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
that gripping it seems like they're both

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.960 
that gripping it seems like they're both
really<00:02:57.140> too<00:02:57.410> short<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.890> elicit<00:02:58.250> any<00:02:58.430> kind<00:02:58.790> of

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
really too short to elicit any kind of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.690 
really too short to elicit any kind of
sense<00:02:59.690> of<00:02:59.870> calm<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.040> seems<00:03:01.220> like<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.459> only

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
sense of calm but it seems like the only

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.880 
sense of calm but it seems like the only
reason<00:03:02.299> these<00:03:02.690> songs<00:03:02.900> are<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.349> tracklist

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
reason these songs are in the tracklist

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.380 
reason these songs are in the tracklist
is<00:03:04.099> just<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.819> next<00:03:05.180> track

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
is just so that the next track

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.319 
is just so that the next track
immediately<00:03:05.959> after<00:03:06.379> them<00:03:06.530> can<00:03:07.069> bust<00:03:07.549> in<00:03:07.849> with

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
immediately after them can bust in with

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.330 
immediately after them can bust in with
an<00:03:08.450> incredibly<00:03:08.870> loud<00:03:09.110> intro<00:03:09.829> that's<00:03:10.010> ear

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
an incredibly loud intro that's ear

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.210 
an incredibly loud intro that's ear
piercing<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.239> comparison<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.230> volume<00:03:12.950> this

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
piercing in comparison in volume this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.130 
piercing in comparison in volume this
happens<00:03:13.640> from<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> song<00:03:14.120> flex<00:03:14.599> to<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.870> song

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
happens from the song flex to the song

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
song just turns quiet and slowly

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.690 
song just turns quiet and slowly

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139

about<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.680> closing<00:04:10.069> track<00:04:10.250> on<00:04:10.579> this<00:04:11.090> LP<00:04:11.299> -<00:04:11.630> and

about the closing track on this LP - and
as<00:04:11.870> far<00:04:12.019> as<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.200> song<00:04:12.410> secant<00:04:12.980> goes<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.639> song

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
as far as the song secant goes this song

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.190 
as far as the song secant goes this song
to<00:04:13.970> me<00:04:14.090> seems<00:04:14.359> more<00:04:14.569> focused

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
to me seems more focused

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.190 
to me seems more focused
there<00:04:15.530> are<00:04:15.650> huge<00:04:16.070> massive<00:04:16.820> drums<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.690> this

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
there are huge massive drums on this

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.620 
there are huge massive drums on this
track<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.590> rumbling<00:04:19.280> sub-base<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.329> rhythm

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
track and rumbling sub-base the rhythm

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.600 
track and rumbling sub-base the rhythm
on<00:04:20.719> this<00:04:20.930> song<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.289> is<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> chilling<00:04:22.099> reverb

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
on this song it is the chilling reverb

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.339 
on this song it is the chilling reverb
surrounding<00:04:23.240> these<00:04:23.390> drums<00:04:23.750> reminds<00:04:24.110> me<00:04:24.260> of

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
surrounding these drums reminds me of

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:24.550 
surrounding these drums reminds me of
like

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
like

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.210 
like
an<00:04:24.620> old<00:04:25.280> old<00:04:25.610> early<00:04:26.330> early<00:04:26.810> swans<00:04:27.260> track<00:04:27.830> but

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
an old old early early swans track but

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.770 
an old old early early swans track but
again<00:04:28.460> as<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.850> song<00:04:29.030> progresses<00:04:29.180> we<00:04:29.660> get

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
again as the song progresses we get

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.600 
again as the song progresses we get
louder<00:04:30.020> we<00:04:30.200> ladder<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.650> get<00:04:30.770> more<00:04:30.950> intense<00:04:31.280> and

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
louder we ladder we get more intense and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.270 
louder we ladder we get more intense and
we<00:04:32.389> end<00:04:32.570> up<00:04:32.690> having<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:33.080> track<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.590> once<00:04:33.919> again

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
we end up having a track that once again

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.420 
we end up having a track that once again
is<00:04:34.820> really<00:04:35.180> shrill<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:36.110> really<00:04:36.440> ear<00:04:36.830> piercing

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
is really shrill is really ear piercing

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.400 
is really shrill is really ear piercing
but<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:38.030> composition<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.050> distortion

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
but the composition that the distortion

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.550 
but the composition that the distortion
is<00:04:39.740> masking<00:04:40.340> or<00:04:40.520> over<00:04:40.970> modulating<00:04:41.720> just<00:04:42.230> isn't

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
is masking or over modulating just isn't

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.200 
is masking or over modulating just isn't
incredibly<00:04:42.830> gripping<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.669> kind<00:04:44.090> of

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
incredibly gripping it kind of

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.760 
incredibly gripping it kind of
underwhelmed<00:04:44.810> me<00:04:44.990> in<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.169> same<00:04:45.380> way<00:04:45.590> that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
underwhelmed me in the same way that

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.159 
underwhelmed me in the same way that
when<00:04:45.919> I<00:04:45.950> listen<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.550> let's<00:04:47.330> say<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> sleigh<00:04:47.930> bell

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
when I listen to let's say a sleigh bell

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.740 
when I listen to let's say a sleigh bell
song<00:04:48.530> it's<00:04:48.800> an<00:04:48.919> OK<00:04:49.370> pop<00:04:49.669> rock<00:04:50.000> song<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:50.600> for

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
song it's an OK pop rock song but for

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.510 
song it's an OK pop rock song but for
whatever<00:04:50.870> reason<00:04:51.050> it's<00:04:51.590> just<00:04:51.830> turned<00:04:52.160> up<00:04:52.400> to

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
whatever reason it's just turned up to

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.820 
whatever reason it's just turned up to
maximal<00:04:53.120> distorted<00:04:53.630> volume<00:04:54.050> for<00:04:54.320> a<00:04:54.350> bit<00:04:54.650> of<00:04:54.740> a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
maximal distorted volume for a bit of a

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.590 
maximal distorted volume for a bit of a
thrill<00:04:55.130> on<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.550> second<00:04:55.910> half<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> this<00:04:56.270> LP

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
thrill on the second half of this LP

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.480 
thrill on the second half of this LP
there<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:56.840> my<00:04:56.960> favorite<00:04:57.229> song<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.460> album

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
there is my favorite song on the album

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.879 
there is my favorite song on the album
Venter<00:04:59.210> another<00:04:59.630> slow<00:04:59.990> burner<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.530> picks<00:05:00.740> up

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
Venter another slow burner that picks up

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.270 
Venter another slow burner that picks up
some<00:05:01.100> wintry<00:05:01.430> drones<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.389> some<00:05:02.960> bells<00:05:03.290> along

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
some wintry drones and some bells along

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.620 
some wintry drones and some bells along
the<00:05:04.430> way<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.669> way<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.910> song<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.270> paced

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
the way the way the song is paced

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.270 
the way the way the song is paced
actually<00:05:06.139> reminds<00:05:06.440> me<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.620> like<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.800> moment<00:05:07.220> or

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
actually reminds me of like a moment or

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.879 
actually reminds me of like a moment or
two<00:05:07.490> from<00:05:07.760> swans<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.870> seer<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.440> while<00:05:09.740> the

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
two from swans the seer and while the

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.830 
two from swans the seer and while the
ending<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.400> song<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:10.820> noisy<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> do<00:05:11.389> find

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
ending of this song is noisy I do find

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.930 
ending of this song is noisy I do find
it<00:05:11.960> to<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.229> more<00:05:12.710> tolerable<00:05:13.370> than<00:05:13.639> some<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.880> the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
it to be more tolerable than some of the

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.550 
it to be more tolerable than some of the
other<00:05:14.090> tracks<00:05:14.389> on<00:05:14.690> here<00:05:15.050> but<00:05:15.290> even<00:05:15.470> the

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
other tracks on here but even the

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.409 
other tracks on here but even the
moments<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:15.919> like<00:05:16.190> on<00:05:16.400> this<00:05:16.550> LP<00:05:16.790> I<00:05:16.910> just<00:05:17.150> find

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
moments I like on this LP I just find

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.620 
moments I like on this LP I just find
them<00:05:17.540> to<00:05:17.690> be<00:05:17.889> wrapped<00:05:18.889> up<00:05:19.160> far<00:05:19.639> too<00:05:20.000> much<00:05:20.300> in

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
them to be wrapped up far too much in

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.800 
them to be wrapped up far too much in
their<00:05:21.139> own<00:05:21.350> chaos<00:05:21.950> like<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.669> explosions<00:05:23.570> the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810

that you hear on this record it's

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.270 
that you hear on this record it's

encased into the album and it really

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.219
