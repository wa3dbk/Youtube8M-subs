well the first thing you might notice

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.600 
well the first thing you might notice
about<00:01:08.660> this<00:01:08.840> game<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.410> it<00:01:09.590> looks<00:01:10.010> Senate

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
about this game is that it looks Senate

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.730 
about this game is that it looks Senate
sounds<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.810> feels<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.290> lot<00:01:12.410> like<00:01:12.620> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
sounds and it feels a lot like the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.620 
sounds and it feels a lot like the
previous<00:01:13.190> game<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.760> rescue<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.240> Dino<00:01:14.600> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
previous game the rescue of Dino and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.570 
previous game the rescue of Dino and
hoppy<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.860> think<00:01:16.130> that's<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.370> good<00:01:16.520> thing

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
hoppy but I think that's a good thing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.910 
hoppy but I think that's a good thing
because<00:01:17.000> I<00:01:17.450> had<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.930> lot<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.170> fun<00:01:18.440> with<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
because I had a lot of fun with the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.280 
because I had a lot of fun with the
rescue<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:19.970> Dino<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.300> hoppy<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.780> I'm<00:01:21.020> hoping

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
rescue of Dino and hoppy and I'm hoping

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.500 
rescue of Dino and hoppy and I'm hoping
you<00:01:21.410> did<00:01:21.590> too<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.850> there<00:01:23.000> are<00:01:23.119> some<00:01:23.300> key

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
you did too but there are some key

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.060 
you did too but there are some key
differences<00:01:23.750> between<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.500> game<00:01:24.770> in<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
differences between this game in the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.000 
differences between this game in the
previous<00:01:25.430> for<00:01:26.180> example<00:01:26.690> Barney<00:01:27.470> is<00:01:27.619> now<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
previous for example Barney is now a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.580 
previous for example Barney is now a
playable<00:01:28.520> character<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.330> as<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.500> would

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
playable character and as you would

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.890 
playable character and as you would
expect<00:01:30.650> he's<00:01:31.160> got<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.430> few<00:01:31.900> different

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
expect he's got a few different

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.320 
expect he's got a few different
characteristics<00:01:33.680> than<00:01:33.770> Fred<00:01:34.160> for<00:01:34.910> example

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
characteristics than Fred for example

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.050 
characteristics than Fred for example
fred<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.930> incapable<00:01:36.800> of<00:01:37.130> hanging<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.940> these

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
fred is incapable of hanging on to these

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.499 
fred is incapable of hanging on to these
flagpole<00:01:38.899> type<00:01:39.259> structures<00:01:39.920> because<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:41.180> as

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
flagpole type structures because well as

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.810 
flagpole type structures because well as
we<00:01:42.080> all<00:01:42.200> know<00:01:42.410> Fred<00:01:42.770> weighs<00:01:43.009> approximately

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
we all know Fred weighs approximately

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.200 
we all know Fred weighs approximately
487<00:01:44.810> pounds<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.649> clearly<00:01:46.310> such<00:01:46.700> structures

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
487 pounds and clearly such structures

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.529 
487 pounds and clearly such structures
would<00:01:47.390> not<00:01:47.570> support<00:01:47.810> his<00:01:48.170> weight<00:01:49.300> Fred<00:01:50.300> on<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
would not support his weight Fred on the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.210 
would not support his weight Fred on the
other<00:01:50.690> hand<00:01:50.840> though<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.680> only<00:01:51.800> one<00:01:52.070> who

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
other hand though is the only one who

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.510 
other hand though is the only one who
can<00:01:52.430> hang<00:01:52.940> on<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.619> edges<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.649> platforms<00:01:55.430> like

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
can hang on the edges of platforms like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.550 
can hang on the edges of platforms like
this<00:01:55.910> I<00:01:56.180> don't<00:01:56.690> know<00:01:56.780> why<00:01:56.930> you'd<00:01:57.110> want<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.410> hang

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
this I don't know why you'd want to hang

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.240 
this I don't know why you'd want to hang
onto<00:01:57.800> platforms<00:01:58.039> like<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.759> one<00:01:58.970> but<00:01:59.300> just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
onto platforms like that one but just

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.880 
onto platforms like that one but just
demonstrating<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> ability<00:02:01.789> for<00:02:01.820> you

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
demonstrating the ability for you

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.740 
demonstrating the ability for you
but<00:02:04.890> let's<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.609> what<00:02:05.789> else<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.329> another

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
but let's see what else is there another

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.910 
but let's see what else is there another
big<00:02:07.020> difference<00:02:07.439> between<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.770> two

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
big difference between the two

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
big difference between the two
characters<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> Barney<00:02:09.599> uses<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
characters is that Barney uses the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.309 
characters is that Barney uses the
slingshot<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.300> primary<00:02:12.300> weapon<00:02:13.200> of

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
slingshot as is a primary weapon of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.280 
slingshot as is a primary weapon of
choice<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.450> might<00:02:15.629> recall<00:02:15.750> from<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.200> last

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
choice you might recall from the last

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.150 
choice you might recall from the last
game<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.730> slingshot<00:02:18.239> there<00:02:18.569> was<00:02:18.870> a
