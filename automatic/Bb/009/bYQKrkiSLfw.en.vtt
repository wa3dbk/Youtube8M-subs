00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.070
 and welcome to one 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.770
 Another mystery video quasi one again 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.350
 Situation to be solved as always 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 will be a topic in our forum on it 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.080
 where you made your suggestions 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.160
 can score and yes we are natural 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.570
 as always curious who can solve it and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.730
 how many different solutions 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.020
 maybe found of course 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.200
 We will do that after a week or so 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 then dissolve and I'll just start 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.149
 Here's how it works again 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.829
 you have to win in this train we are 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.170
 at the train 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.059
 we have now and abt we have 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.879
 a life spot against 21 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.890
 Life has none but has none 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.949
 hand cards 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.769
 He has nine tagged plan what so 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.399
 makes something irrelevant then has on the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:05.080
 field two silverlight server night for 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.110
 two white men 22 with frost protection 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.870
 Banned relevant because our creatures 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.720
 all red are the one server has envy 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.250
 even the price tag created the 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.240
 equipment for five men 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.100
 that said all harmed him so 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.430
 would be added directly at the player 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.270
 instead of him he gets ripped off 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.580
 creature inflicted with it is natural 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.210
 a bit of a server full of protection 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.860
 So we can not have him in front of Roth 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.810
 shoot damage because of the damage 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.930
 silverlight would be shot and 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.700
 the war will not hurt at all 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.360
 then he still has a hustle and bustle 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.670
 again for two white men two of the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 says joseph roth that means the opponent 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.990
 he has not looked at us 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.120
 to be shared what the whole for red 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.280
 of course makes it even harder and then 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.390
 he still has a capped platinum 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.380
 angel in the field and the angel is 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.700
 stop flying 44 and say he does that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.229
 play can not lose and we do that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.509
 Game can not win that 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.690
 Of course , another problem or or 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.490
 a thing we have to get away 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.810
 we still have two cards the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.850
 The opponent's library also has two 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.670
 cards in the library that's like 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.490
 it is called irrelevant 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.550
 It is now about the parking situation, so to speak 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.840
 yes and then we come to the with the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.830
 we can act here, so to speak, we have 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 on the field of kabul dapd 3 lonely with 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.610
 first strike and hayes and with one 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.560
 The phases and capacities act 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.550
 then a damage to a creature the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.670
 players then shoot the eschen morgott 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.570
 for 39 44 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.960
 which can not block and then have 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.260
 we still have two dublin cubes for two 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.870
 painter is an artifact that says 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.550
 for three colorless and we could have 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.840
 the proportion of each type of painter we have 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.170
 in the pool have to double 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.000
 that is, colorless doubles red 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.880
 new black what else do we double 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.160
 just have red and colorless but 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.720
 so we can just double what 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.670
 We pulled ourselves into the pool 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.270
 we have 2 x that is to be considered 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.239
 the riddle 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.030
 then we still have ten mountains and 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.400
 twice what experts are clear 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.130
 and the mission factory will be for one 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.880
 partner of the month 102 2 asm blogger 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.019
 Artifact creature and remains a land 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.450
 we can get a pat it when we 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.050
 other smb walker creature course influence 1 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.410
 come to the end of the train then come 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.690
 We at our hand was the first one there 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.850
 the internet for ickx and a red one 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.019
 can hurt like a rick on a creature 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.570
 or send a player 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.620
 the creature on can train in this train 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.739
 be regenerated 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.030
 and if the creature in the letter 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.250
 would be sent 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.030
 she will be exiled instead 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.870
 then the calvin marias for two painters 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.430
 johann warriors 3 3 with vanishing 2 though 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.650
 they finally come into play harm 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.710
 and when when I hold in two 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.310
 still times coming down and if the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.830
 latest 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.180
 you have to sacrifice it that is down 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.800
 Here comes the game shooting damage 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.660
 is only 33 and if you are out of the game 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.060
 goes out she shoots another one 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.060
 then harm flat for three times a place 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.220
 like that said we can make a creature 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.680
 turn out to be in control of you 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.270
 get and the creature gets so 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.580
 quasi behind take over server 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.120
 and then we have such blast for 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:56.389
 six painters an instant that says 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.729
 additional costs to not checkout 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.790
 we all have to be the creature we all have 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.620
 creatures we sacrifice in a controlled manner 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.870
 and that will do so much harm 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.729
 a creature or a player like that 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.360
 entire wall of all creatures the ways 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.110
 driveway was potentially natural 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.110
 a lot of harm 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.470
 of course, there is this puzzle 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.000
 in it we work for the effects 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.350
 around the opponent so on the 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.790
 artifacts and on the tractors we have 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.100
 work like creatures around 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.890
 we turn off and out the effects 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.150
 all which cards do we play and 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.410
 which cards do not we play which 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.390
 We use effects 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.940
 as I said in this train 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.700
 it is of course possible to win 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.479
 you just have to figure out how to do it 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.930
 hires 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.789
 Yes and then 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.990
 have fun I say goodbye 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.990
 Until next time
