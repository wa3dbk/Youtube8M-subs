first<00:00:19.920> color<00:00:20.099> I<00:00:20.189> used<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.880> spanking<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.960> I

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
first color I used was spanking and I

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.910 
first color I used was spanking and I
used<00:00:23.010> my<00:00:23.400> mac<00:00:24.060> 217<00:00:24.480> brush<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.410> apply<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.710> with

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
used my mac 217 brush to apply it with

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740 
used my mac 217 brush to apply it with
it's<00:00:26.160> basically<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.060> soft<00:00:27.269> blending

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's basically just a soft blending

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.950 
it's basically just a soft blending
brush<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:29.130> applied<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> outer<00:00:30.480> corner

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
brush I applied it to the outer corner

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.050 
brush I applied it to the outer corner
of<00:00:30.990> my<00:00:31.169> eye<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.800> well<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.310> outer<00:00:32.460> V<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
of my eye as well as the outer V and

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.360 
of my eye as well as the outer V and
blended<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.990> words<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.650> crease<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> I

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
blended it in words into my crease and I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
blended it in words into my crease and I
try<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.580> use<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.850> circular<00:00:36.090> motion<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.750> much<00:00:36.900> as

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
try to use a circular motion as much as

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
try to use a circular motion as much as
I<00:00:37.140> could<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.980> because<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.280> helps<00:00:38.400> with

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
I could just because that helps with

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
I could just because that helps with
blending<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> makes<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> lot<00:00:39.690> easier<00:00:39.770> for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
blending it makes it a lot easier for

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.910 
blending it makes it a lot easier for
the<00:00:41.400> shadow<00:00:41.610> color<00:00:41.880> to<00:00:42.090> blend<00:00:42.620> now<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.680> didn't

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the shadow color to blend now we didn't

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
the shadow color to blend now we didn't
realize<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.310> spanking<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> limited

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
realize that spanking was a limited

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.050 
realize that spanking was a limited
edition<00:00:46.170> color<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.100> sure<00:00:47.310> if<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.790> still

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
edition color I'm not sure if it's still

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.520 
edition color I'm not sure if it's still
on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> side<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:48.990> I<00:00:49.050> didn't<00:00:49.290> realize

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
on the side or not and I didn't realize

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
on the side or not and I didn't realize
that<00:00:49.560> until<00:00:49.830> after<00:00:50.280> I'd<00:00:50.700> already<00:00:50.730> done<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that until after I'd already done the

31 and I used it for my entire lower
lashline<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.720> did<00:02:19.930> first<00:02:20.110> was<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.560> applied

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070

satin<00:02:21.520> sheets<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.390> inner<00:02:22.750> half<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.530> my

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
satin sheets to the inner half of my

satin sheets to the inner half of my
lower<00:02:24.040> lid<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.330> literally<00:02:25.660> stopped

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
lower lid and I literally stopped

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.740 
lower lid and I literally stopped
halfway<00:02:26.260> through<00:02:26.710> my<00:02:26.980> lower<00:02:27.430> lash<00:02:28.300> line<00:02:28.540> I

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
halfway through my lower lash line I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.400 
halfway through my lower lash line I
then<00:02:29.740> applied<00:02:30.570> spanking<00:02:31.570> from<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> outer

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
then applied spanking from the outer

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.760 
then applied spanking from the outer
half<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:33.130> my<00:02:33.760> lower<00:02:33.940> lashline<00:02:34.210> inward<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.230> I

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
half of my lower lashline inward and I

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.770 
half of my lower lashline inward and I
didn't<00:02:36.070> even<00:02:36.280> bother<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.610> blend<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.720> with

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
didn't even bother to blend it in with

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.960 
didn't even bother to blend it in with
satin<00:02:38.440> sheets<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.160> basically<00:02:39.520> stopped

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
satin sheets I just basically stopped

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.640 
satin sheets I just basically stopped
right<00:02:40.240> where<00:02:40.420> sat<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.750> she<00:02:40.900> started<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:42.160> ended

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
right where sat and she started or ended

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.380 
right where sat and she started or ended
the<00:02:44.650> trick<00:02:44.890> with<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.310> blending<00:02:45.640> though<00:02:45.820> was

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the trick with the blending though was

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.440 
the trick with the blending though was
that<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.750> next<00:02:47.020> color<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.620> used<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:49.180> blend

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that the next color that I used to blend

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.840 
that the next color that I used to blend
the<00:02:49.570> two<00:02:49.600> was<00:02:50.080> blue<00:02:50.290> Pacific<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:50.980> again<00:02:51.580> with

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the two was blue Pacific and again with

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.020 
the two was blue Pacific and again with
the<00:02:52.090> same<00:02:52.540> 231<00:02:53.320> brush<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.800> blended<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.610> right<00:02:54.910> in

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
the same 231 brush I blended it right in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.720 
the same 231 brush I blended it right in
the<00:02:55.120> middle<00:02:55.300> where<00:02:55.870> satin<00:02:56.440> sheets<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.040> blue
