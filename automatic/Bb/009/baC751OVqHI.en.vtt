00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 wow 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.380
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.029
 welcome to a new world of video of 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.920
 warcraft this time a video about a 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.110
 hyper hyper super mega awesome 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.550
 that they will install in park 5.2 and 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.950
 that will end up installing in the patch 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.869
 5.3 these changes in the system are the 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.580
 consequence of three problems that according to 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.559
 Lizar exist right now in the world 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.660
 per bp of the bug 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.460
 first of all early advantage the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.290
 players in the lead get the best 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.140
 game team much faster than the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.540
 rest 2 beginnings mid-season 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.610
 players who join late 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.230
 the current season of pvp face 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.489
 a great challenge to overcome since the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.190
 Most players have been acquired 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.199
 part of the team or the whole team and in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 third place index requirements the 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.219
 current index requirements create a 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.469
 artificial division between the players 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.930
 that are above the 2,200 points 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.760
 and the rest 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.620
 first of all he wants to make changes in 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 the search index this index is the 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.670
 known as mmr and secondly 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 wants to make changes in terms of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.310
 obtaining the pvp equipment and as for 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.350
 your point price one has been eliminated the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.030
 index requirements two k-2 for everything 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.790
 the team jc j that you're not going to have to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.380
 upload a team 3g its 35 that its five or 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.140
 scored battlefield 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.510
 to two k-2 second place there will be four 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.830
 object levels first the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 infamous and the malevolent that are those who 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.450
 we have right now with the changes of 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.520
 that the infamous will be created will be changed and the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.410
 evil gladiator including weapons 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.630
 may be purchased with honor points if 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.430
 finally the most pvp for honor is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.080
 will incorporate the new pvp set into the game 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.000
 that receives the name of gladiator 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.580
 tyrannical and there will also be a version 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 from the elite tyrannical creator though and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.780
 this is a very important change this 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.990
 elite team will not require a minimum of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.840
 index between its 35 pesos 5 and rpg but 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.390
 that will simply ask you for a minimum 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.160
 conquest points in concrete 27 thousand 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.640
 points of conquest achieved in that 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.440
 season 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.500
 small conclusion of this section 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.350
 good 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 from 5.2 the barrier will not exist 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.400
 of the 2,200 index points for 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.710
 get the best game equipment 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.720
 simply with your progression and with that 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.400
 you go playing week by week and go 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.470
 scoring will come a time when 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.090
 surpass that minimum of 27 thousand 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.980
 points of conquest achieved in this 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.080
 season and you will have access to the best 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.270
 team of game to elite tyrannical team 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.950
 so we have overcome two of the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.840
 three problems to be used and still 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.850
 right now in the tvpp the first 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.890
 early advantage and the second requirements 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.750
 of index we go to the third and last 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.340
 memory problem is the difficulty that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.110
 have the players that start their 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.670
 career produces so to call it at 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.780
 beginning of the season in front of 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 players who already carry all the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.170
 season playing and coming 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 acquiring almost all the whole equipment the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.860
 pvp set obviously use not going 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.270
 to stop rewarding those who are 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.620
 striving from the beginning of the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.120
 season but they also do not want 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 those who have not been able to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.720
 reasons start your career try the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.850
 beginning of the season they stay so 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.209
 back to no longer be able to reach a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.800
 high index in the pvp to correct 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.300
 this problem use has commented what 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.549
 next they will increase the amount 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.770
 maximum points of weekly conquests 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.270
 that players can acquire 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.430
 it will increase it in the following way 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.790
 if for example a player can not play 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.850
 a week of the season those points 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.440
 which are 2,200 is scored completely 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.020
 two thousand 200 points of conquest that 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.640
 lose then we will be able to recover not 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.830
 in its entirety but he will be able to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.990
 recover the next week imagine 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.180
 that we are in week 3 of the 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.740
 arenas season and why and that 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.390
 whatever you have not been able to score the 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.400
 last week that is to say you have 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 lost 2200 points of conquest that 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.020
 you got 2200 from week 1 and 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.630
 therefore your total number of 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.450
 points of conquest achieved in those 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.530
 first two weeks is 2200 well 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.330
 Well, this formula is proposed to use 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.570
 is the next current week of the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.700
 season is in this case 3 x 1000 in 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.260
 this case 3000 minus the points of 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.000
 conquest that we have obtained until the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.280
 moment of that season that is to say we have 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.209
 got only 2,200 points 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.530
 3000 minus 2,200 are 800 points that is 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.750
 that in week 3 in which you 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 you find now your point our 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.370
 maximum points of conquest that you are going to 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.019
 can get 2200 plus 800 is 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.269
 say 3,000 points of conquest can you 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.889
 get that week this is not going to be 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.320
 only a week will be all that is 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.330
 that if week 3 yes we get 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.130
 overcome so we managed to achieve the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.870
 3,000 points then in the next in the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.270
 fourth we will be able to get two thousand 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.889
 two hundred if for whatever in the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.240
 week three we did not reach the maximum 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.780
 so if not that maybe we 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.090
 we are at 2,500 and we are losing 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.530
 500 points of conquest, we will return 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.570
 to make the formula and we can get 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.330
 part of those 500 points in the fifth 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.040
 week and nothing else for now people these 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.740
 are the changes that are going to come with the 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.380
 patch 5.2 is this advertised even 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.270
 changes and updates for 5.3 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.500
 However, the use of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.300
 You can comment on this video because 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.220
 these are subject to a lot of 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.479
 changes if it is not at all clear so 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.570
 that when everything is more defined I will 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.950
 the changes also for 5.3 I hope that 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.540
 you liked the video I hope it 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.520
 everything has been quite clear 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.870
 wanted to stretch out a lot so you can 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.449
 the video again if you have any questions 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.750
 and nothing does not feel a hug and even the 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.050
 next 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.050
 see you later
