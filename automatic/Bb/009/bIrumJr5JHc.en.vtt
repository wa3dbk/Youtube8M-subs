people leave their mark and what's
really<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:18.979> being<00:01:19.520> interesting<00:01:20.030> about<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.450> is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
really but being interesting about it is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.170 
really but being interesting about it is
how<00:01:21.189> it'll<00:01:22.189> start<00:01:22.490> as<00:01:22.700> very<00:01:23.479> free<00:01:23.899> kind<00:01:24.259> of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
how it'll start as very free kind of

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.749 
how it'll start as very free kind of
patterns<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.799> then<00:01:27.799> as<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.369> becomes<00:01:28.640> more

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
patterns and then as it becomes more

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.340 
patterns and then as it becomes more
crowded<00:01:29.509> people<00:01:31.180> look<00:01:32.180> for<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.390> space<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.079> claim

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
crowded people look for a space to claim

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.950 
crowded people look for a space to claim
for<00:01:33.799> themselves<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:34.549> then<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.719> they<00:01:35.899> start

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
for themselves and then as they start

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.550 
for themselves and then as they start
crossing<00:01:36.560> over<00:01:36.740> all<00:01:37.399> hell<00:01:37.789> breaks<00:01:38.090> loose<00:01:38.560> so

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
crossing over all hell breaks loose so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.310 
crossing over all hell breaks loose so
well<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> child's<00:01:41.299> game<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.990> something

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
well it is a child's game and something

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.880 
well it is a child's game and something
that<00:01:42.469> can<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:43.060> enjoyed<00:01:44.060> by<00:01:44.270> anyone<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:45.350> also<00:01:45.530> is

than<00:02:25.909> 50<00:02:26.450> hours<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.810> intense<00:02:27.260> work<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.829> weaving

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
than 50 hours of intense work of weaving

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.380 
than 50 hours of intense work of weaving
that<00:02:28.939> doesn't<00:02:29.239> include<00:02:29.500> setup<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.769> design

that doesn't include setup and design

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.259 
that doesn't include setup and design
that's<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.629> straight<00:02:32.930> out<00:02:33.250> hardcore

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
that's just straight out hardcore

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.180 
that's just straight out hardcore
sitting<00:02:35.269> now<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.420> weaving<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.110> wanted<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.069> do

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
sitting now and weaving I wanted to do

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.880 
sitting now and weaving I wanted to do
another<00:02:37.310> piece<00:02:37.810> like<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.590> wanted<00:02:39.829> to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
another piece like that and I wanted to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.740 
another piece like that and I wanted to
do<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.370> specific<00:02:40.849> than<00:02:40.970> their<00:02:41.120> public<00:02:41.450> domain

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
do it specific than their public domain

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.920 
do it specific than their public domain
so<00:02:42.109> that<00:02:42.140> how<00:02:42.920> those<00:02:43.250> pieces<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.909> ribbon<00:02:44.120> got

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
so that how those pieces of ribbon got

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.289 
so that how those pieces of ribbon got
into<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.680> cloth<00:02:45.920> became<00:02:46.400> very<00:02:46.579> visible<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
into the cloth became very visible I

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.360 
into the cloth became very visible I
think<00:02:48.200> there's<00:02:48.349> often<00:02:48.650> no<00:02:48.739> connect<00:02:49.099> between

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
think there's often no connect between

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.240 
think there's often no connect between
how<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:50.299> design<00:02:50.780> gets<00:02:51.049> onto<00:02:51.230> fabric<00:02:51.739> in<00:02:52.099> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
how a design gets onto fabric in the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.390 
how a design gets onto fabric in the
public<00:02:52.579> mind<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.359> in<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:54.010> my<00:02:55.010> work<00:02:55.190> that's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
public mind and and in in my work that's

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.949 
public mind and and in in my work that's
very<00:02:55.639> important<00:02:56.000> because<00:02:56.090> all<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.629> designs

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
very important because all the designs

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.349 
very important because all the designs
that<00:02:57.049> go<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.319> fabric<00:02:57.970> original<00:02:58.970> pieces<00:02:59.150> of

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
that go on fabric original pieces of

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.670 
that go on fabric original pieces of
artwork<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.840> begin<00:03:00.049> with<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.470> there's<00:03:00.590> a

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
artwork to begin with and there's a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.309 
artwork to begin with and there's a
certain<00:03:00.889> amount<00:03:01.310> of<00:03:01.579> investment<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.359> time<00:03:02.629> and

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
certain amount of investment of time and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.349 
certain amount of investment of time and
a<00:03:03.560> process<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.400> process<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:05.090> also

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
a process and that process is also

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.649 
a process and that process is also
linked<00:03:05.930> to<00:03:06.190> technical<00:03:07.190> innovations<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.150> to

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
linked to technical innovations so to

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.680 
linked to technical innovations so to
have<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.079> in<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.379> public<00:03:09.739> eye<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.690> create

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
have that in the public eye and create

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.690 
have that in the public eye and create
awareness<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.230> connection<00:03:12.769> was<00:03:13.280> really

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
awareness and connection was really

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.670 
awareness and connection was really
important<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.120> me<00:03:14.269> there's<00:03:15.109> a<00:03:15.230> sort<00:03:15.590> of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
important to me there's a sort of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.879 
important to me there's a sort of
internal<00:03:16.159> logic<00:03:16.510> over<00:03:17.510> many<00:03:18.139> years<00:03:18.530> that's

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
internal logic over many years that's

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.460 
internal logic over many years that's
developed<00:03:19.579> around<00:03:20.329> that<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:21.139> know<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
developed around that you know in a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.979 
developed around that you know in a
sense<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:22.579> own<00:03:22.699> head<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.389> lot<00:03:23.840> of

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
of that and by degrees we formed this

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.990 
of that and by degrees we formed this
idea<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.860> maybe<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.370> work<00:04:49.550> could<00:04:49.819> be

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
idea that maybe the work could be

idea that maybe the work could be
collaborative<00:04:50.750> that<00:04:51.319> we<00:04:51.500> didn't<00:04:52.039> necessarily

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
collaborative that we didn't necessarily

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.520 
collaborative that we didn't necessarily
have<00:04:52.909> to<00:04:53.030> talk<00:04:53.270> about<00:04:53.479> the<00:04:53.810> experience<00:04:54.409> of

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
have to talk about the experience of

being<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:54.949> Iraq<00:04:55.370> or<00:04:55.849> Afghanistan<00:04:55.960> or<00:04:56.960> the

being in Iraq or Afghanistan or the

that<00:05:00.169> what<00:05:00.409> perhaps<00:05:00.860> we<00:05:01.069> could<00:05:01.250> deal<00:05:01.460> with<00:05:01.490> was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
that what perhaps we could deal with was

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.420 
that what perhaps we could deal with was
the<00:05:02.240> experience<00:05:02.719> of<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.229> aftermath<00:05:03.740> of

to the possibilities that come out of

to the possibilities that come out of

a lot of those are negative
possibilities<00:05:16.759> but<00:05:17.599> we<00:05:18.169> wanted<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.639> formulate

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
possibilities but we wanted to formulate

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.909 
possibilities but we wanted to formulate
a<00:05:19.699> way<00:05:20.030> of<00:05:20.330> addressing<00:05:20.990> some<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.289> those<00:05:21.560> things

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
a way of addressing some of those things

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.249 
a way of addressing some of those things
through<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.490> making<00:05:22.879> of<00:05:23.030> visual<00:05:23.509> work<00:05:23.750> the

in being didactic we were interested in

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.540 
in being didactic we were interested in
a<00:05:28.880> kind<00:05:29.569> of<00:05:29.719> bricolage<00:05:30.319> approach<00:05:30.919> of<00:05:31.159> bringing

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
a kind of bricolage approach of bringing

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.719
