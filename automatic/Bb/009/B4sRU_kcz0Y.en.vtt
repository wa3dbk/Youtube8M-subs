00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
concept and by the time I get it to to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.039 
concept and by the time I get it to to
market<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.939> feeling<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.659> need<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> be

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
market I'm feeling like I need to be

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.300 
market I'm feeling like I need to be
working<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> next<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.979> instead<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
working on the next one instead of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
working on the next one instead of
building<00:01:53.610> bikes<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.869> leave<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
building bikes so leave it to the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.330 
building bikes so leave it to the
professionals

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
professionals

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
professionals
and<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.509> guys<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> engineers<00:01:58.740> are

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and the guys there the engineers are

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
and the guys there the engineers are
kind<00:01:59.610> enough<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.060> able<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.299> Asian<00:02:01.140> aliy<00:02:01.290> let

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
kind enough to be able to Asian aliy let

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.710 
kind enough to be able to Asian aliy let
me<00:02:01.680> use<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> their<00:02:02.250> rear<00:02:02.460> ends

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
me use one of their rear ends

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.550 
me use one of their rear ends
yeah<00:02:04.230> that's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.610> big<00:02:06.020> hole<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.080> think

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
yeah that's a that's a big hole I think

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.950 
yeah that's a that's a big hole I think
it's<00:02:08.070> full<00:02:08.340> suspension<00:02:08.540> there's<00:02:09.540> no<00:02:09.690> chance

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
it's full suspension there's no chance

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.620 
it's full suspension there's no chance
that<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> custom<00:02:10.590> guy<00:02:10.740> can<00:02:10.979> keep<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> lab

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that a custom guy can keep up with a lab

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.050 
that a custom guy can keep up with a lab
of<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.470> big<00:02:13.680> company<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.670> changes

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
of a big company because it just changes

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
of a big company because it just changes
so<00:02:15.210> much<00:02:15.360> now<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.290> thought<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> thought<00:02:16.680> one

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so much now and I thought I thought one

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
so much now and I thought I thought one
of<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.130> big<00:02:17.700> weaknesses<00:02:18.120> was<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:19.170> know

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
of the big weaknesses was you know

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
of the big weaknesses was you know
everyone<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.370> knock<00:02:20.580> against<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.940> in

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
everyone not know knock against it in

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.240 
everyone not know knock against it in
town<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.210> reran<00:02:21.480> because<00:02:22.050> I've<00:02:22.170> had<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.560> but

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
town I reran because I've had that but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
town I reran because I've had that but
almost<00:02:23.430> every<00:02:23.790> bike<00:02:24.000> I've<00:02:24.180> seen<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.750> last

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
almost every bike I've seen for the last

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750 
almost every bike I've seen for the last
six<00:02:25.080> years<00:02:25.260> had<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.650> rear<00:02:25.800> end<00:02:25.950> yeah<00:02:26.490> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
six years had that rear end yeah and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.970 
six years had that rear end yeah and
it's<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:28.020> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> same<00:02:28.620> level

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it's kind of not going to the same level

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.070 
it's kind of not going to the same level
as<00:02:29.070> these<00:02:29.220> new<00:02:29.430> ones<00:02:29.640> right<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.720> looks<00:02:30.930> like

you were able to get another designer

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.120 
you were able to get another designer

here yeah mm-hmm if I would
this<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.250> wheel<00:02:59.460> off<00:02:59.640> wheel<00:02:59.910> size<00:03:00.120> an<00:03:00.270> option

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
this is wheel off wheel size an option

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.510 
this is wheel off wheel size an option
for<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.990> kind<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.230> full<00:03:01.440> suspension<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.160> mean

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
for this kind of full suspension I mean

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.800 
for this kind of full suspension I mean
they're<00:03:02.760> all<00:03:02.850> custom<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.690> build

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
they're all custom so I can build

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.850 
they're all custom so I can build
whatever<00:03:04.050> people<00:03:04.380> want

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
whatever people want

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.990 
whatever people want
uh-huh<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.700> I've<00:03:05.820> had<00:03:05.850> some

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
uh-huh and so I've had some

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
uh-huh and so I've had some
conversations<00:03:06.270> we<00:03:06.900> could<00:03:07.020> use<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> tallboy

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
conversations we could use the tallboy

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.560 
conversations we could use the tallboy
rear<00:03:07.860> end<00:03:08.070> run<00:03:08.489> custom<00:03:08.940> front<00:03:09.120> triangles

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
rear end run custom front triangles

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.760 
rear end run custom front triangles
around<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.590> my<00:03:11.070> personal<00:03:12.320> take<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.560> this

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
around that and my personal take on this

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.740 
around that and my personal take on this
and<00:03:14.070> where<00:03:14.190> I'm<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.790> next<00:03:15.030> with<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
and where I'm going next with this is

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.400 
and where I'm going next with this is
the<00:03:15.900> 69<00:03:16.470> because<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.610> think<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.140> 29<00:03:19.140> inch<00:03:19.320> wheel

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the 69 because I think the 29 inch wheel

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.810 
the 69 because I think the 29 inch wheel
makes<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.830> lot<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.010> sense<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.430> has<00:03:20.550> some<00:03:20.670> big

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
makes a lot of sense and has some big

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.130 
makes a lot of sense and has some big
advantages<00:03:20.910> on<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.480> front<00:03:21.720> end<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.989> bike

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
advantages on the front end of the bike

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.479 
advantages on the front end of the bike
right<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.650> far<00:03:22.860> as<00:03:22.890> increased<00:03:23.310> stability

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
right as far as increased stability

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.970 
right as far as increased stability
being<00:03:24.090> able<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.270> roll<00:03:24.420> over<00:03:24.480> obstacles<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:25.920> I

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
being able to roll over obstacles but I

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
being able to roll over obstacles but I
don't<00:03:26.190> necessarily<00:03:26.340> see<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.150> advantages<00:03:27.660> on

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
don't necessarily see the advantages on

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.600 
don't necessarily see the advantages on
the<00:03:27.959> back<00:03:28.140> end<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> bike<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.280> tends<00:03:29.520> to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the back end of the bike this tends to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.070 
the back end of the bike this tends to
weigh<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> little<00:03:30.060> bit<00:03:30.300> more<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.780> creates

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
weigh a little bit more and it creates

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.600 
weigh a little bit more and it creates
some<00:03:31.140> design<00:03:31.560> constraints<00:03:32.160> where<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> rear

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
some design constraints where the rear

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.130 
some design constraints where the rear
end<00:03:32.790> ends<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:33.090> being<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.630> bit<00:03:33.780> longer

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
end ends up being a little bit longer

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.400 
end ends up being a little bit longer
yeah<00:03:34.620> being<00:03:34.950> crowded<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.110> this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
yeah being crowded so that's the this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.229 
yeah being crowded so that's the this
bike<00:03:37.650> almost<00:03:38.040> ended<00:03:38.280> up<00:03:38.340> being<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.610> 69<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
bike almost ended up being a 69 but I

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.530 
bike almost ended up being a 69 but I
chickened<00:03:39.570> out<00:03:40.430> yeah<00:03:41.430> yeah<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.239> we<00:03:42.330> ended<00:03:42.480> up

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
chickened out yeah yeah so we ended up

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.620 
chickened out yeah yeah so we ended up
there's<00:03:42.750> 26<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> way<00:03:43.620> around<00:03:43.920> with<00:03:44.100> it

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
there's 26 all the way around with it

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.000 
there's 26 all the way around with it
look<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:45.840> well<00:03:46.200> that's<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.590> think<00:03:46.650> that's<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
look so well that's I think that's the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.920 
look so well that's I think that's the
keys<00:03:47.220> yeah<00:03:47.640> but<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.940> with<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> custom<00:03:48.269> build<00:03:48.630> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
keys yeah but it with a custom build is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.930 
keys yeah but it with a custom build is
you're<00:03:49.260> able<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.560> talk<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> customer<00:03:50.400> yes

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
you're able to talk to the customer yes

really get in there and now you have a
couple<00:03:52.650> choices<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:53.400> rear<00:03:54.269> ends<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.720> front

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
couple choices on rear ends in front

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.990 
couple choices on rear ends in front
ends<00:03:55.200> yeah<00:03:55.709> yeah<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.610> nice<00:03:56.760> thing<00:03:56.940> about

ends yeah yeah and the nice thing about
doing<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.480> tie<00:03:57.630> front<00:03:57.870> triangles<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.560> can

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
doing the tie front triangles is I can

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.250 
doing the tie front triangles is I can
really<00:03:59.010> custom<00:03:59.430> design<00:03:59.820> custom<00:04:00.330> tune<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
really custom design custom tune the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.660 
really custom design custom tune the
only<00:04:01.440> things<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.860> are<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.190> are<00:04:02.310> required

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
only things that are that are required

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.610 
only things that are that are required
is<00:04:03.180> you've<00:04:03.480> got<00:04:03.600> specific<00:04:03.810> locations<00:04:04.530> who

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
is you've got specific locations who

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.020 
is you've got specific locations who
wear<00:04:04.739> pivot<00:04:05.040> points<00:04:05.310> are<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.580> make<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.820> so<00:04:05.910> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
wear pivot points are to make it so the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.240 
wear pivot points are to make it so the
suspension<00:04:06.390> operates<00:04:06.959> correctly<00:04:07.140> but<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.040> can

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
suspension operates correctly but I can

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.040 
suspension operates correctly but I can
go<00:04:08.430> through<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.910> do<00:04:09.150> whatever<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.510> need<00:04:09.840> as<00:04:10.019> far

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
as head angle

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.880 
as head angle
top<00:04:11.710> tube<00:04:11.950> length<00:04:12.060> stand<00:04:13.060> over<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:14.560> be<00:04:14.650> able<00:04:14.740> to

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
top tube length stand over to be able to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.170 
top tube length stand over to be able to
make<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.340> customers<00:04:15.760> happy<00:04:15.940> with
