00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
much exactly what was in that case ed I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.320 
much exactly what was in that case ed I
mentioned<00:01:18.020> earlier<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:19.520> got<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.759> flatbread

mentioned earlier you got the flatbread
and<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.439> it's<00:01:21.590> triple<00:01:22.220> I<00:01:22.490> don't<00:01:23.210> know<00:01:23.270> if<00:01:23.360> I

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then it's triple I don't know if I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.700 
and then it's triple I don't know if I
can<00:01:23.479> unveil<00:01:23.689> this<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:25.189> just<00:01:25.250> cracked<00:01:26.180> black

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
can unveil this it just cracked black

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.800 
can unveil this it just cracked black
this<00:01:27.710> triple<00:01:28.130> stake<00:01:28.760> in<00:01:29.000> there's<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.510> three

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
this triple stake in there's a three

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.300 
this triple stake in there's a three
cheese<00:01:30.020> blend<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.590> there<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:30.980> that's<00:01:31.100> really

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
cheese blend in there and that's really

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.700 
cheese blend in there and that's really
it's<00:01:31.580> just<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.910> triple<00:01:32.390> steak<00:01:33.050> and<00:01:33.080> triple

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's just a triple steak and triple

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.370 
it's just a triple steak and triple
cheese<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.820> I<00:01:35.150> guess<00:01:35.300> we<00:01:35.540> can<00:01:35.660> get<00:01:35.780> right<00:01:36.110> back

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
cheese so I guess we can get right back

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.700 
cheese so I guess we can get right back
up<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:37.220> my<00:01:37.550> face<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.230> can<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.500> what<00:01:39.620> this

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
up to my face and we can see what this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.930 
up to my face and we can see what this
thing<00:01:39.860> looks<00:01:40.040> like<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.310> inside<00:01:40.400> once<00:01:40.850> we

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
thing looks like on the inside once we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.610 
thing looks like on the inside once we
break<00:01:41.150> our<00:01:41.330> open<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:41.930> like<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.170> said<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.440> minute

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:09.940 
was going to be our first bite of the
new<00:01:55.610> Taco<00:01:55.880> Bell<00:01:56.150> Triple<00:01:56.960> steak<00:01:57.260> stack

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.229 

so<00:02:10.580> my<00:02:10.759> first<00:02:10.970> impression<00:02:11.540> well<00:02:12.379> first<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.770> all

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
so my first impression well first of all

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.190 
so my first impression well first of all
there<00:02:14.239> was<00:02:14.360> definitely<00:02:14.629> plenty<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.989> state

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
there was definitely plenty of state

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.290 
there was definitely plenty of state
going<00:02:15.470> out<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.739> that<00:02:15.890> then<00:02:16.640> really<00:02:16.940> skimp<00:02:17.180> on

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
going out of that then really skimp on

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.880 
going out of that then really skimp on
that<00:02:18.879> for<00:02:19.879> six<00:02:20.060> bucks<00:02:20.120> they<00:02:20.480> shouldn't<00:02:20.890> my

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that for six bucks they shouldn't my

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.250 
that for six bucks they shouldn't my
first<00:02:22.129> impression<00:02:22.519> was<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.750> meat<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.080> really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
first impression was the meat is really

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.190 
first impression was the meat is really
juicy<00:02:25.000> steak<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.180> good<00:02:26.330> there's<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.080> good

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
juicy steak is good there's a good

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.650 
juicy steak is good there's a good
amount<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.470> cheese<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.830> there<00:02:28.510> well<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
amount of cheese in there well the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.960 
amount of cheese in there well the
stakes<00:02:29.900> fairly<00:02:30.349> flavorful<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.310> all<00:02:31.790> that

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
stakes fairly flavorful and all that

of<00:03:43.099> the<00:03:43.220> situation<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.450> cheese<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:45.019> getting

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
of the situation the cheese is getting

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.199 
of the situation the cheese is getting
thicker<00:03:46.720> which<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:48.079> if<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.790> cheese<00:03:49.970> was<00:03:50.150> a

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
thicker which I like if the cheese was a

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.309 
thicker which I like if the cheese was a
little<00:03:50.419> more<00:03:50.540> consistent<00:03:51.079> all<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.230> way

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
little more consistent all the way

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.509 
little more consistent all the way
through<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.919> I<00:03:51.950> think<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.310> would<00:03:52.430> have

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
through like that I think it would have

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.059 
through like that I think it would have
been<00:03:52.579> great<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.540> lot<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.260> steak<00:03:54.590> not<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.829> whole

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
been great a lot of steak not a whole

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.349 
been great a lot of steak not a whole
lot<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.250> cheese<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.760> cheese<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.060> kind<00:03:56.269> of

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
lot of cheese the cheese is kind of

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.900 
lot of cheese the cheese is kind of
disappearing<00:03:56.900> or<00:03:57.049> it's<00:03:57.169> not<00:03:57.290> existent<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.880> I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
disappearing or it's not existent so I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.390 
disappearing or it's not existent so I
feel<00:03:59.120> like<00:03:59.150> the<00:04:00.109> beginning<00:04:00.440> end<00:04:00.680> had<00:04:00.889> not<00:04:01.190> much

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
feel like the beginning end had not much

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.860 
feel like the beginning end had not much
she's<00:04:01.669> a<00:04:01.849> little<00:04:02.030> more<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.239> little<00:04:02.299> more<00:04:02.480> had<00:04:02.840> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
she's a little more a little more had a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.720 
she's a little more a little more had a
good<00:04:03.200> chunk<00:04:03.919> in<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.130> middle<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.549> end

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
good chunk in the middle and this end

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.640 
good chunk in the middle and this end
doesn't<00:04:04.910> really<00:04:05.209> have<00:04:05.389> that<00:04:05.419> much<00:04:05.660> again<00:04:05.870> all

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
doesn't really have that much again all

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.870 
doesn't really have that much again all
right<00:04:06.859> so<00:04:07.660> what<00:04:08.660> do<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.810> think<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.880> talk

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
right so what do I think of the talk

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.729 
right so what do I think of the talk
about<00:04:11.470> triple<00:04:12.470> stakes<00:04:12.709> tag<00:04:12.980> well<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:15.410> initial

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
about triple stakes tag well the initial

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:16.990 
about triple stakes tag well the initial
impression<00:04:16.160> was<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.519> price<00:04:16.729> is<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.910> little

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
impression was the price is a little

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.390 
impression was the price is a little
high<00:04:17.260> 595<00:04:18.260> for<00:04:18.530> this<00:04:18.650> thing<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:21.130> initially<00:04:22.130> I

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
high 595 for this thing so initially I

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.700 
high 595 for this thing so initially I
was<00:04:22.669> a<00:04:22.700> little<00:04:23.060> skeptical<00:04:23.599> over<00:04:23.990> being<00:04:24.260> worth

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
was a little skeptical over being worth

my mind or anything so I'd say taste
taste<00:05:58.969> would<00:05:59.210> probably<00:05:59.509> get<00:05:59.629> maybe<00:05:59.839> like<00:06:00.020> a

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
taste would probably get maybe like a

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.399 
taste would probably get maybe like a
sex<00:06:00.379> on<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.680> taste<00:06:03.399> the<00:06:05.020> flatbread<00:06:06.020> like<00:06:06.319> I

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
sex on the taste the flatbread like I

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.529 
sex on the taste the flatbread like I
said<00:06:06.469> was<00:06:06.830> just<00:06:07.039> doing<00:06:07.279> his<00:06:07.370> job<00:06:07.460> so<00:06:08.270> overall

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
said was just doing his job so overall

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:11.050 
said was just doing his job so overall
including<00:06:09.379> the<00:06:09.949> price<00:06:10.219> which<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.520> think<00:06:10.729> was<00:06:10.849> a

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
including the price which I think was a

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.480 
including the price which I think was a
little<00:06:11.810> high<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:13.250> flavor<00:06:13.520> was<00:06:13.639> all<00:06:13.939> right<00:06:14.120> I

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
little high the flavor was all right I

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.950 
little high the flavor was all right I

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
would give the Taco Bell Triple steak

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.249 
would give the Taco Bell Triple steak
stack<00:06:21.259> I<00:06:21.529> would<00:06:21.770> probably<00:06:21.979> give<00:06:22.430> it<00:06:22.479> overall

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.749 

I'd<00:06:27.259> maybe<00:06:27.529> give<00:06:27.800> it<00:06:27.919> a<00:06:27.979> six<00:06:28.129> and<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.370> half<00:06:28.399> or<00:06:28.729> a

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
I'd maybe give it a six and a half or a

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.639 
I'd maybe give it a six and a half or a
seven<00:06:29.180> it<00:06:29.659> was<00:06:29.839> good<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.080> was<00:06:30.319> just<00:06:30.469> a<00:06:30.529> little

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:30.649 
seven it was good it was just a little

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:33.219 
seven it was good it was just a little
pricey<00:06:30.949> and<00:06:31.219> a<00:06:31.310> little<00:06:31.930> too<00:06:32.930> straightforward

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
pricey and a little too straightforward

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:35.439 
pricey and a little too straightforward
I<00:06:33.860> think<00:06:34.550> for<00:06:34.699> something<00:06:34.969> at<00:06:35.089> that<00:06:35.240> price

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449 
I think for something at that price

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.300 
I think for something at that price
point<00:06:35.509> I<00:06:35.990> think<00:06:36.499> we<00:06:36.589> could<00:06:36.710> have<00:06:36.770> used<00:06:36.860> maybe<00:06:37.219> a

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
point I think we could have used maybe a

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.369 
point I think we could have used maybe a
little<00:06:37.460> bit<00:06:37.610> more<00:06:37.699> toppings<00:06:38.149> in<00:06:38.300> there<00:06:38.509> for

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379 
little bit more toppings in there for

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:41.350 
little bit more toppings in there for
something<00:06:40.129> this<00:06:40.639> simple<00:06:41.060> and

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
something this simple and

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.320 
something this simple and
straightforward<00:06:41.740> but<00:06:42.740> as<00:06:42.919> always<00:06:43.240> it's<00:06:44.240> been

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
straightforward but as always it's been
