have some give so what we need to do is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.160 
have some give so what we need to do is
use<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.650> flexible<00:01:22.520> plastic<00:01:23.330> primer<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.140> is

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
use a flexible plastic primer which is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.320 
use a flexible plastic primer which is
specifically<00:01:24.860> designed<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.909> have<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> little

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
bit of give so we're almost ready to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.830 
bit of give so we're almost ready to
apply<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.159> first<00:01:28.430> coat<00:01:28.580> of<00:01:28.729> primer<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:29.360> what<00:01:29.690> we

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
apply a first coat of primer and what we

want to do is lay the mirror down onto a
flat<00:01:32.479> surface<00:01:32.510> that's<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.049> best<00:01:33.320> position<00:01:33.500> to

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
flat surface that's the best position to

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.399 
flat surface that's the best position to
painting<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:35.330> want<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:35.810> prop<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.320> up

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409
