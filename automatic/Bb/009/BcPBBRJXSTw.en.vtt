to<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> machine<00:01:32.490> turn<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.329> into<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> rocket<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to a machine turn them into a rocket and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.039 
to a machine turn them into a rocket and
then<00:01:34.530> fire<00:01:34.829> them<00:01:35.009> at<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> huge<00:01:35.520> effigy<00:01:36.180> random

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
then fire them at a huge effigy random

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.499 
then fire them at a huge effigy random
but<00:01:37.470> quite<00:01:37.740> fun<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.700> stick<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> game

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
but quite fun if you stick with the game

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
but quite fun if you stick with the game
you'll<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:39.900> find<00:01:40.320> some<00:01:40.650> strategy

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you'll actually find some strategy

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.219 
you'll actually find some strategy
behind<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> mayhem<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
behind all the mayhem but you do have to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
behind all the mayhem but you do have to
forgive<00:01:43.560> quite<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> few<00:01:44.280> failings<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> get

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
forgive quite a few failings to get

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.359 
forgive quite a few failings to get
there<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.750> graphics<00:01:45.990> aren't<00:01:46.380> great<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.159> game

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
there the graphics aren't great the game

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
there the graphics aren't great the game
feels<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.909> rough<00:01:48.210> around<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.540> edges<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
feels very rough around the edges and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
feels very rough around the edges and
the<00:01:49.439> default<00:01:49.890> controls<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.579> just<00:01:50.820> horrible

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the default controls are just horrible

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300 
the default controls are just horrible
luckily<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> change<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> something

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
luckily you can change them to something

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100 
luckily you can change them to something
you're<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.610> used<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.390> still<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> won't

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you're more used to but still that won't

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690 
you're more used to but still that won't
help<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.740> car<00:01:55.920> gets<00:01:55.950> stuck<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.430> some

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
help you if your car gets stuck in some

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 
help you if your car gets stuck in some
of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> scenery<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.780> restart

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
of the scenery and you have to restart

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
of the scenery and you have to restart
this<00:01:58.409> stage<00:01:58.770> scenery<00:01:59.369> damage<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.969> also

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this stage scenery damage is also

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
this stage scenery damage is also
inconsistent<00:02:00.540> meaning<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.500> sometimes

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
inconsistent meaning you can sometimes

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
inconsistent meaning you can sometimes
drive<00:02:02.280> through<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> building<00:02:03.149> only<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> be

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
drive through a building only to be

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
drive through a building only to be
defeated<00:02:04.079> later<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> by<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> waste

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
defeated later on by a waste

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.100 
defeated later on by a waste
my<00:02:05.700> war<00:02:06.000> reversing<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.870> also

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
my war reversing is also

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
my war reversing is also
counterintuitive<00:02:07.830> because<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.520> steering

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
counterintuitive because the steering

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.969 
counterintuitive because the steering
switches<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> reverse<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> dev

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the single-player campaign it's also

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
the single-player campaign it's also
good<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.030> local<00:02:15.510> multiplayer<00:02:15.959> hasn't<00:02:16.350> been

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
good that local multiplayer hasn't been

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.140 
good that local multiplayer hasn't been
forgotten<00:02:16.590> after<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:17.730> where<00:02:17.970> its

forgotten after all that's where its

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
forgotten after all that's where its
roots<00:02:18.390> lie<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.380> still<00:02:19.590> play

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
roots lie so you can still play
