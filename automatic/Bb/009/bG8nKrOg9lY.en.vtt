about 25 degrees out here right now so
we're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> test<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we're going to put that to the test and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.140 
we're going to put that to the test and
it's<00:01:18.390> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> get

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
it's going to get

colder as the night goes on what we're
going<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.940> do<00:01:23.090> is<00:01:23.330> we're<00:01:23.510> going<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.660> try<00:01:23.870> to

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
going to do is we're going to try to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.470 
going to do is we're going to try to
keep<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.500> stoker<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.340> zone<00:01:25.610> or<00:01:25.940> that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.550 
starting and stopping is going to put it
through<00:01:30.910> this<00:01:31.910> most<00:01:32.150> rigorous<00:01:32.630> test<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.470> I'm

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
through this most rigorous test so I'm

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.920 
through this most rigorous test so I'm
going<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.710> set<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.040> stuff<00:01:34.250> up<00:01:34.460> right<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:34.910> and

going to set this stuff up right now and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.740 
going to set this stuff up right now and
we'll<00:01:36.410> get<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.920> thing<00:01:36.980> running<00:01:37.750> more

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
we'll get this thing running more

I've got the sensor there I got this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.980 
I've got the sensor there I got this
little<00:01:54.380> piece<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.830> paper<00:01:55.510> over<00:01:56.510> this<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.869> when

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
little piece of paper over this so when

I look at it I sit right there when I
look<00:01:59.300> at<00:01:59.420> after<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.690> window<00:01:59.900> I<00:01:59.930> can<00:02:00.170> tell<00:02:00.350> if

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
look at after the window I can tell if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.469 
look at after the window I can tell if
the<00:02:00.530> blow<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.830> really<00:02:01.100> going<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.850> comparison

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
the blow is really going and comparison

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
stoker up and find out what temperature

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.050 
stoker up and find out what temperature
it<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:13.459> through<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.730> will<00:02:13.940> go

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
it is really going through it will go

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.490 
it is really going through it will go
through<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.300> self-test<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.080> should<00:02:15.260> shut

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
through the self-test and should shut

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:29.680 
through the self-test and should shut
off<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.870> isn't<00:02:21.260> good<00:02:21.440> hold<00:02:22.070> it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.600 

well<00:02:30.460> it's<00:02:31.460> supposed<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.790> shut<00:02:32.030> off<00:02:32.210> oh<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
well it's supposed to shut off oh you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.490 
well it's supposed to shut off oh you
know<00:02:34.730> what<00:02:35.110> okay<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:38.170> check<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> trip

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
know what okay here you check the trip

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.170 
know what okay here you check the trip
control

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.119 

we're<00:02:49.719> having<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.140> same<00:02:50.319> exact<00:02:50.709> problem<00:02:50.950> we

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
we're having the same exact problem we

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.089 
we're having the same exact problem we
had<00:02:51.310> last<00:02:51.549> time<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.840> shut<00:02:53.079> it<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:55.799> turn<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.859> on

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
had last time and shut it off turn it on

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.190 
had last time and shut it off turn it on
again<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.629> should<00:02:58.870> shut<00:02:59.109> off<00:03:01.019> there<00:03:02.019> we

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
again and that should shut off there we

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.679 
again and that should shut off there we
go<00:03:02.349> now<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.430> behaving<00:03:03.670> properly<00:03:04.030> I've<00:03:04.420> been

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
go now it's behaving properly I've been

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.770 
go now it's behaving properly I've been
one<00:03:04.900> alarm<00:03:05.400> target<00:03:06.400> temp<00:03:06.670> we're<00:03:07.299> going<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.510> set

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
one alarm target temp we're going to set

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.300 
one alarm target temp we're going to set
to<00:03:08.760> get<00:03:11.370> down-<00:03:12.370> trejo<00:03:13.829> talk<00:03:14.829> about<00:03:15.040> cold

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
to get down- trejo talk about cold

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:25.740 
to get down- trejo talk about cold
smoking

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.090 

I'm<00:03:26.230> gonna<00:03:26.410> keep<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.010> 31<00:03:27.520> degree<00:03:27.880> range

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
I'm gonna keep it in the 31 degree range

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.540 
I'm gonna keep it in the 31 degree range
it's<00:03:30.100> pumping<00:03:30.640> right<00:03:30.790> along<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:32.490> now<00:03:33.490> we're

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
it's pumping right along see now we're

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.160 
it's pumping right along see now we're
looking<00:03:33.850> from<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.000> inside<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.630> can<00:03:34.750> see<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
looking from the inside as you can see I

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.810 
looking from the inside as you can see I
was<00:03:35.860> wrong<00:03:36.010> about<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> temperature<00:03:36.670> it's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
was wrong about the temperature it's

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.180 
was wrong about the temperature it's
much<00:03:36.970> lower<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.810> why<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:38.800> was<00:03:38.980> right<00:03:39.160> about

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
much lower that's why I was right about

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.310 
much lower that's why I was right about
it<00:03:39.490> it's<00:03:39.640> a<00:03:39.790> 25<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.300> guess<00:03:40.630> maybe<00:03:40.870> because<00:03:41.200> I

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
it it's a 25 I guess maybe because I

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.560 
it it's a 25 I guess maybe because I
just<00:03:41.380> taking<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.010> stoker<00:03:42.700> outside<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.420> still

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
just taking the stoker outside and still

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.840 
just taking the stoker outside and still
had<00:03:43.690> some<00:03:43.840> residual<00:03:44.290> heat<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.700> where

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
had some residual heat so this is where

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:53.990 
had some residual heat so this is where
I'll<00:03:45.940> be<00:03:45.970> staring<00:03:46.390> at

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.770 

you

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.710 

okay<00:03:59.780> got<00:04:00.080> my<00:04:00.260> Stoker<00:04:00.560> hooked<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.550> but<00:04:02.480> we

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
okay got my Stoker hooked up but we

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.800 
okay got my Stoker hooked up but we
already<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> problem<00:04:03.560> here<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:04.070> that<00:04:04.220> is

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
already see a problem here and that is

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.960 
already see a problem here and that is
the<00:04:05.810> target<00:04:06.110> zone<00:04:06.440> temperature<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.340> one

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
the target zone temperature is one

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.940 
the target zone temperature is one
degree<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.660> it's<00:04:09.530> about<00:04:11.230> 18<00:04:12.230> or<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.620> degrees

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
degree and it's about 18 or so degrees

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.800 
degree and it's about 18 or so degrees
outside<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.700> technically<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.420> should<00:04:14.450> be<00:04:14.660> shut

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
outside so technically it should be shut

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.570 
outside so technically it should be shut
off<00:04:14.870> but<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.380> may<00:04:15.800> be<00:04:15.830> because<00:04:15.950> this<00:04:16.280> was

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
off but that may be because this was

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.710 
off but that may be because this was
never<00:04:16.820> designed<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:18.430> maintain<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.760> 17<00:04:20.390> degree

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
never designed to maintain a 17 degree

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.300 
never designed to maintain a 17 degree
temperature<00:04:21.170> actually<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:22.040> current

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
temperature actually the current

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.770 
temperature actually the current
temperature<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.700> 17.9<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:25.180> we're<00:04:26.180> still<00:04:26.540> going

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
temperature is 17.9 so we're still going

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.460 
temperature is 17.9 so we're still going
to<00:04:26.870> do<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.200> test<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.720> we're<00:04:29.720> going<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.260> use

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
to do the test but we're going to use

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.930 
to do the test but we're going to use
candle<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:32.210> heat<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.540> sensor<00:04:33.520> all<00:04:34.520> right<00:04:34.700> so

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
candle to heat the sensor all right so

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.190 
candle to heat the sensor all right so
now<00:04:35.060> we<00:04:35.120> got<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.360> candle<00:04:35.960> or<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.950> sensor<00:04:37.700> there

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
now we got a candle or a sensor there

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.370 
now we got a candle or a sensor there
all<00:04:39.200> right<00:04:39.580> now<00:04:40.660> instead<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.720> programming

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
all right now instead of programming

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.200 
all right now instead of programming
here<00:04:42.740> we're<00:04:43.250> going<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.430> program<00:04:43.790> inside

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
here we're going to program inside

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.840 
here we're going to program inside
target<00:04:44.690> temperature<00:04:44.990> according<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.650> this<00:04:45.980> is

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
target temperature according to this is

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.120 
target temperature according to this is
one<00:04:47.270> degree<00:04:48.160> but<00:04:49.160> we're<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.610> 139<00:04:50.420> degrees

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
one degree but we're in the 139 degrees

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.410 
one degree but we're in the 139 degrees
and<00:04:52.130> climbing<00:04:53.320> I'm<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.890> say<00:04:55.420> that's

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
and climbing I'm going to say that's

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.480 
and climbing I'm going to say that's
cold<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:56.990> everything<00:04:57.380> will<00:04:57.620> be<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:58.010> 200

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
cold and everything will be in a 200

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.000 
cold and everything will be in a 200
agree<00:04:58.670> range<00:04:59.140> so<00:05:00.140> I'm<00:05:00.200> going<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.380> reprogram

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
agree range so I'm going to reprogram

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.420 
agree range so I'm going to reprogram
that<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.900> we<00:05:03.140> should<00:05:03.440> be<00:05:03.560> able<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.920> see<00:05:04.130> the

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
that and we should be able to see the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.120 
that and we should be able to see the
fan<00:05:04.670> go<00:05:04.970> on<00:05:05.180> momentarily<00:05:07.420> any<00:05:08.420> time<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:09.130> there

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
fan go on momentarily any time now there

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.150 
fan go on momentarily any time now there
it<00:05:10.280> goes<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:13.010> apparently<00:05:14.680> temperature<00:05:15.680> has<00:05:15.980> an

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
it goes so apparently temperature has an

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.340 
it goes so apparently temperature has an
effect<00:05:16.460> on<00:05:16.580> sensor<00:05:17.240> but<00:05:17.900> as<00:05:18.020> long<00:05:18.140> as<00:05:18.170> the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.560 
effect on sensor but as long as the
sensors<00:05:18.740> warm<00:05:19.010> everything<00:05:19.940> else<00:05:20.090> seems<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.420> be

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
sensors warm everything else seems to be

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.550 
sensors warm everything else seems to be
working<00:05:20.920> so<00:05:21.920> it<00:05:22.040> looks<00:05:22.160> like<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:24.260> problem

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
working so it looks like the problem

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.070 
working so it looks like the problem
they<00:05:24.830> had<00:05:24.980> with<00:05:25.010> software<00:05:25.700> or<00:05:26.600> whatever<00:05:26.990> it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
they had with software or whatever it

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.040 
they had with software or whatever it
was<00:05:27.260> was<00:05:27.650> fixed<00:05:28.100> just<00:05:28.670> exactly<00:05:28.850> like<00:05:29.210> they

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
was was fixed just exactly like they

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.170 
was was fixed just exactly like they
said<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.380> would<00:05:30.470> be<00:05:30.620> so<00:05:31.610> we<00:05:31.730> run<00:05:31.880> through<00:05:32.060> some

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
said it would be so we run through some

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.770 
said it would be so we run through some
through<00:05:32.420> some<00:05:32.630> tests<00:05:33.050> try<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.800> balance<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.310> out

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
through some tests try to balance it out

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.210 
through some tests try to balance it out
we're<00:05:35.780> going<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.930> try<00:05:36.080> to<00:05:36.110> get<00:05:36.320> this

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
we're going to try to get this

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.790 
we're going to try to get this
temperature<00:05:37.760> right<00:05:37.940> here<00:05:38.420> closer<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.650> this

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
temperature right here closer to this

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.790 
temperature right here closer to this
temperature<00:05:40.160> right<00:05:40.430> here<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:40.880> we'll<00:05:41.390> watch

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
temperature right here and we'll watch

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.570 
temperature right here and we'll watch
the<00:05:42.800> grid<00:05:43.810> go<00:05:44.810> up<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.140> down<00:05:45.320> as<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.800> fan<00:05:46.130> goes<00:05:46.400> up

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
the grid go up and down as a fan goes up

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.310 
the grid go up and down as a fan goes up
as<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:46.970> can<00:05:47.090> see<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.270> green<00:05:47.480> lines<00:05:47.720> represent

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
as you can see the green lines represent

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.050 
as you can see the green lines represent
when<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.530> fans<00:05:48.800> comes<00:05:49.220> on<00:05:49.430> i<00:05:49.460> finally<00:05:49.910> got

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
when the fans comes on i finally got

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.420 
when the fans comes on i finally got
these<00:05:50.270> things<00:05:50.800> stabilized

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
these things stabilized

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.910 
these things stabilized
there's<00:05:53.060> a<00:05:53.300> little<00:05:53.720> flag<00:05:54.020> going<00:05:54.470> up<00:05:54.680> it<00:05:54.890> should

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
there's a little flag going up it should

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.120 
there's a little flag going up it should
shut<00:05:55.280> off<00:05:55.400> my<00:05:55.430> material<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:56.390> there<00:05:57.130> starting

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
shut off my material get there starting

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.090 
shut off my material get there starting
off<00:05:58.450> and<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.750> reason<00:05:59.900> why<00:06:00.230> is<00:06:00.260> because<00:06:00.620> the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
off and the reason why is because the

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:14.910 
off and the reason why is because the
temperature<00:06:02.290> is<00:06:03.400> in<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:05.060> same
