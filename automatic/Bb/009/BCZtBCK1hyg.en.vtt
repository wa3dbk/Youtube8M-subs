00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.650
 that we notice in education is one 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.210
 and a lot of schools demand comes from 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.919
 teachers yes I can actually already 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.440
 be friends with my students 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.299
 facebook is that is not something of the 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.799
 the privacy are the managements too 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.970
 say don't do that are there 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.679
 say yes do that then you can do them 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.050
 check how your cake is 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.519
 taken for that reason certainly Lee 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.679
 and their 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.650
 I actually see no bones there and that one 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.119
 will do with it can give me a facebook 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.279
 also say whose knowledge and who 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.610
 are friends and who likes some of me 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.789
 see me there as a teacher 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.710
 have a lot of Rome for themselves 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:41.629
 as always while talking with your 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.390
 supervisor must be able to feel about it 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.949
 but then to say father's 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.020
 be friends to our 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.359
 also check again with the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.300
 Robbers how I think that indeed 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.170
 rain and a story is what we are watching now 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.140
 very fast one 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.300
 to that social media channels because 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.469
 which, of course, much more 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.079
 offer possibilities 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.640
 but I taught myself and I lived 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 in the back corner of a number of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 my students who could do very well 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.170
 see 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
 he had what they wanted and what my do 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.280
 and whether that is also easy with 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.530
 my contact can come 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.640
 that's the same but now virtual or 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.229
 is real 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.570
 You need to know where that you have some 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.700
 draws limits and limits and you have to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.530
 there indeed so rain that you both 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.720
 in reality and in the virtual 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.460
 world is also going to apply in you 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.829
 teachers working with students in it 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.899
 sports clubs sit that happens and that was 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.450
 then you go to a fitness and you quickly 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.159
 stands there on the by band to pull there 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.350
 you limit in what the name plan things 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.060
 so I think that's important 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.700
 You indeed say of there are some 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.619
 the limits that I want against but it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.630
 is a medium but you also need extra 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.270
 options do and everywhere in 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.219
 protect a number of cases 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.899
 I have soft on TV 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.280
 a teacher family that they are in until 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.810
 half past eleven at night lay with mine 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.159
 students chatting in it 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 to communicate 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.729
 yes then you have to be a bit yourself too 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.170
 protect to what extent secret therein 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.060
 but it is certainly an interesting one 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.520
 channel him too 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.989
 yes with my students and communication 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.880
 to enter and any additional 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.280
 provide support outside the school 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.870
 learn and on a platform that also what 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.870
 is easy and accessible 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.370
 also
