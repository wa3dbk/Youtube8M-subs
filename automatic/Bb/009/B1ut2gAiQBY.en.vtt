00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 Recently, it is not clear what device 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 what functions are responsible for example 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.430
 look at the tablet turns 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 phone recently samsung introduced 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 laptop 80 which is not only a tablet but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 if the phone is that it is able to call in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 Asusa also has an answer to the question how 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.690
 there must be a background pad this model is so 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.980
 called asus fonepad 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 or me371mg if to speak not the mayor 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.589
 pathological language and especially 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 by engineering so here 's the diagonal of this 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.829
 device is 7 inches 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.309
 1280 by 800 pixels works 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.729
 this device is running android 4 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.729
 one 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.520
 this is how everything is built on the base 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.030
 intel atom processor with such frequency 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.970
 1.3 gigahertz 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.120
 really well reacts to 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.120
 touch is naturally capacitive display 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 everything really works pretty fast so 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.270
 what's on the platform and there is some 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.640
 hope his memory is this device 8 or 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.180
 16 gigabytes is for content storage 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.270
 for operational data management 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.780
 RAM is used with a capacity of 1 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 gigabyte 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.810
 naturally supported 3g 2g is 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.810
 Wi-Fi 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 have bluetooth everything right 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:57.800
 The gadget is light in general for its 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:03.440
 sizes made of plastic 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.670
 incomprehensible color of golden rather on 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 the left side has a power button 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.870
 volume control for some reason below 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.280
 audio jack and microusb port 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.280
 but also a microphone 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.710
 Well, of course the front speaker to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.740
 so here apply the device to your ear and 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.500
 look like a strange person 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.390
 I would not be enough on the street myself 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.010
 I applied to the kitchen I would use 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
 headsets but again use 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.010
 headset battery charge will be 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.690
 to spend 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.260
 fast enough battery charge here 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.740
 4270 milliampere hour that I don't even know 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.970
 much or little while we know little about 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:54.180
 platform intel atom mobile therefore 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:58.230
 unclearly stated that the device can 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.300
 work up to 9 hours in hardcore mode 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.190
 use with internet calls and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.150
 Other and other and easier in principle 9 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.310
 hours is not bad but perhaps from the tablet 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.980
 I would like more 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.400
 Here is such an asus fonepad at the exhibition 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.900
 two you 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.900
 mbc 2013 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.099
 I look 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.330
 but mobile
