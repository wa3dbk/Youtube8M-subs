00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hi, welcome to the channel of which 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.170
 taker 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.360
 Are you seeing the result of the last 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 partial exchange of water I made a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 lightweight glass cleaning as well as 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 last is exchange for something that I did 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 Are you seeing the date just below that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.910
 does not remember the government video now but 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 certainly there is a very high time like this. 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 pro average staff use 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 it was a doubt that appeared on youtube 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.520
 on Facebook in the last days on the networks 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.380
 with the company 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.030
 then you will see that the result of the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.070
 tests I did before changing the water 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 you can see here the nitrite test of 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.559
 0.25 ph7 I'm going to take a little bit of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.379
 shell that I keep in the video at no 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.149
 filter always to take ph and ammonia 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 of I think 0.50 what does not catch on 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.879
 current temperature is not toxic to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 fish 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.710
 the oxygen test that I got 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.540
 purchase also now paid off 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 between 0.60 and excuse between 66 and 80 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.780
 very good level 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 it is that the CO2 in the aquarium but it 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.220
 does not interfere with anything because exposure 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.159
 and produce more oxygen 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.479
 the current state of co2 you can see 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.439
 here it lasts for so long that the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 to non-bacterial colonies. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.350
 reached the bottom of the liter of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 bacteria are actually the colonies of the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 yeast 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.770
 so you can see here maybe 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.110
 Arrived on the phone is halfway there. 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 the cold also favors the delay 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.740
 a little more the heat is faster 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 but the main thing I wanna show 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.500
 You are not today, these are the reasons 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:58.350
 I'm using that to ask me 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:03.659
 come on let's start with the main 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.869
 Tropical reason that where the vit 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.509
 I put a little 8 plus eight of the type 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.280
 Also flakes of 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:18.060
 tropical is the second here are dafne 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.010
 the to be treated in the tropical despite 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.049
 be changed to the team I buy in 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.970
 sachet enjoy the sporting I already have 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.370
 this reaction at the moment I'm not using 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.230
 because I found more to buy or 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.940
 sell a chat that she will stop being 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.599
 sold but I do not believe it much 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.659
 It 's tropical too, very good. 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.180
 here 's a mix I like 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.750
 use once a week with feed 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.109
 with alcohol and fish feed. 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.639
 tropical lake is mainly the 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.670
 neons really like all 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.389
 researchers do not eat very well but 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.090
 I know it's not a reason to be 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.569
 to use a variation every day there is that 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.609
 I use the tropical I injected or also a 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.810
 reason they like but is not indicated 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.750
 for all kinds of fish I 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.190
 I have in the aquarium is more a good reason 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.590
 was on sale when I bought it 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.750
 so I ended up taking and this victory 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.750
 collor also in tropical milk 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.910
 tomorrow flakes for those who use samp with 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.919
 She 's kind of complicated because she 's a 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.660
 very difficult to make sink 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.590
 have to hold her here a little bit 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.540
 This is how it is held here until it softens. 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.310
 to go back to sink and even 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.470
 so a part of it in the sling 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.470
 these are the five of consignments that 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 I'm currently using but does not 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.590
 you can use other types 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.510
 it is also important to maintain a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.319
 variability with rations of 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.319
 quality 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.699
 It's also important that you're the case. 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.849
 have the condition is today also an 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.709
 bracho 11 a reason me with a 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.629
 very nice complement because it is 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.669
 It's difficult for you to create the 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.129
 run as I also get a 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.870
 It's a little difficult because China's 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.819
 they do not have as much interest in 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.049
 dehydrated and in finance and tma 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.150
 still alive or even frozen and 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.430
 also you can use for husbands 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.130
 cleaner as I always use the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.900
 cucumber is the cucumber is a complement 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.740
 Nice, they love it and it's rich in a tv. 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.139
 that fibrous 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.270
 they need to they do not do that 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.970
 using there doing with my plant 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.919
 back even thinks them 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.139
 they end up giving this detonated 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.389
 some plants there that they have 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:41.250
 preferably the cascudinho 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.990
 the Chinese algae eaters I 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.699
 I have some food there eating seaweed 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.910
 Unfortunately I can not I'm not 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.650
 managing to control 100% I believe 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.550
 that this is due to the fact that this window 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.979
 here is a lot of street light is here 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.169
 in the home and this also 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.819
 propagation of algae because the other 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.340
 aquarium that I have I'll start 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.349
 to show you that other one too 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.289
 aquarium he does not develop as much 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.750
 how much alcohol is developed and 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.520
 classes that develops or is not 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.380
 develops nothing politically then I 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.159
 I have it because of this light that comes 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.250
 from the street too 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:20.039
 only that it has - fertile substrate then 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.860
 has a relationship and also only that I have 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.449
 less plants also also thing that 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.610
 I forgot to talk here to ask me 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.580
 these days put in the comments 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.800
 poor of the neons with so much current 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.419
 people wanted you to be the reason now 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.419
 that it is floating you can see 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.219
 There is no current of mine now. 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.750
 very light to the current nothing 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.810
 upset the neons side he gets 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.210
 Stop without work, no one can see it. 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.389
 unity 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.690
 water is out of the filter or several 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.150
 little holes in the corner 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.430
 many had spread santis not 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.330
 only our difficulty does not have 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.800
 current on the court always looking for the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.280
 best possible condition 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.469
 the inhabitants of the same gang then 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.090
 this guys is no way to continue 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.000
 following the channel of which he is amateur 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.219
 like in the video and sign up for 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.440
 channel for us to continue making videos 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.360
 quality and I will try to climb the 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.699
 quality with a series of new videos 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.099
 explaining from the filter analyze the 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:26.759
 types of aquarium filtering types 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:30.650
 fish and lighting plant substrates 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:34.520
 All right, mind is and let's go. 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.520
 accompanying the channel there guys 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.039
 as I changed now they are little 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.659
 religious divine ration can see that 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:51.129
 they are coming very slowly as usual 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:54.090
 they come to eat on the hand with a voracity 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:54.090
 incredible
