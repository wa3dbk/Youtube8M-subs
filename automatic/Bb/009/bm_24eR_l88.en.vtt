start the test

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.749 
start the test
when<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.180> call<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.630> something<00:02:08.930> just<00:02:09.830> make<00:02:10.729> a

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
when you call it something just make a

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.990 
when you call it something just make a
name<00:02:11.090> bracelet<00:02:11.660> three<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:13.010> now<00:02:13.640> what's

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
name bracelet three and now what's

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 
name bracelet three and now what's
happening<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.810> instrument<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.500> sending<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
happening is the instrument is sending a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.030 
happening is the instrument is sending a
really<00:02:16.730> fine<00:02:17.300> beam<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.990> x-rays<00:02:18.140> at<00:02:18.770> your

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
really fine beam of x-rays at your

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.530 
really fine beam of x-rays at your
bracelet<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:22.070> excites<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.970> molecules

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
bracelet and that excites the molecules

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.890 
bracelet and that excites the molecules
in<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.190> bracelet<00:02:25.190> which<00:02:25.520> move<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.720> higher

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
in the bracelet which move to a higher

their normal energy state they emit

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.780 
their normal energy state they emit
radiation<00:02:32.030> at<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:32.810> characteristic

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
radiation at a very characteristic

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.280 
radiation at a very characteristic
frequency<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:35.270> what<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.690> detector

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
frequency and that's what the detector

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.800 
frequency and that's what the detector
in<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.530> machine<00:02:36.890> reads<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.270> tells<00:02:38.600> us

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
in the machine reads and that tells us

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.790 
in the machine reads and that tells us
precisely<00:02:39.380> what<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> items<00:02:40.400> made<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
precisely what the items made of and

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.520 
precisely what the items made of and
what<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:43.280> telling<00:02:43.490> us<00:02:43.790> today<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:45.350> this

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
what it's telling us today is it this

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.580 
what it's telling us today is it this
item<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.070> would<00:02:46.250> normally<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.910> would<00:02:47.090> be<00:02:47.240> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
item it would normally this would be a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.740 
item it would normally this would be a
14-karat<00:02:48.590> gold<00:02:49.090> bracelet<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.510> actually

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
14-karat gold bracelet but it actually

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.199 
14-karat gold bracelet but it actually
has<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.140> little<00:02:51.650> bit<00:02:51.800> more<00:02:52.010> gold<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.940> in

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
has a little bit more gold than that in

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.770 
has a little bit more gold than that in
it<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.870> says<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.620> machine<00:02:54.920> says<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.340> has

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it that says the machine says it has

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.120 
it that says the machine says it has
14.2<00:02:56.780> 9<00:02:57.020> 82<00:02:57.590> carats<00:02:58.490> worth<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.150> gold<00:02:59.360> in<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.690> so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
14.2 9 82 carats worth of gold in it so

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.970 
14.2 9 82 carats worth of gold in it so
14.3<00:03:01.130> carats<00:03:01.580> roughly<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.270> that<00:03:02.980> exact

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
14.3 carats roughly and that exact

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.040 
14.3 carats roughly and that exact
amount<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.550> gold<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:05.030> what<00:03:05.209> we<00:03:05.360> will<00:03:05.540> base<00:03:05.780> our

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
amount of gold is what we will base our

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
amount of gold is what we will base our
offer<00:03:06.560> price<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.490> this<00:03:07.610> item<00:03:07.820> on<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.070> very

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
offer price for this item on so very

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.460 
offer price for this item on so very
often<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.820> gold<00:03:11.150> content<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.900> little<00:03:12.290> more

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
often the gold content is a little more

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.040 
often the gold content is a little more
they<00:03:12.739> err<00:03:13.040> on<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> on<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.000> plus<00:03:14.420> side<00:03:14.690> there

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
they err on the on the plus side there

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.729 
they err on the on the plus side there
then<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.550> minimum<00:03:17.540> required<00:03:17.959> for<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.350> carat

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
then the minimum required for the carat

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.170 
then the minimum required for the carat
weight<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.430> we<00:03:20.269> pay<00:03:20.570> for<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:20.989> extra<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.790> next

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
weight so we pay for that extra the next

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.090 
weight so we pay for that extra the next
step<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.900> save<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.680> data<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.310> report

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
step is to save this data as a report

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:34.270 
step is to save this data as a report
which<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.340> will<00:03:28.519> do<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:32.650> while<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.800> reports

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
which we will do and while the reports

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.960 
which we will do and while the reports
building<00:03:34.760> we<00:03:35.090> take<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:35.950> bracelet<00:03:36.950> now<00:03:37.250> and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
building we take your bracelet now and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.970 
building we take your bracelet now and
we<00:03:38.150> need<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.360> get<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.630> weight<00:03:38.900> on<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.769> put

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
we need to get a weight on it so we put

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.800 
we need to get a weight on it so we put
it<00:03:40.100> over<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.610> on<00:03:40.790> our<00:03:40.970> scale<00:03:42.970> all<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.330> we

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
it over here on our scale all that we

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.449 
it over here on our scale all that we
open<00:03:45.230> up<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.530> report<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:47.860> we<00:03:48.860> see<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.250> weight

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
open up the report and we see the weight

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.699 
open up the report and we see the weight
of<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.850> bracelet<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.570> twenty<00:03:51.260> seven<00:03:51.680> point

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
of the bracelet is twenty seven point

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.050 
of the bracelet is twenty seven point
seven<00:03:52.430> nine<00:03:52.850> grams<00:03:54.070> which<00:03:55.070> we<00:03:55.280> put<00:03:55.519> that<00:03:55.760> into

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
seven nine grams which we put that into

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.789 
seven nine grams which we put that into
the<00:03:56.360> report

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.880 

and<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:02.280> tells<00:04:02.670> us<00:04:03.290> based<00:04:04.290> on<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
and that tells us based on the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.979 
and that tells us based on the
percentage<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.730> gold<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.329> item<00:04:06.659> that<00:04:06.689> it

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
percentage of gold in the item that it

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.039 
percentage of gold in the item that it
contains<00:04:07.470> sixteen<00:04:08.099> point<00:04:08.489> five<00:04:08.610> six<00:04:09.209> grams<00:04:09.659> of
