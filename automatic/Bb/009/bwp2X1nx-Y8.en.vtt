and<00:02:20.370> doing<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.360> do<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.780> right<00:02:21.960> way<00:02:22.200> or

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and doing what we do the right way or

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.560 
and doing what we do the right way or

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.900 
saw the energy on defense we got some
