00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
dark wash and I feel like it kind of

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.300 
dark wash and I feel like it kind of
slows<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.840> down<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.349> then<00:03:36.739> I'll<00:03:36.859> back<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.069> a

here's what they look like up close the
heel<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.310> probably<00:03:52.669> about<00:03:52.819> 4<00:03:53.239> inches<00:03:53.480> but<00:03:54.260> it

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
heel is probably about 4 inches but it

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.050 
heel is probably about 4 inches but it
does<00:03:54.560> have<00:03:54.739> an<00:03:54.889> inch<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> half<00:03:55.310> platform<00:03:55.910> in

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
the front so it does make them pretty

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.280 
the front so it does make them pretty
comfortable<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.340> walk<00:03:58.549> in<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.510> got<00:03:59.870> these<00:03:59.989> I
