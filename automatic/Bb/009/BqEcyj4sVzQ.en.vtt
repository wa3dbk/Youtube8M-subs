00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.389
 Hello to all lovers of makeup and manicure 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.920
 and today it is connected to me they will think that 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.330
 it will be nice to show you how 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.820
 make yourself so comfortable 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.500
 the handle of cats is it korean 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.359
 invention is a foundation in the form of 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.970
 buttons that can be corrected makeup 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.130
 during the day this head came to me because 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.050
 the fact that her friend is bad 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.390
 familiar public I live I 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.820
 explained what they let them hear and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.890
 genius and why it is brilliant 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.989
 such a small bath about which I 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.809
 the mirror here you are here lies puff a 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.339
 inside the foundation is poured 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.170
 inside here is such a sponge 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.839
 accordingly, it does not spill out 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.239
 It is very convenient to transport it 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.949
 very convenient to use sponzhikom 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.409
 from latex in which do not breed 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.329
 microbes in the morning like this I attach 7 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.190
 movement is very spontaneous 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.049
 beautiful smooth coating any super 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.359
 convenient to correct makeup during the day 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.889
 but with all its genius product 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.049
 quite expensive because here itself 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.100
 packaging and this whole system is worth 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.559
 quite expensive 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.580
 cheaper than 800 rubles and generally find 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.260
 pretty hard 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.270
 the second problem is that in europe 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.500
 such a big trend for this kind 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.090
 there is no product yet 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.950
 and accordingly dark colors for 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.020
 is there any strange European skin 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 pattona at least give a yellowish 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.160
 there are no approaches in them but I decided that we 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.410
 we can do exactly that for ourselves 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.410
 hue that we want because even 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.330
 the darkest is such a couchon on mine and 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.670
 tanned skin will be extreme light 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.100
 I rummaged the Internet with this only to my own 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.110
 hands to do such a thing and basically 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 90 percent suggest just buy 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 empty packaging from eating they are status 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.030
 from 15 20 dollars and I decided that this is already 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.010
 absurd so let's figure out how 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.870
 do it yourself out of scouts 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.790
 some materials consider 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.670
 the device itself is packaging here with us 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.870
 inside the mirror is one small with help 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.350
 we need to apply 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.020
 the product it will be exactly with very small 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 The sponge should be a separator and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.790
 there must be a sponge inside 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.310
 already with large pores and the product itself 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.650
 inside it is such a concealer cheese and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.300
 moisturizing shooting range announcing from the sun 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.369
 general mix what we need 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.200
 first empty powder jar 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.599
 preferably a mirror and preferably 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.389
 deep secondly suitable in size 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.459
 a sponge in which Santon will be and in her 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.920
 there must be large pores with small 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.790
 pores need a smaller sponge which 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.150
 will apply 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 the product itself on the face type of sponge and of course 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.069
 tonal basis of your shade for 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 oily skin matting base either 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.569
 pore filling for dry skin 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.060
 sunscreen with moisturizer 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.730
 good effect you can right grass you 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 base if the coverage is not enough for 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.989
 your preference then take more 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.180
 dense rack concealer first thing to us 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.120
 will need this good bunk 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.060
 preferably such a deep package from 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.189
 powders or tones ideally if they already 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.159
 there is a split and additionally a sponge 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:02.090
 it's just a dream so do such a kick 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.909
 sometimes do papers in rouge milan you 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.829
 you will find the same mirror too if without 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.250
 mirrors such that it can be as 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.340
 products called le mani di 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.920
 absolutely perfect packaging, as it were 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.950
 then under the jackpot and the most ideal of my 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.630
 packaging Urumyan balls oriflame they me 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.300
 I like them where I pour them 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.430
 but the packaging itself simply requires and may 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.459
 yes because deep and here just 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.980
 there is a very successful sponge if you choose 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.709
 packaging in which there is no sponge then you 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.810
 You can get this very budget in 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.530
 stores where either cosmetics is sold 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.550
 either different household goods and 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.410
 household chemicals 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.209
 little advice if you are very fat 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.570
 this skin is added a little bit 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.270
 crumbly absorbent powder first 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.820
 the tone is a bit darker for my shade 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.370
 skin also i know i will add 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.660
 more highlighting the base to me very 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.090
 like the way she aligns 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.630
 but she is whitish so tone i 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.730
 immediately took a little bit darker 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.280
 completely nacre because i am now 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.030
 I love these basics and a little bit more 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.670
 lighter concealer for density and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.510
 such a mix of skin care and base which 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.979
 aligns pores and tightens them 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.650
 the last thing we need is a q-tip 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:24.510
 or spatula anything than we can it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.510
 mix well interfere interfere 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.470
 for some reason, all whose videos I watched immediately 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.330
 do this stop i recommend 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.759
 first try preferably on the face 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.009
 shade that suits you or 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.639
 something must be added I think that such 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:49.419
 fits and let's lower our sponge 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.419
 inside here 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.330
 fine i like the degree of coverage 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.060
 everything suits me otherwise 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.730
 you can raise your own this lower one 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.680
 so let's say the sponge again add different 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.200
 products mix and do the same again 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.270
 put it down and that's it like this 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.400
 we made it clear according to our needs 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.830
 according to our skin tone is perfect 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.540
 suitable for us products with a sponge for 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.460
 make-up remover 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.650
 Thanks for watching if you have 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.300
 putting on an idea how even more convenient 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.770
 do the same thing please 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.450
 Share comments will be very 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.450
 interesting and new meetings yet
