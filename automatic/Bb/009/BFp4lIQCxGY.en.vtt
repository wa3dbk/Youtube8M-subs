 l + r 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.619
 very well 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:26.249
 code list we have to put the small numeric code 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 ok bsa fart too 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.659
 here is the stable 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.659
 so let's go to the site again 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:47.739
 let's go to the site 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.019
 we take 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.939
 the of 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.419
 and then we paste 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.419
 lose 15 having our code done 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.669
 we can also quad band add a folder to tidy up the whole 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.359
 % 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.749
 let's put a title 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.069
 continue the folder with mac 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.839
 if for example 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.159
 tricks go city 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.219
 and then I could put a note on it 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.689
 on what 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.469

 laurel 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.199
 let's take the example 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.199
 censis are found 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:38.809
 sister2 20 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.099
 and we put in endless money 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:51.029
 and then there is this small option this option is dead 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:53.089
 very helpful 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.169
 r 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.299
 % 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.360
 seasonal 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.930
 just one trick at a time 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.789
 then in the folder 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:01.590
 exhibitions 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.989
 and also the mini very useful a spring object such as berry tricks above 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.409
 the rim paolo conte - in the tall grass 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.579

 yes, you don't even snack with sege 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.139
 therefore having infinite money obviously anna folder 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.709
 then open to do so we pray more 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.650
 100 having obtained I add india - sr stella 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.790
 if we are happy and our work 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.729
 we can also save vona 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.729
 to do test alba 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.329
 to reality then we close our r4 ccn 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.419
 and let's put it on then 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.419
 bellan r4imenu folders 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.150
 mhm I call our srce at darts here 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.029
 for this beautiful sdhc and r4i clone versions 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.879
 and for example to skin r4 normal therefore only for ds light ibs 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.740
 locmt2 will not put the doubt put in some 4minute 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.300
 then going up 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.860
 arenda version ours is our trick 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.449
 for when
