2006 subaru impreza and what you've got

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520 
2006 subaru impreza and what you've got
here<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.789> that<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.450> fuel<00:01:16.719> tank<00:01:16.930> actually<00:01:17.110> sits

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
here is that the fuel tank actually sits

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.429 
here is that the fuel tank actually sits
underneath<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.189> car<00:01:18.399> it's<00:01:19.180> not<00:01:19.329> it's<00:01:20.229> very

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
underneath the car it's not it's very

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.749 
underneath the car it's not it's very
similar<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.740> conventional<00:01:20.860> cars<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:21.640> not

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
similar to conventional cars it's not

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.160 
similar to conventional cars it's not
inside<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.119> boot<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.689> sits<00:01:22.869> underneath

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
inside the boot so it sits underneath

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.910 
inside the boot so it sits underneath
this<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.920> where<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.189> fuel<00:01:24.460> cell<00:01:24.670> sits<00:01:25.119> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this is where the fuel cell sits and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.080 
this is where the fuel cell sits and
imagine<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.009> floor<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.429> the<00:01:27.549> car<00:01:27.759> underneath

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
imagine the floor of the car underneath

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.210 
imagine the floor of the car underneath
and<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.960> goes<00:01:29.140> up<00:01:29.350> against<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.770> floor<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.159> in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and it goes up against the floor and in

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.800 
and it goes up against the floor and in
this<00:01:30.369> area<00:01:30.759> then<00:01:30.970> this<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.299> fuel<00:01:31.600> cell

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
this area then this is the fuel cell

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.389 
this area then this is the fuel cell
this<00:01:31.929> is<00:01:31.990> actually<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.560> transmission<00:01:33.369> tunnel

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
this is actually the transmission tunnel

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.950 
this is actually the transmission tunnel
where<00:01:33.819> the<00:01:33.909> prop<00:01:34.119> shaft<00:01:34.149> will<00:01:34.539> come<00:01:34.750> through

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
where the prop shaft will come through

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.480 
where the prop shaft will come through
when<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.229> exhaust<00:01:35.590> underneath<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:36.460> well

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
when the exhaust underneath as well

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.100 
when the exhaust underneath as well
there's<00:01:36.819> a<00:01:36.850> lot<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.030> heat<00:01:37.240> shielding<00:01:37.720> to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
there's a lot of heat shielding to

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.410 
there's a lot of heat shielding to
actually<00:01:38.439> protect<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.009> fuel<00:01:39.369> cell<00:01:39.640> from<00:01:39.850> the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
actually protect the fuel cell from the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.839 
actually protect the fuel cell from the
temperature<00:01:40.810> coming<00:01:41.170> through<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:42.069> after<00:01:42.729> that

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
temperature coming through so after that

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:45.089 
temperature coming through so after that
then<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.179> inside<00:01:43.780> you've<00:01:44.020> got<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.799> fuel

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
then you inside you've got the fuel

which<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.420> delivers<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> fuel<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> engine

which then delivers a fuel to the engine

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.860 
which then delivers a fuel to the engine
and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.940> side<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.359> this<00:02:16.480> where<00:02:16.750> the

and then on this side is this where the

and then on this side is this where the

which put the fuel into the car
surprisingly<00:02:21.970> enough<00:02:22.090> it's<00:02:22.510> possible<00:02:22.930> for
