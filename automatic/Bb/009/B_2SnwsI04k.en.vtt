won 2500 - and 2500 3 which actually

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920 
won 2500 - and 2500 3 which actually
isn't<00:00:43.829> prototypical<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.700> all<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
isn't prototypical at all but one of the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.639 
isn't prototypical at all but one of the
cons<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.500> buying<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:48.469> they<00:00:49.469> only

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cons with buying these was they only

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
cons with buying these was they only
gave<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.250> eight<00:00:50.520> numbers<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.480> choose<00:00:51.719> from

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
gave you eight numbers to choose from

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
gave you eight numbers to choose from
and<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.680> were<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.070> consecutive<00:00:53.489> order

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
and they were all in consecutive order

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.090 
and they were all in consecutive order
so<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.320> only<00:00:55.590> choose<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:56.129> 25,000<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
so you can only choose from 25,000 to

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
so you can only choose from 25,000 to
25,000<00:00:59.100> seven<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> wanted<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.170> over

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
25,000 seven so if you wanted to do over

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
25,000 seven so if you wanted to do over
eight<00:01:01.739> cars<00:01:02.210> you're<00:01:03.210> kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> luck

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
eight cars you're kind of out of luck

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.039 
eight cars you're kind of out of luck
unless<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.470> want<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> custom-make<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.049> cut

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
unless you want to custom-make and cut

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.730 
unless you want to custom-make and cut
your<00:01:07.260> own<00:01:07.880> individual<00:01:08.880> numbers<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.720> trust<00:01:10.590> me

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
your own individual numbers and trust me

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
your own individual numbers and trust me
when<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> put<00:01:11.430> six<00:01:11.729> numbers<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.210> each

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
when you have to put six numbers on each

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.590 
when you have to put six numbers on each
car<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> best<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
car that's not the best way to go but I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
car that's not the best way to go but I
guess<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.350> switch<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
guess I can just switch them around in

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.770 
guess I can just switch them around in
the<00:01:17.820> concert<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:18.659> look

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the concert so they don't look

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
the concert so they don't look
consecutive<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> cons

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
consecutive but that was one of the cons

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.810 
consecutive but that was one of the cons
the<00:01:21.509> only<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.900> con<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:23.460> doesn't

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the only other con I have this doesn't

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.700 
the only other con I have this doesn't
bother<00:01:23.970> me<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> bothers<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.560> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
bother me but I know it bothers a lot of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.289 
bother me but I know it bothers a lot of
people<00:01:26.040> who<00:01:26.580> model<00:01:27.390> Amtrak<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.320> AM<00:01:28.439> fleets

people who model Amtrak with AM fleets

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
people who model Amtrak with AM fleets
they<00:01:30.299> didn't<00:01:30.540> change<00:01:30.720> any<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.350> tooling

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
they didn't change any of the tooling

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.780 
they didn't change any of the tooling
under<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.250> cars<00:01:32.659> or<00:01:33.659> any<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.790> mechanical

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
under the cars or any of the mechanical

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.840 
under the cars or any of the mechanical
aspects<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> cars<00:01:36.960> themselves<00:01:37.729> they<00:01:38.729> only

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
aspects of the cars themselves they only

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.480 
aspects of the cars themselves they only
changed<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.299> paint<00:01:39.540> scheme<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.100> many<00:01:41.100> people

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
changed the paint scheme and many people

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.219 
changed the paint scheme and many people
have<00:01:41.820> been<00:01:41.850> deterred<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.450> buying<00:01:42.990> these

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
have been deterred from buying these

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.560 
have been deterred from buying these
cars<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.360> know

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
cars because of that I don't really know

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.130 
cars because of that I don't really know
why<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.110> never<00:01:46.290> bothered<00:01:46.740> me<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.390> guess

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
why it's never bothered me it I guess

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.960 
why it's never bothered me it I guess
isn't<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.770> best<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:51.619> don't<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.850> it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
isn't the best I don't know I think it's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.859 
isn't the best I don't know I think it's
fine<00:01:54.979> but<00:01:55.979> um<00:01:56.219> those<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> only<00:01:57.329> cons<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
fine but um those are the only cons I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.920 
fine but um those are the only cons I
have<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.399> pros<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.119> pretty<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
that's nice so that's pretty much it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.570

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
for a while though and yeah that's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.460 
for a while though and yeah that's
pretty<00:03:00.150> much<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:02.990> comes<00:03:03.990> with<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> same

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470

I<00:03:24.400> would<00:03:25.400> highly<00:03:25.730> recommend<00:03:26.180> getting<00:03:26.239> these

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
I would highly recommend getting these

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.170 
I would highly recommend getting these
cars<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.680> last<00:03:27.709> batch<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.310> am<00:03:28.730> fleet<00:03:28.970> to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
cars the last batch of am fleet to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.809 
cars the last batch of am fleet to
coaches<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.620> their<00:03:31.129> way<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.580> Staples

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
coaches is on their way to the Staples

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.550 
coaches is on their way to the Staples
store<00:03:32.300> if<00:03:32.450> I'm<00:03:32.629> correct<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.230> after<00:03:33.440> that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
store if I'm correct and after that

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.130 
store if I'm correct and after that
that'll<00:03:33.890> be<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:35.150> there's<00:03:35.540> probably<00:03:35.720> only

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
that'll be it so there's probably only

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.910 
that'll be it so there's probably only
around<00:03:36.349> 100<00:03:36.560> left<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:38.870> thing<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.319> did

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
around 100 left one thing I did

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.520 
around 100 left one thing I did
that<00:03:40.400> wasn't<00:03:40.700> factory<00:03:41.390> installed<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:42.290> think

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
that wasn't factory installed I think

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.309 
that wasn't factory installed I think
you<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.799> see<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.129> in<00:03:43.280> this<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:44.110> took<00:03:45.110> a

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
you can see it in this I took a

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.619 
you can see it in this I took a
decorating<00:03:46.160> sharpie<00:03:46.610> it<00:03:46.790> was<00:03:46.940> like<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> silver

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
decorating sharpie it was like a silver

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.650 
decorating sharpie it was like a silver
gloss<00:03:47.959> kind<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.430> went<00:03:49.849> around<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.299> trim<00:03:50.629> of

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
gloss kind and I went around the trim of

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.420 
gloss kind and I went around the trim of
the<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:52.730> diaphragms<00:03:53.569> on<00:03:54.290> each<00:03:54.920> end<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.310> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
the the diaphragms on each end of the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.050 
the the diaphragms on each end of the
car<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.480> sharpie<00:03:57.410> them<00:03:57.590> silver<00:03:58.060> which

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
car and I sharpie them silver which

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.000 
car and I sharpie them silver which
makes<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.750> little<00:03:59.900> bit<00:04:00.049> more<00:04:00.200> realistic<00:04:00.560> if

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
makes it a little bit more realistic if

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.009 
makes it a little bit more realistic if
you<00:04:01.130> look<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.670> natural<00:04:02.209> prototypes<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
you look on the natural prototypes the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.850 
you look on the natural prototypes the
ends<00:04:03.140> of<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:04.569> diaphragms<00:04:05.569> are<00:04:05.870> kind<00:04:06.709> of

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
ends of the diaphragms are kind of

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.650 
ends of the diaphragms are kind of
silverish<00:04:07.340> but<00:04:07.610> I<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.510> makes

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
silverish but I like it I think it makes

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.300 
silverish but I like it I think it makes
the<00:04:08.810> ends<00:04:08.989> of<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.290> car<00:04:09.470> pop<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.010> just<00:04:10.190> think

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the ends of the car pop and I just think

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.890 
the ends of the car pop and I just think
it<00:04:10.670> makes<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.200> car<00:04:12.200> look<00:04:12.319> better<00:04:12.530> overall<00:04:13.900> so

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
it makes the car look better overall so

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.569 
it makes the car look better overall so
I<00:04:14.930> did<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.620> all<00:04:15.829> of<00:04:15.860> them<00:04:16.190> I've<00:04:16.340> done<00:04:16.459> it

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
I did that on all of them I've done it

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.360 
I did that on all of them I've done it
with<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.789> view<00:04:16.970> liners<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.660> coaches<00:04:18.370> baggage
