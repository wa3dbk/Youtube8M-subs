00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
long grinding games and i'm sure that in

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.270 
long grinding games and i'm sure that in
a<00:02:52.050> lot<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.200> those<00:02:52.350> games<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:52.800> those<00:02:53.010> would<00:02:53.220> have

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
a lot of those games so those would have

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.620 
a lot of those games so those would have
eventually<00:02:53.520> found<00:02:53.880> its<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.239> top<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
eventually found its way to the top and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.229 
eventually found its way to the top and
then<00:02:55.080> onto<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> field<00:02:55.620> yeah<00:02:56.220> exactly<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
then onto the field yeah exactly in it

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.760 
then onto the field yeah exactly in it
it's<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.720> powerful<00:02:57.930> card<00:02:58.410> there's

in modern yet but a lot of us ran it

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.680 
in modern yet but a lot of us ran it
this<00:03:49.890> ptq<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.610> mainly<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.329> it's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
this ptq just mainly because of the it's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.229 
this ptq just mainly because of the it's
got<00:03:51.870> three<00:03:52.079> effects<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:53.519> biggest<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
got three effects the biggest one is it

hits<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.510> board<00:03:54.690> from<00:03:54.810> minus<00:03:55.079> one<00:03:55.260> minus<00:03:55.440> one

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
hits the board from minus one minus one

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.949 
hits the board from minus one minus one
um<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:57.030> really<00:03:57.390> really<00:03:57.600> good<00:03:57.630> against

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959
