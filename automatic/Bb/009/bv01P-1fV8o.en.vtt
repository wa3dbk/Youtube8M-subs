00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello people you see him again in the gtv 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 and today there is a little new one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 review about this pc here like her one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 or others may already have realized 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 the whole thing is not that big 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 the housing is a mini itx 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.300
 housing of bitfenix and that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.220
 predicate for mini itx ratios that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.399
 is a mini pc for these relationships 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.559
 is great but changed for others like 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.890
 normal midi tower or big boss joy 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.719
 his housing just damn small 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 and the soap made us think about tree 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.149
 or even a small mini pc 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 not together but should not 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.199
 I have a lot of mega high end performance 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.429
 but just to take away 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.429
 so even working a bit so so 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.719
 can and still so enough power 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.589
 has to play by one or the other 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 can play on it 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.690
 so we went for this one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.489
 housing once decided components 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.620
 I'll tell you right down here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 already hid the internet stick and 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.590
 Although he tells us that it is an intel 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 pentium is which was installed and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.380
 Although the model g 860 with 3 ghz clock is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.619
 a dual core processor on the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
 sandy bridge architecture is based is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.740
 even the burner of lg the whole 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.200
 housing is why then but will 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 connection from the mainboard and the rest so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.689
 then of course we have the one here 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 air outlet or 120 millimeter fan 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.899
 which can also be a 140 mm fan 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.329
 you can see it installed up here 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.110
 that would be the right hole there 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.680
 left hole as under 20 models easy 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 at times 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.649
 It was at the bottom of BE quiet 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.420
 we have the lime plug here 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.170
 or the designated 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.259
 socket 2 x usb 2.0 a ps 2 keyboard 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.780
 connecting vga output dvi output and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.960
 HDMI output this from the internal graphics 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.420
 chip in that case would be the intel hd 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 2000 we have here again 2 x usb 2.0 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.370
 esata network interface of two usb 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.410
 3.0 and 7.1 sound card with optical 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.210
 exit 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 and here we also have a usb 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.710
 3.0 card with four boxes installed 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.360
 that must be left of Luke but that 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.770
 I'll see you soon 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.990
 yes okay for the connections to the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.640
 back of the housing or the computer 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.620
 and now we're looking at it all the time 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.850
 inside 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.010
 okay the pc is open i hope you 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 You can see that from here 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.430
 the lighting was the whole thing 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.510
 just not that big because of the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.070
 small size you can already here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.870
 due to the mainboard recognizing that is 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.790
 as I said mini itx mainboard we have 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.680
 we only have a pci express 16vor 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.110
 Of course, we first thank plug 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.850
 to install a graphics card 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.330
 but now we have the usb 3.0 here 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.470
 built-in card 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.320
 we come to the processor as I said 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:07.080
 the intel pentium d 860 mhz clocks the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.590
 mainboard is a model of s rock and 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.670
 Although it is that h61 mtx table comes with 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.959
 unfortunately not quite the camera 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.890
 but here you see it 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.510
 To some extent, I believe costs around 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.680
 the 60 euro is really not 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.360
 expensive and for the functions that that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.820
 of course you can not do that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.620
 Processor to maximum level overclock 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.769
 that offers both processes and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.150
 not a chipset but for what a 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.470
 because it is offered the price is really 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.080
 completely fair for those especially with the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.980
 e sata connect the usb 2.0 and the 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.420
 pci express 16x it really is one 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.739
 I do not even have a good offer 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.989
 just recommend the board of one 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.140
 Small pc wants to assemble power adapter 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.670
 is from be quiet pure power l7 with 53 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.950
 watt attains depth completely, above all 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.549
 with me no dedicated graphics card 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.220
 installed 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.640
 we have a 4 gb ddr3 here 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.600
 Memory bars of courses and 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.340
 nothing else here on the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600
 boards silver I'll show you soon 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.340
 a few connection from the board of 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.739
 the top of the pc because you can namely 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.680
 was looking through here from the angle 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.940
 it looks a bit confusing 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.470
 from burner of lg and down here always 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.030
 another one terabyte hard disk from 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.290
 Seagate and front've also got a 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.810
 fan for ventilation that means the whole 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.330
 concept goes and rhine through her and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.460
 in the back so out the standard 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.560
 Ventilation as you can see it is 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.900
 really great we are now again 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.760
 to the mainboard and then we'll see 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.430
 the whole now so again from above 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.460
 here a little peephole 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.750
 and that's how it looks from above 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.270
 out there everything is already something 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.570
 clearer so the mainboard there 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.730
 talk three times there but that's enough for 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.620
 this system is completely out of here 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.410
 a fourth s ata has been provided by 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.240
 svp sees it technically 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.500
 but it is not connected 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.050
 with buxe that means we can 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.270
 Expected to them without tinkering 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.940
 not use 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.620
 The same applies here for various 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.810
 USB interfaces but we have here 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.460
 twice usb 2.0 in the middle of the white 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.800
 that is still a speaker connection the 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.760
 camera wobbles is unfortunately a bit 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.830
 that in the middle is just a speaker 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.060
 connection that means there are also still 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.430
 connect one and there for 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.530
 RAM also have free 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.370
 ddr3 1600 is maximum of this word 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.120
 supports sunday is yes ex 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.380
 then it is still certified 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.310
 frontpanel in or 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.970
 microphone and audio inputs and the 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.890
 It was actually so far to this pc 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.120
 if you have any questions write it in 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.850
 the comments or a private one 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.230
 message as before also for info what 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.280
 certainly the most interesting thing about this 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.410
 pcs that is the computer on the windows 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.680
 Having 8 installed means as much as 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:59.390
 all windows 8 reviews test or 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.880
 Software tricks and tools or tips 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.830
 if we have this pc running here 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.940
 that means the pc is not 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.290
 just out of boredom 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.150
 but also for so reasonable a small 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.400
 we just had the idea 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.590
 as small as possible pc to take away and 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.520
 combined and then windows 8 test pc 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.530
 that came out i hope my satisfied 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.640
 Anyway, I think that we are still in 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.900
 future a lot with this computer 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.940
 work is currently standing there 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.170
 actually only here around because we still 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.310
 ours of all pcs with which we 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.830
 mainly currently working and 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.000
 But videos are about windows 8 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.170
 Let's enter the system here 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.080
 prefer or 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.720
 we have no other choice and yes 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.410
 so thanks for watching and see you 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.410
 to the next video
