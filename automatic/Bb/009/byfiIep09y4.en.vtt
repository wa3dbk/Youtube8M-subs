update on this Marengo right here after
about<00:00:13.870> I<00:00:14.080> think<00:00:14.230> nine<00:00:14.680> days<00:00:15.099> or<00:00:15.430> something

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
about I think nine days or something

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.300 
about I think nine days or something
like<00:00:15.820> that<00:00:16.199> nine<00:00:17.199> or<00:00:17.380> ten<00:00:17.590> days<00:00:17.740> I<00:00:18.010> got<00:00:18.189> the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
like that nine or ten days I got the

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.580 
like that nine or ten days I got the
first<00:00:18.550> one<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.849> come<00:00:19.000> up<00:00:19.060> which<00:00:19.960> i<00:00:20.170> think<00:00:20.380> was

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
first one to come up which i think was

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.070 
first one to come up which i think was
this<00:00:20.770> one<00:00:20.980> right<00:00:21.160> here<00:00:21.520> and<00:00:21.699> it's<00:00:22.690> basically

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
this one right here and it's basically

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.560 
this one right here and it's basically
done<00:00:23.350> nothing<00:00:23.800> since<00:00:24.070> then<00:00:24.340> they<00:00:24.610> got<00:00:24.850> two

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
done nothing since then they got two

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.070 
done nothing since then they got two
more<00:00:25.810> to<00:00:25.960> come<00:00:26.170> up<00:00:26.380> out<00:00:26.590> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:28.480> six

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
more to come up out of the six

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.380 
more to come up out of the six
olia<00:00:29.380> Faro<00:00:29.710> that<00:00:29.949> I<00:00:29.980> planted<00:00:30.520> so<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.270> was

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
olia Faro that I planted so that was

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.290 
olia Faro that I planted so that was
three<00:00:31.630> out<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:31.840> six<00:00:32.140> 50%<00:00:33.070> not<00:00:33.609> too<00:00:33.820> bad<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:34.269> think

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
three out of six 50% not too bad I think

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.970 
three out of six 50% not too bad I think
that's<00:00:34.629> why<00:00:34.780> they<00:00:34.960> always<00:00:35.199> get<00:00:35.440> extra<00:00:35.710> seeds

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
that's why they always get extra seeds

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.229 
that's why they always get extra seeds
when<00:00:36.220> these<00:00:36.309> things<00:00:36.610> when<00:00:36.790> you<00:00:36.820> order<00:00:37.120> them

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
when these things when you order them

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.130 
when these things when you order them
and<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:38.320> got<00:00:38.500> one<00:00:38.800> the<00:00:39.340> steno<00:00:39.640> patellar<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:40.840> up

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
and I got one the steno patellar it's up

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.870 
and I got one the steno patellar it's up
I<00:00:41.410> don't<00:00:41.890> know<00:00:42.010> what<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.250> heck<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.520> going<00:00:42.760> on

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
the fact that there is no growth

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.340 
the fact that there is no growth
whatsoever<00:00:48.540> once<00:00:49.540> these<00:00:49.750> things<00:00:50.020> came<00:00:50.290> up

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the oleifera I'm going to plant six more

the oleifera I'm going to plant six more
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> ouvea<00:01:41.250> Farrow<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:41.930> try<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.170> out

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
of the ouvea Farrow and try them out

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.820 
of the ouvea Farrow and try them out
since<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.149> come<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.110> quickest<00:01:46.619> they're

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
since they come up the quickest they're

the<00:01:46.920> easiest<00:01:47.280> ones<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.759> grow<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.179> my

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the easiest ones to grow is my

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.150 
the easiest ones to grow is my
understanding<00:01:49.050> but<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> should<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:49.979> done

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
little bit of rabbit manure and see if I

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.770 
little bit of rabbit manure and see if I
can't<00:02:17.459> give<00:02:17.640> these<00:02:17.790> things<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.300> quick<00:02:18.510> boost

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
can't give these things a quick boost

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.319 
can't give these things a quick boost
and<00:02:19.190> make<00:02:20.190> them<00:02:20.370> grow<00:02:20.519> like<00:02:20.790> they're<00:02:20.970> supposed

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
and make them grow like they're supposed

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.840 
and make them grow like they're supposed
to<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.840> understand<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.650> they<00:02:22.799> they<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.640> live

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
to I understand that they they can live

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.289 
to I understand that they they can live
and<00:02:24.120> survive<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.780> drought<00:02:25.049> conditions<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:27.150> me

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
and survive in drought conditions to me

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.050 
and survive in drought conditions to me
I<00:02:27.329> think<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:28.019> all<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.709> good<00:02:28.799> but<00:02:29.250> I'm

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
I think that's all well and good but I'm

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.509 
I think that's all well and good but I'm
used<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.600> growing<00:02:30.959> plants<00:02:31.260> feeding<00:02:32.190> them<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
used to growing plants feeding them and

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.420 
used to growing plants feeding them and
having<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> plants<00:02:33.329> respond<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.470> let's<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
having the plants respond so let's just

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.770 
having the plants respond so let's just
see<00:02:35.579> what<00:02:35.730> these<00:02:35.850> things<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.329> do<00:02:36.450> with<00:02:36.630> some

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
see what these things would do with some

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.280 
see what these things would do with some
good<00:02:36.959> soil<00:02:40.250> alright<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.489> what<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.670> did<00:02:42.290> I'm

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
good soil alright so what I did I'm

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.440 
good soil alright so what I did I'm
pretty<00:02:43.590> optimistic<00:02:43.829> about<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.940> trust

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
pretty optimistic about this I trust

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
pretty optimistic about this I trust
putting<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.320> plant<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.980> good<00:02:47.570> good<00:02:48.570> soil<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.170> I

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and put it in crappy soil and it's going

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.300 
and put it in crappy soil and it's going
to<00:02:57.420> sit<00:02:57.600> there<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.859> sitting<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.220> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
to sit there so just sitting in that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.920 
to sit there so just sitting in that
peat<00:02:59.609> there's<00:02:59.910> no<00:03:00.120> nutrition<00:03:00.329> in<00:03:00.810> it

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
peat there's no nutrition in it

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.720 
peat there's no nutrition in it
whatsoever<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.769> there<00:03:01.980> was<00:03:02.070> no<00:03:02.250> growth<00:03:02.489> going

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
whatsoever so there was no growth going

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.840 
whatsoever so there was no growth going
on<00:03:03.000> what<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:03.959> got<00:03:04.230> right<00:03:04.440> here<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.709> three<00:03:05.070> pretty

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
on what I got right here is three pretty

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.060 
on what I got right here is three pretty
good-sized<00:03:06.299> pot<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.079> don't<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.829> size

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
good-sized pot I don't know what size

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.259 
good-sized pot I don't know what size
you'd<00:03:08.370> call<00:03:08.640> them<00:03:10.489> with<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> number<00:03:11.820> one<00:03:12.000> pot

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
you'd call them with a number one pot

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.360 
you'd call them with a number one pot
whatever<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> heck<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.049> is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
whatever the heck that is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.979 
whatever the heck that is
but<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.609> mixed<00:03:15.359> up<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.600> little<00:03:15.750> soil<00:03:16.019> mix<00:03:16.380> some

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
but I mixed up a little soil mix some

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.020 
but I mixed up a little soil mix some
mixed<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.109> some<00:03:19.410> rabbit<00:03:20.190> manure<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
mixed in some rabbit manure in it and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.449 
mixed in some rabbit manure in it and
did<00:03:21.959> put<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.380> little<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.769> perlite<00:03:23.160> I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
did put it a little bit of perlite I

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.550 
did put it a little bit of perlite I
think<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.540> good<00:03:24.690> soil<00:03:25.019> mixture<00:03:25.410> right

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
think this is a good soil mixture right

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.660 
think this is a good soil mixture right
here<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.810> stuff<00:03:28.079> ought<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.650> something

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
here so the stuff ought to do something

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.090 
here so the stuff ought to do something
so<00:03:29.819> what<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.120> looks<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.650> when<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.800> come<00:03:31.980> up

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
so what it looks like when it's come up

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.080 
so what it looks like when it's come up
out<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.460> seed

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
out of the seed

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.930 
out of the seed
you<00:03:33.630> got<00:03:33.840> your<00:03:34.110> remember<00:03:34.709> how<00:03:34.830> funny<00:03:35.130> when

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
you got your remember how funny when

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.670 
you got your remember how funny when
you're<00:03:36.030> looking<00:03:36.240> those<00:03:36.390> seeds<00:03:36.690> were<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.200> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
you're looking those seeds were and you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.080 
you're looking those seeds were and you
got<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> little<00:03:38.220> sprout<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.550> comes<00:03:38.910> with

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
got this little sprout that comes with

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.600 
got this little sprout that comes with
either<00:03:39.180> side<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.350> I'm<00:03:41.190> going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.459> is

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
either side of it so I'm going to do is

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.449 
either side of it so I'm going to do is
just<00:03:41.819> stick<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.120> down<00:03:42.240> in<00:03:42.300> there<00:03:43.340> cover<00:03:44.340> a

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
just stick it down in there cover a

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.030 
just stick it down in there cover a
little<00:03:44.670> bit<00:03:44.850> give<00:03:45.420> us<00:03:45.569> some<00:03:45.720> water<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.260> see<00:03:46.920> if

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
little bit give us some water and see if

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.000 
little bit give us some water and see if
these<00:03:47.160> additional<00:03:47.760> nutrients<00:03:48.620> can<00:03:49.620> kick<00:03:49.830> this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
these additional nutrients can kick this

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.430 
these additional nutrients can kick this
kick<00:03:50.310> start<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.700> thing<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.240> make<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> go

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
kick start this thing and make a go

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.050 
kick start this thing and make a go
ahead<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.770> grow
