00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 hi to all and 6 pm when we end up 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.530
 paul mangwana mk 46 and a law that comes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 of my live stream because I only play 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 you have three in livestream I believe 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.130
 I did not play too much without stream is a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 little this morning but otherwise I have very 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 long time I have not played in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.090
 livestream years ago because here I try 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.320
 to have all the machine guns 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.960
 finally all the weapons that remain in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.369
 gold in livestream and also for 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 livestream not especially lightning 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.619
 but in any case I try to have all 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.809
 weapons in hours before black ops 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 them and I live stream a lot of these 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.300
 gone then I got two guns in 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 back I had the n118 to 1 and the ice 50 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 as soft I was not very far but I 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 gold eyes so much better 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.399
 then I'll tell you good but I 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 do not know if you saw it or not but 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.840
 obama is elected president of the united states 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.820
 so I believe for the second time this 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
 month I have no opinion on it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 do not know their stuff at all, but that's it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.039
 ok ok just to say yourself that you 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.449
 did not know what I doubt 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 rather because I think that all the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.979
 world and Jonathan then we had to talk 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 but in any case I'm talking about that a little 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.540
 little because to laugh a little bit 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 this morning I was I put on my 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.729
 facebook yes it's that obama george 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 kind of serious question is always 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.570
 the one plastiki really and the pl that have 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.189
 do not but you're serious and everything but 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 or stuff like that there are some 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.119
 had a little suspicion that I 'm is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.409
 excerpt and his first take on the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.159
 nobody who answered me but they have 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.600
 all made to serious mettet where they have a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.470
 little did he suspect that there was 1 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.659
 a little humor it was just a little 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.310
 this is what makes them laugh to see 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.140
 that but finally we do not care 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.329
 completely 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.320
 I wanted to talk to you a bit about 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.939
 some things that happen to me rather 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.049
 not bad it's finally rather not bad in this 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.799
 moment I have quite a few 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.340
 comments saying yes well on ps3 the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.640
 xbox pc that sucks is everything and I have not 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.049
 want to start a xbox pc war or 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.909
 or ps3 pc or do like that but what 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.959
 I mean already 2 1 the pc they are 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.989
 that that level graphics consoles 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.849
 level processor level all that all 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.780
 just because pc that's it 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.489
 every six months as the pieces 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 exchanged that can always be increased 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.650
 the power and sorting of a pc while 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.569
 the console the xbox the ps3 and came out 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.019
 I 'm not ya 5 6 years old something like that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.209
 I even know more and his consoles do not 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.650
 are not changed at all kind there was 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.299
 had no change besides the size and 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.440
 the design I believe but otherwise level 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.870
 processor maybe a little bit but 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.150
 there was no change so the pc 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.290
 are better than consoles in this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.670
 moment but for example when the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.870
 next consoles will come out 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.030
 by will precisely there will be the consoles 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.739
 who may be a little better 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.720
 than the glutes but it will not last 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.569
 a long time since pc is always 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.910
 it always grows up and where do the pc 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.049
 are good but here is more it is not 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.000
 too much the question that people say 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.410
 is that people do not ask what I 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 have just asked me this question but we 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.480
 asked the question is it 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.239
 it's easier on pc than on 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.470
 ps3 or xbox and I want to go there 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.970
 replay we can never know 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.260
 will everyone can give 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.049
 so many arguments that will be able 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.970
 never know since finally it's also 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.200
 someone is playing exactly the same time 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.389
 and with the same the same spirit wake up 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.739
 and all kinds in great shape and not in 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.560
 always being at the same concentration 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.359
 percentage of concentration on 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.299
 two accounts on pc and on a console 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.980
 to find out who is where it is 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.200
 easier because I play that on pc 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.209
 so if you 're on ps3 I'll do a 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.950
 old score while a guy who plays that 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.530
 ps3 if i put on pc it will not do a 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.970
 a score of phew 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.980
 if he's ever sure I'm sorry 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.870
 we can not say who is simpler who 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.099
 is not simpler because I want 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.440
 to say that's all that happened to me 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.269
 it's that with the help to aiming on the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.609
 console it's a lot simpler to 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.579
 aim only on pc since on pc there is no 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.109
 aiming aid 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:10.419
 which makes it a little simpler 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.680
 why it's a bit more because 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.209
 bach we do not really need to aim 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.440
 not for me when I played I played 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.030
 a little ps3 this weekend I'm going to 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.570
 a friend I did a strict 14 years 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.760
 and no 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.470
 sometimes I was not even aiming at me video he 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.730
 moved alone on the player who 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.610
 short is so in the end it was like 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.410
 if as if I did not even and where 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.300
 its limits a sowing and boots one goes 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.400
 say and that's why I find that 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.600
 it's a little easier for me but 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.250
 my bones a little easier for me 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.080
 just because here I do not know his 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.150
 hands 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.170
 it shocked me a bit but it does not want 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.910
 to say it's easier it's just 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.160
 that me with the mbodj were not 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.590
 accustomed to that help in the tradewind I was 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.630
 not used so it helps me a lot 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.630
 but after everyone his opinions I think 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.930
 that people I think people who 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.070
 who plays on ps3 and those who judge on 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.980
 extraction say to finances is more 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.750
 lasts the xbox is over in the ps3 but 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.030
 people who play on pc mean enough 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.950
 rainy the pc the game is played it's 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.660
 many the pc to have the patience of 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.130
 play it's right with all the actors 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.370
 and all the stuff like that where it's 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.840
 really hard to stay to stay playing 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.280
 without really getting upset my mission 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.900
 nerves anyway anyway it's a little 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.900
 all I wanted to say about that 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.310
 if you give your opinion without you 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.810
 beat in the comments if you 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.320
 please do not forget to leave a love 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.270
 but also beat you fight 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.920
 not a comment that is but we are 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.390
 do not care anyway people who break 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.860
 ps falling say the ps3 it's better the 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.790
 people who survive at the xbox and better 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.250
 the people who did what they go 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.990
 say call them the pcc better and we're going 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.460
 never to agree is one of 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.460
 beat you for nothing at all 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.640
 case I hope the video you liked there 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.310
 the moab explodes we arrived at the end of 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.570
 the end part explodes she has already exposed 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.440
 and there were two videos on the screen 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.570
 do not hesitate to watch them 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.500
 I am more and which ones but look 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.610
 a video he does not forget the breasts 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.650
 I like that even a lot you leave 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.880
 and a lot right now and that makes me 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.880
 roughly pinus
