00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.099
 emp grenades are full of shit and the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.239
 are only good for the electro for transit 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.180

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.920
 world record break of 68 laps currently 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
 It can definitely be in there now 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.850

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.770

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.950
 the pirates if we somehow 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.970
 should make a record of over 68 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.260
 I will definitely video 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.710
 you can make pure definitely 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.650
 pull 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.479
 yes I have to run with you once 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.810
 over now if I pass you by 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.190
 so do not wait wait so I am 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.580
 We will not stay tuned either 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.580
 all with you 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.150
 very nice I was running over it 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.730
 We can do it better in the back 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.800
 demonstrate 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:46.990
 that's the way it is 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.990
 then had 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.700
 so beautiful we may not now 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.700
 do not sprint more do not jump 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.850
 shoot no missiles then throw 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.200
 stay that way all the time 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 they are not allowed to touch either 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 I exactly we can not one 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.780
 Do not touch it here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 hit right 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.380
 therefore move once again 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.910
 they all run haphazardly through the area 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.230
 the eyes are not too bright 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.180
 more is enough here are the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.760
 Sunday drivers the slow zombies the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.220
 you got under the round and you became 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 not hit but otherwise run 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.120
 the haphazard way through the area you can 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.710
 also see through planless really 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.170
 the against some are just around 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.970
 So in time you have it now 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.270
 the time heals to go to the coast 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.709
 or whatever equip exactly or 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.290
 to go to the toilet 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:56.170
 a smoke whatever and exactly 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 as the saying goes, and as soon as we go 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.070
 Sprint again it starts again 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.400
 So like the gema on the place that me 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.400
 can jump 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.220
 yes, I think if you jump , wait 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.110
 I'll jump but you go on your 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.200
 space 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.880
 I'll jump I promise you so 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.370
 I think they'll jump then 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.750
 look again 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.890
 no, okay, I can jump 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.430
 just fucking as if I'm so sorry 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.350
 soon i sprint sure if 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.830
 you shoot that then they will 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.830
 move again 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.110
 oh yes, if you touch them then 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.860
 move again so relax 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.180
 and then it goes on 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.310
 eyes again so it is 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.420
 to go pirate is the best 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 really create it with basin so it is 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.100
 much better 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.570
 well I wanted people you just 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.210
 let's show that the grenades do it all 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.010
 can or still knows with certainty 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.600
 not everyone 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.850
 until then have fun much success in the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.200
 zombies chin and hectic is my song 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.200
 killing lot
