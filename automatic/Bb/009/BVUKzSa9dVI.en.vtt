00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.720

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.800
 I was saying 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.580
 in vain some hearts because all I did I put a shot 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.660

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 we're just going to do a little bit of 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 development 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940

 if we can say 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.979

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.809
 so here is 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:39.759
 Small break 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.459

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.729
 and since a video on the Jurassic 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:09.749
 an antique 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.589
 the time the leader 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.919
 coordinates e very well to have the same type 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.599
 and finally it is quite practically are available on 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.430
 request 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.590
 that is to say, a report to the jdd that I set foot 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.439
 and we 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.210
 but also donations 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.069
 been beaten at home 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.599
 questions 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.599
 so here we can see clearly what he is chris paul 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.650
 a resource christine broom that I left so a little change 

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:39.080
 Installation 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.009
 his name in the old to seduce 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.430
 in his room 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 like those work I'm doing new questions 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.809
 so things otherwise 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:52.809
 for more 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.379
 so it will take three more ballots 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.039
 so we will store all 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.889
 and then we go 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.689
 to climb in it 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.659
 the two pilot projects 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.559
 the mission 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.889
 traced back 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.889
 Montpellier has helped me 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.809
 the ofcom this hiring of weight 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.809
 and good retirement 6 he nevertheless allows 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.839
 so only for the form 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.839
 I'll see what it is 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.759
 so he is still 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.680
 a maid 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 little club do it 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.029
 ap 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.930
 a rape murder 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.930
 the little video the heart to finish 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.629
 the united states others leave a little too long 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.490
 he did, however, 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.770
 so if you go home you will want 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.770
 she wants to conclude this video 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.759
 here 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.529
 so as to the fate 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.870
 history and that's a little 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.310
 at the approach of your flaws commented on china this time these questions and 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:26.059
 and the next video only the years 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.330
 the other 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.060
 for
