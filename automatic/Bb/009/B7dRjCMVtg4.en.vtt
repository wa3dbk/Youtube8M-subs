this<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.330> board<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.840> was

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
this this is the board that I was

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.320 
this this is the board that I was
previously<00:00:53.470> talking<00:00:54.160> about<00:00:54.400> on<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.640> front

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
previously talking about on the front

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.270 
previously talking about on the front
words<00:00:55.540> view<00:00:55.900> let's<00:00:56.590> take<00:00:56.770> a<00:00:56.830> look<00:00:59.010> now<00:01:00.010> as<00:01:00.160> you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
words view let's take a look now as you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.730 
words view let's take a look now as you
can<00:01:00.370> see<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.760> when<00:01:00.970> it's<00:01:01.050> extended<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.500> board

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
can see you when it's extended the board

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.069 
can see you when it's extended the board
is<00:01:02.890> pushed<00:01:03.160> upward<00:01:03.579> and<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:04.299> bounces<00:01:04.869> back

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
is pushed upward and then bounces back

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.940 
is pushed upward and then bounces back
onto<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.890> piston<00:01:06.369> but<00:01:07.360> when<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.439> piston<00:01:08.829> is

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
onto the piston but when the piston is

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.980 
onto the piston but when the piston is
up<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.460> board<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.850> leaning<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.359> it<00:01:10.390> the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
up and the board is leaning on it the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.690 
up and the board is leaning on it the
piston<00:01:11.350> cannot<00:01:11.619> move<00:01:11.770> down<00:01:12.069> so<00:01:12.399> we<00:01:12.490> have<00:01:12.609> to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
piston cannot move down so we have to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.800 
piston cannot move down so we have to
press<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.030> other<00:01:13.179> button<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:14.049> recline<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:15.810> now

this<00:03:22.160> is<00:03:22.310> pretty<00:03:22.519> much<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.760> same<00:03:23.150> with<00:03:23.390> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
this is pretty much the same with the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.720 
this is pretty much the same with the
top<00:03:23.750> valve<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.470> bottom<00:03:24.860> valve<00:03:25.040> except

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
top valve and the bottom valve except

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.670 
top valve and the bottom valve except
they<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:25.880> opposite<00:03:26.480> action

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
they do opposite action

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.710 
they do opposite action
this<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.830> our<00:03:28.980> valve<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.490> off<00:03:29.640> position

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
this is our valve in the off position

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.210 
this is our valve in the off position
now<00:03:30.720> when<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> velvet<00:03:31.770> does<00:03:31.920> not<00:03:32.069> have

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
now when the velvet does not have

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.309 
now when the velvet does not have
electricity<00:03:32.430> running<00:03:33.030> through<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:34.170> air

into the pneumatic actuator instead the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.550 
into the pneumatic actuator instead the
air<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.300> was<00:03:39.420> previously<00:03:39.840> pumped<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.530> there

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
air that was previously pumped in there

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.920 
air that was previously pumped in there
from<00:03:41.010> when<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> was<00:03:41.310> turned<00:03:41.640> on<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.180> able<00:03:42.810> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
from when it was turned on is able to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.229 
from when it was turned on is able to
release<00:03:43.260> through<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> top<00:03:43.950> valve<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.880> right

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
release through the top valve all right

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.030 
release through the top valve all right
now<00:03:45.390> we<00:03:45.450> needed<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.959> way<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.350> control<00:03:46.980> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
now we needed a way to control the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.550 
now we needed a way to control the
valves<00:03:47.670> what<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.450> did<00:03:48.600> was<00:03:48.630> mounted<00:03:49.140> these<00:03:49.319> two

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
valves what we did was mounted these two

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.680 
valves what we did was mounted these two
momentary<00:03:50.220> contact<00:03:50.489> switches<00:03:51.209> in<00:03:51.360> our
