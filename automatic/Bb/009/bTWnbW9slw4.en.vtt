00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
and I got a dremel and finished up some

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.020 
and I got a dremel and finished up some
cutting<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> yeah<00:00:51.470> let's<00:00:52.370> just<00:00:52.489> start<00:00:52.760> by

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
cutting so yeah let's just start by

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.240 
cutting so yeah let's just start by
taking<00:00:53.180> out<00:00:53.330> side<00:00:53.570> panel<00:00:53.900> okay<00:00:54.650> starting<00:00:55.129> from

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
taking out side panel okay starting from

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.510 
taking out side panel okay starting from
the<00:00:55.340> bottom<00:00:55.489> I<00:00:55.850> made<00:00:56.150> a<00:00:56.800> cut<00:00:57.800> here<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.340> cut

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the bottom I made a cut here and a cut

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.430 
the bottom I made a cut here and a cut
here<00:00:58.790> for<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.030> power<00:00:59.270> supply<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.690> draw<00:01:00.110> an<00:01:00.260> air

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
here for the power supply to draw an air

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.590 
here for the power supply to draw an air
this<00:01:01.309> cut<00:01:01.610> here<00:01:01.640> was<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.090> little<00:01:02.180> unnecessary

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
this cut here was a little unnecessary

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.210 
this cut here was a little unnecessary
because<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.409> thought<00:01:03.559> power<00:01:03.800> supply<00:01:04.070> was

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
because I thought power supply was

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.460 
because I thought power supply was
longer<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:04.820> now<00:01:05.510> just<00:01:05.720> adds<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:05.990> little<00:01:06.020> hole

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
longer but now just adds a little hole

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.110 
longer but now just adds a little hole
by<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.220> power<00:01:07.460> supply<00:01:07.640> doesn't<00:01:07.909> look<00:01:08.090> that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
by the power supply doesn't look that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.510 
by the power supply doesn't look that
bad<00:01:10.510> here<00:01:11.510> i<00:01:11.540> added<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> 120mm<00:01:12.860> fan<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.490> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
bad here i added a 120mm fan on the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.300 
bad here i added a 120mm fan on the
bottom<00:01:13.990> it's<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:15.050> pretty<00:01:15.229> rough<00:01:15.470> cut<00:01:15.799> but<00:01:16.070> i<00:01:16.100> did

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
bottom it's a pretty rough cut but i did

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.740 
bottom it's a pretty rough cut but i did
with<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.520> dremel<00:01:16.760> i<00:01:17.060> don't<00:01:17.240> have<00:01:17.330> enough<00:01:17.510> money

fifty dollar hole saw uh yeah so my DS a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.980 
fifty dollar hole saw uh yeah so my DS a
dremel<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.610> doesn't<00:01:25.909> come<00:01:26.030> out<00:01:26.060> as<00:01:26.299> nice<00:01:26.510> as<00:01:26.780> a

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
dremel it doesn't come out as nice as a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.590 
dremel it doesn't come out as nice as a
hole<00:01:27.290> saw<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.700> gets<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> job<00:01:29.060> done<00:01:29.270> that's

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
hole saw but it gets the job done that's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.020 
hole saw but it gets the job done that's
functional<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.860> nobody<00:01:31.460> sees<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.760> bottom

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
functional and nobody sees the bottom

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.149 
functional and nobody sees the bottom
anyway<00:01:32.330> these<00:01:32.990> feet<00:01:33.380> you're<00:01:33.500> looking<00:01:33.799> at<00:01:33.920> I

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
anyway these feet you're looking at I

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.310 
anyway these feet you're looking at I
probably<00:01:35.150> would<00:01:35.360> want<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.690> paint<00:01:35.810> these<00:01:35.960> black

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
probably would want to paint these black

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.320 
probably would want to paint these black
in<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.560> future<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.070> i<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.180> white

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
in the future but i think the white

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.720 
in the future but i think the white
looks<00:01:38.510> pretty<00:01:38.720> cool<00:01:39.400> they're<00:01:40.400> like<00:01:40.580> little

carpet not as good as on hardwood but
like<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.660> desk<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.260> better<00:01:57.470> for<00:01:57.710> if<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.950> have

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100

your<00:01:58.190> case<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.670> carpet<00:01:59.830> okay<00:02:00.940> moving<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.150> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
your case on carpet okay moving to the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.470 
your case on carpet okay moving to the
front<00:02:02.420> you've<00:02:02.900> got<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.200> cable<00:02:03.350> management

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
front you've got the cable management

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.100 
front you've got the cable management
this<00:02:05.480> time<00:02:05.720> around<00:02:07.060> what<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.090> did<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.390> cut<00:02:08.929> off<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
this time around what I did I cut off a

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.770 
this time around what I did I cut off a
little<00:02:09.590> lip<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:11.239> has<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:14.360> there's

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
little lip that has the like there's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.420 
little lip that has the like there's
like<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.050> lift<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.409> holds<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.069> together

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
like a lift that holds like it together

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.790 
like a lift that holds like it together
even<00:02:16.819> though<00:02:16.909> it's<00:02:17.060> not<00:02:17.180> really<00:02:17.360> necessary<00:02:17.800> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
even though it's not really necessary so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.210 
even though it's not really necessary so
I<00:02:18.830> dremel<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.489> off<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.440> tried<00:02:21.440> using<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.830> jigsaw

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
I dremel that off I tried using a jigsaw

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.699 
I dremel that off I tried using a jigsaw
didn't<00:02:22.670> work<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:22.909> too<00:02:23.090> well<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.810> want<00:02:24.650> you

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.720 
didn't work out too well but I want you
to<00:02:24.800> dremel<00:02:25.129> for<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.459> I<00:02:26.890> got<00:02:27.890> another<00:02:28.069> hole<00:02:28.400> up

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
to dremel for that I got another hole up

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.599 
move the cathodes so they're both from
the<00:03:58.040> bottom<00:03:58.449> and<00:03:59.449> the<00:03:59.979> cathode<00:04:00.979> boxes<00:04:01.459> again

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
the bottom and the cathode boxes again

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.080 
the bottom and the cathode boxes again
