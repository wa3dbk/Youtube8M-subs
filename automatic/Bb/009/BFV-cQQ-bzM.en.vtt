namely graphic intensive games and we
believe<00:00:41.680> we<00:00:41.950> succeeded<00:00:42.520> now<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:43.360> can<00:00:43.630> think

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
believe we succeeded now you can think

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.680 
believe we succeeded now you can think
of<00:00:43.930> tango<00:00:44.440> as<00:00:44.680> being<00:00:45.190> just<00:00:45.580> like<00:00:45.670> your<00:00:45.940> Xbox<00:00:46.270> or

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
of tango as being just like your Xbox or

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
of tango as being just like your Xbox or
Playstation<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.309> pocket-sized

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180 

not<00:00:54.060> only<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.600> great<00:00:54.810> system<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:56.010> out

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
not only is it a great system right out

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.720 
not only is it a great system right out
of<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.430> box<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.540> upgradeable<00:00:58.470> just<00:00:59.460> pop

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of the box it's upgradeable just pop

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.900 
of the box it's upgradeable just pop
open<00:00:59.940> tango<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> upgrade<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> RAM<00:01:01.650> or<00:01:01.920> hard

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
open tango and upgrade the RAM or hard

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
open tango and upgrade the RAM or hard
drive<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.410> any<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.800> pc

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

so<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.660> tango<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.370> gaming<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.330> got

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so with tango we think gaming just got

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
so with tango we think gaming just got
more<00:01:09.750> interesting<00:01:12.410> tango<00:01:13.410> may<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.740> small<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
more interesting tango may be small but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
more interesting tango may be small but
