that it was 110 only but here it is I
just<00:01:37.920> need<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.160> connect<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.090> my<00:01:39.270> network

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
just need to connect it up to my network

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.280 
just need to connect it up to my network
here<00:01:40.940> but<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.480> here<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.870> working

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
here but you see here here it is working

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
here but you see here here it is working
on<00:01:43.440> 220<00:01:44.600> volts<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.480> US

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
on 220 volts so now you know that the US

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
on 220 volts so now you know that the US
version<00:01:51.110> which<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.320> region-free

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
version which is region-free

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
version which is region-free
is<00:01:53.670> also<00:01:54.890> voltage<00:01:55.890> switching<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.660> run

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
is also voltage switching so you can run

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.940 
is also voltage switching so you can run
it<00:01:57.870> anywhere<00:01:58.320> from<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.830> believe<00:01:58.970> 100<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.950> 240

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it anywhere from I believe 100 to 240

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.840 
it anywhere from I believe 100 to 240
volts<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.190> way<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.370> understand<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.740 

all<00:02:11.420> right<00:02:11.600> I'm<00:02:11.810> gonna<00:02:11.930> go<00:02:12.050> do<00:02:12.200> some<00:02:12.260> gaming
