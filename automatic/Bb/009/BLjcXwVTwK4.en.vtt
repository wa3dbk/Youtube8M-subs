00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.330
 In the field over the river 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.330

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.570
 Based on this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 I'm thinking of increasing it 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.860
 Instead of digging and planting a hole 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.400

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.210
 This asparagus 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.480
 Lots of stones under stock seedlings 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.010
 By applying the method of 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.420

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.880
 It is a cookie 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
 It will be Otsu 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.760
 It's also good at stone 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.520
 Oh dear 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.100
 What is a plant-based substitute for a doctor 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.110
 As 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.619
 Because there was something written yesterday 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.619
 here 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:21.000
 It was placed in the middle, and I put Paspara on it . 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.480
 This is also true 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.440
 I have a back chest 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.860
 Spread 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.820
 State 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.820
 The reason why 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.960
 High 2 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.560
 from now on 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.090
 It is covered with soil, is n't it? 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.090
 Don't dig and bury the holes 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.440
 Flower culti 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.440
 Together with the planting method 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.080
 The existing soil is as it is 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.300
 Leave 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.560
 On the root 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.520
 Covering the soil 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.000
 I'm thinking of trying to do it 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.000
 there 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.400
 It's over there 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.650
 To seal woven pot 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.210
 Since put mouth is not to Do not pick on the moon because there are a lot 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.860
 Even if you do not have ana book 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.470
 After regarded as the month for the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.840
 If you put on to cover the soil 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:12.209
 I think that I can do it 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.209
 Although the house of the vineyard I Petit is not pressed not is to dig a hole because it is already soft 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:19.530
 Hard 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.130
 If it was a field of soil for the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.130
 In this way 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.960
 On topsoil that already exists

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.449
 Covering the soil 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:44.720
 It means that you should bring it from near or at another place 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.169
 Not be taken in this 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.360

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.510

 It is in a state of being 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.320
 Still 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.810
