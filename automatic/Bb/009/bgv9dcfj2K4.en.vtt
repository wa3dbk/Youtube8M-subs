00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.590
 Aachen reacted to another act 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.239
 and at the cake buffet 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:14.200
 Mainz ddp more Michael Phelps turn down individual trade June 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.380
 what he can do already folded and also the coveted as in the right one 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.849
 then do the lips to improvise properly 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.689
 the streets 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.330
 if she is Tacheles 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.720
 what you all in the parking garage 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.789
 has learned 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 and that is reasonably able to handle these too 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.040
 Willy Astor on the boards 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 I already feel like I'm a personal 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.180
 Saxony Döbeln must wonder sentences like I am 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.220
 first of all 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.190
 Picture de 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.000
 Lothar 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 they advise 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.620
 our interest is him 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.620
 have fought well 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.410
 in the city hall on the 8th 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.850
 so I have 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.320
 and so will he from Astra at ISE 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 refurbish 5 0 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.270
 and that is why we concretely concreted several 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.830
 and how were the first five minutes on 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.990
 The report action is definitely there 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.470
 that must be remembered the colorful still remembers 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.760
 starts during the week in the first ballot 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.780
 for example, left his forehead 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.950
 knowing that the speech is 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.470
 we did that 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 why the idea again comes first 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.710
 so guess why read this here 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.000
 how it will turn out 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 if you all assange the sound is an end 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 2 It will certainly be the charts again 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.800
 as follows 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.800
 the mirror is her fate herself first hand 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.349
 then as a worldly winger 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.609
 for the front door this is Waltz 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.609
 For example, it could be here along 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.429
 that was about 12 000 members 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.389
 the Least One 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.229
 that's 2 1 percent 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.149
 Characteristic is no loss 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.149
 third is Kachelmanns 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.719
 drop by that 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.590
 then the easiest method to practice the whole thing is simple 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.859
 sometimes a double outnumber 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.359
 for example NBA 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.359
 the Grand Prix 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.199
 No, finally help is a serious one 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.089
 a fanciful vest the game of the opponent I neglected further back missing 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.319
 Limbs on 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.099
 how all fit to be the same 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.969
 he has a dog at all 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.279
 previously Hufnagel was a success yes to say 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.779
 less success 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:32.449
 So what good is the first time anchoring torn IBM are wanted 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.339
 Mandy Moore already knows his practical meaning by heart 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.339
 I have been acclaimed for foreigners 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.139
 the manufacturer is orphaned 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.799
 that's four times 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:45.670
 Dr 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.730
 Duca Pestoni that surpassing two parties is just something 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.919
 even today 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.830
 it means elected for example 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.659
 an artillery shell was talked a lot 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.309
 I would be here 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.309
 if you have two passers-by 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.429
 two abstentions 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.299
 Sellstedt 2 2 from 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.500
 that had blamed the disaster 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.440
 she indicates 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.769
 and so on 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.380
 you can not do any such stuff here, but you can also take breaks around it 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.239
 always check 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.239
 like the partners Leander Morgenpost 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.270
 I understand one day explain 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.919
 Sierre tutoria other talk we do has lies 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.069
 which exactly a terrace with and overcame tomatoes 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.229
 and unlike you could not slam into time 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.080
 outside all dams broke with the respective parallels world 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 hug listed 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.650
 now the Energiewende Toni Hilti Group a plays 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.650
 and installed the web on the fingerboard to a source 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.819
 So I'll think of it and silver as a vase 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:01.719
 Müller continues 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.110
 In the beginning, not only are many possibilities offered by Mollis gl 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.009
 Argos in addition to the round did their job well 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.009
 in many ways 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.460
 Season celebrated and next bottle of men learn how GE Healthcare stayed 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.889

 to finance and break the cultivation 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.650
 and also give a speech 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.249
 and the Mantra Monastery Ettal 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.729

 with Alfred Kruger 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:47.810
 how much meat like Tartar
