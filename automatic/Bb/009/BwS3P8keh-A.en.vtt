00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now let's switch over to someone who is

now let's switch over to someone who is
prestige<00:01:19.290> master<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.430> his<00:01:20.520> stats<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
prestige master you see his stats and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609 
prestige master you see his stats and
the<00:01:21.180> prestige<00:01:21.420> master<00:01:21.659> emblem<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.530> we

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the prestige master emblem but if we

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.230 
the prestige master emblem but if we
zoom<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> same<00:01:23.670> emblem<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
zoom in we see the same emblem that I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240

circle<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.840> second<00:01:25.200> ago<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.950> alone

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
circle just a second ago and this alone

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.590 
circle just a second ago and this alone
i<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.640> safe<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.820> say<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.390> will

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
i think it's safe to say that there will

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
i think it's safe to say that there will
be<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:27.960> prestigious<00:01:28.380> after<00:01:28.890> prestige

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
be more prestigious after prestige

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
be more prestigious after prestige

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
master what a morning though is if you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.390
