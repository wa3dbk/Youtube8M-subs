make<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> cross<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.960> stalker<00:00:40.230> or<00:00:40.649> anything<00:00:40.920> so

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 

so<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.520> didn't<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.820> dream<00:00:45.030> there's<00:00:45.240> no

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
chance of that they put a guard never I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.490 
chance of that they put a guard never I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
but i think there are you encouraged by
the<00:01:14.070> fact<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.580> happen<00:01:14.940> anyway<00:01:15.660> after

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the fact that would happen anyway after

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.280 
the fact that would happen anyway after
with<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> training<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
with the kind of training then it's a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.020 
with the kind of training then it's a
girl<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.760> a<00:01:20.940> reverse<00:01:22.580> just<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
girl that was like a reverse just you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
girl that was like a reverse just you
