though if you want to go and watch the
form<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:45.900> think<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.440> form<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.800> waste

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
form I don't think the form is a waste

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
form I don't think the form is a waste
of<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.760> think<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.330> see<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.630> brilliant

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of time I think you see some brilliant

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.380 
of time I think you see some brilliant
performances<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:50.130> also<00:01:50.370> introduces<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> to

performances it also introduces you to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.270 
performances it also introduces you to
I'd<00:01:51.900> say<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> different<00:01:52.470> style<00:01:52.800> of<00:01:52.890> cinema

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
I'd say a different style of cinema

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.040 
I'd say a different style of cinema
maybe<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:54.030> well<00:01:54.420> they're<00:01:54.570> usually<00:01:54.720> known

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
maybe because well they're usually known

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.410 
maybe because well they're usually known
