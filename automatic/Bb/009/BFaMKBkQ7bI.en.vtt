to build the never pool without using a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
to build the never pool without using a
pickaxe<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.570> i<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> stone<00:00:19.890> one

one bucket of water you might want to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
one bucket of water you might want to
choose<00:00:34.260> two<00:00:34.500> buckets<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> water<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.940> case

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
choose two buckets of water just in case

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.119 
choose two buckets of water just in case
if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.450> accidentally<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.170> turn<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.920> into

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
if you accidentally like turn that into

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
if you accidentally like turn that into
obsidian<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> dig

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
obsidian but first off you want to dig

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.959 
obsidian but first off you want to dig
for<00:00:40.140> holes<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.070> ground<00:00:41.160> look<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.700> here

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
for holes in the ground look I have here

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.479 
for holes in the ground look I have here
and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and then you want to go to here where I

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
and then you want to go to here where I
do<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.059> place<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.690> bucket<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> water<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.800> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
do and place a bucket of water down so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
do and place a bucket of water down so
it<00:00:47.100> turns<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.550> into<00:00:47.820> obsidian<00:00:48.059> once<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it turns all into obsidian once you have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.690 
it turns all into obsidian once you have
done<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> easiest

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
done that that's probably the easiest

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
done that that's probably the easiest
part<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.960> very<00:00:52.110> hard<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
part of this it's not very hard to do it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.680 
part of this it's not very hard to do it
just<00:00:52.890> takes<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> time<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
just takes up a lot of time and you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
just takes up a lot of time and you
might<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:54.960> well<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.070> diamonds

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
might as well just get some diamonds

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
might as well just get some diamonds
really<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> build<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.600> normally<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
really and build one normally but you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
really and build one normally but you
just<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> build<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:01:00.059> block<00:01:00.270> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just want to build a little block like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
just want to build a little block like
this<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:00.930> place<00:01:01.170> lava<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this so you can place lava in it and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.359 
this so you can place lava in it and
then<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.799> done<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> put

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
then you want to do done you want to put

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
then you want to do done you want to put
water<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> then

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
water on the side look I have and then

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
water on the side look I have and then
do<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.090> over<00:01:09.210> again<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.900> don't

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
do that over and over again if you don't

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
do that over and over again if you don't
like<00:01:10.229> free<00:01:10.470> time<00:01:10.740> too<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.460> you've<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.790> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
like free time too then you've got like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.260 
like free time too then you've got like
one<00:01:12.659> level<00:01:13.049> higher<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:14.010> high<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> then

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
one level higher as high as that then

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.600 
one level higher as high as that then
you<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.509> another<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.159> just

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
you put another one in and then you just

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.060 
you put another one in and then you just
keep<00:01:17.790> repeating<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.770> need<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> do

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
keep repeating that one you need to do

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.340 
keep repeating that one you need to do
it<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.900> does<00:01:22.110> take<00:01:22.320> up

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it again so it just it does take up

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
it again so it just it does take up
quite<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> time<00:01:23.130> guys<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.479> quite

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
quite a lot of time guys but it's quite

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.230 
quite a lot of time guys but it's quite
cool<00:01:25.470> trick<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> someone<00:01:26.250> did<00:01:26.400> ask<00:01:26.729> me<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> do

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
cool trick and someone did ask me to do

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
cool trick and someone did ask me to do
it<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.630> thought<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.869> look<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> comment<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
it and I thought I look to a comment and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
it and I thought I look to a comment and
I<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:29.970> even<00:01:30.119> possible<00:01:30.390> but

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I was like it's not even possible but

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
I was like it's not even possible but
then<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> researched<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.579> once

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
then I researched it and it was so once

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.190 
then I researched it and it was so once
you<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> part<00:01:33.570> done<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> want<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:36.200> build

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you get this part done you want to build

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310 
you get this part done you want to build
outwards<00:01:37.890> roll<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.700> outwards<00:01:39.240> towards<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
outwards roll up outwards towards the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
outwards roll up outwards towards the
way<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> you've<00:01:40.920> done<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
way that you've done the one on the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.950 
way that you've done the one on the
floor<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> am<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:44.240> then<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
floor like I am here then you want to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
floor like I am here then you want to
build<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> bridge<00:01:46.860> I'm<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.640> looking

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
build like a bridge I'm just looking

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
build like a bridge I'm just looking
what<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:49.890> much

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
what to do just want to pretty much

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.850 
what to do just want to pretty much
build<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> bridge<00:01:50.579> once<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.860> now

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
build a bridge once you get back up now

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.130 
build a bridge once you get back up now
it<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it would like this just want to do the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.510 
it would like this just want to do the
shift<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.799> where<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> click<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
shift thing where you click in the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
shift thing where you click in the
analog<00:01:56.820> i'm<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> make<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
analog i'm going to make sure you get it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.620 
analog i'm going to make sure you get it
to<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.590> level<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.390> want<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to the right level and then you want to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.010 
to the right level and then you want to
build<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:02.000> say<00:02:03.000> like<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.210> fence<00:02:03.540> around<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
build like a say like a fence around it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.920 
build like a say like a fence around it
but<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> sense<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> stone

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
but it's not a sense it's out of stone

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.229 
but it's not a sense it's out of stone
so<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.469> lover<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
so you can put lover in here then you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.600 
so you can put lover in here then you
want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> build<00:02:09.899> an<00:02:10.200> edge<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> lava

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
want to build an edge bit so the lava

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.140 
want to build an edge bit so the lava
doesn't<00:02:11.819> fall<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.209> off<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
doesn't fall it off like this I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
doesn't fall it off like this I
you've<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.540> like<00:02:13.629> a<00:02:13.689> little<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:14.170> bathtub<00:02:14.860> out

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you've got like a little a bathtub out

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.240 
you've got like a little a bathtub out
of<00:02:15.430> stone<00:02:15.700> they're<00:02:16.239> going<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> put<00:02:16.659> some<00:02:17.250> hot

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of stone they're going to put some hot

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.369 
of stone they're going to put some hot
lava<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.849> there<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.239> can't<00:02:19.420> believe<00:02:19.569> Bay

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
lava in there so you can't believe Bay

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.809 
lava in there so you can't believe Bay
them<00:02:20.650> there<00:02:20.829> then<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:21.579> do<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.760> same

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
them there then you just do the same

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.399 
them there then you just do the same
thing<00:02:22.239> again<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.659> you<00:02:22.720> did<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.140> bottom

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
thing again like you did on the bottom

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.610 
thing again like you did on the bottom
level<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:24.730> keep<00:02:24.909> placing<00:02:25.150> them<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.590> then

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
level just keep placing them in and then

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.000 
level just keep placing them in and then
you<00:02:27.480> do<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.659> water<00:02:28.870> trick<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.709> showed<00:02:29.980> you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
you do the water trick that I showed you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.369 
you do the water trick that I showed you
on<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.250> first<00:02:30.459> one<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.359> come<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.810> any<00:02:32.109> of

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
on the first one so you come to any of

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.929 
on the first one so you come to any of
the<00:02:32.530> sites<00:02:32.739> don't<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.370> particularly<00:02:33.790> be

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
the sites don't have to particularly be

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.990 
the sites don't have to particularly be
this<00:02:34.120> side<00:02:34.329> get<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.140> other<00:02:35.230> side<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:36.000> fall

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
this side get on the other side I fall

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.520 
this side get on the other side I fall
off<00:02:37.180> here<00:02:37.359> because<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.629> was<00:02:37.780> shift<00:02:38.019> in<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
off here because I was shift in and I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.069 
off here because I was shift in and I
didn't<00:02:38.799> realize<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.480> know<00:02:40.689> it's<00:02:40.840> not<00:02:40.930> really

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
didn't realize you know it's not really

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.720 
didn't realize you know it's not really
possible<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.680> run<00:02:41.829> off<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:41.980> shift<00:02:42.370> them<00:02:42.549> but

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
possible to run off and shift them but

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
possible to run off and shift them but
the<00:02:42.790> warp<00:02:42.819> fishman<00:02:43.359> off<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.680> then<00:02:44.680> once

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
the warp fishman off and then once

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.680 
the warp fishman off and then once
you've<00:02:45.370> done<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.579> if<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.209> haven't<00:02:46.569> got

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you've done that if you haven't got

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.390 
you've done that if you haven't got
enough<00:02:46.780> love<00:02:47.139> or<00:02:47.349> like<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.620> didn't<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.159> had<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
enough love or like I didn't I had to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.490 
enough love or like I didn't I had to
run<00:02:48.579> down<00:02:48.609> and<00:02:48.970> get<00:02:49.060> some<00:02:49.120> more<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:49.989> speed<00:02:50.319> up

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
run down and get some more so I speed up

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800 
run down and get some more so I speed up
in<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.739> second<00:02:51.159> to<00:02:51.459> actually<00:02:51.790> go<00:02:52.389> and<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.599> some

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
in a second to actually go and get some

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.259 
in a second to actually go and get some
more<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.889> I'd<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.310> kept<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.849> bit<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.180> here

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
more so I'd like kept this bit in here

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.030 
more so I'd like kept this bit in here
so<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.540> guys<00:02:55.780> didn't<00:02:56.139> like<00:02:56.530> think<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:56.920> was

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
so you guys didn't like think I was

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.800 
so you guys didn't like think I was
cheating<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.549> actually<00:02:57.939> using<00:02:58.090> diamonds<00:02:58.689> but

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
I do end up getting a stone pickaxe to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.319 
I do end up getting a stone pickaxe to
destroy<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.530> stone<00:03:02.769> around<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:04.150> it's

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
destroy the stone around it but it's

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.179

quite<00:03:04.510> cool<00:03:04.689> as<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.139> see<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.409> my<00:03:05.590> slime<00:03:05.829> spawn

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
quite cool as you see as my slime spawn

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.890 
quite cool as you see as my slime spawn
of<00:03:06.220> absolutely<00:03:06.790> failed<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.840> in

a slime area just want to fill up loads

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.069 
a slime area just want to fill up loads
of<00:03:10.750> buckets<00:03:11.109> I<00:03:11.290> fall<00:03:12.250> in<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.790> minute<00:03:13.079> it's
