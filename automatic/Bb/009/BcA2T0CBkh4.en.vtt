00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.050
 the mistakes that make us age at 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.090
 makeup are many the first 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.470
 it is not to apply care before 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.020
 to apply her makeup while 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.790
 simply because the care is really going 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.849
 prepare your skin beyond the fact 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.560
 that they act throughout the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.240
 day all night long and on 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.580
 of the long run obviously he very 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.820
 important to prepare the skin texture 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.650
 to accommodate other materials so 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.000
 very important to prepare your skin 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.040
 work your eye contour 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.110
 work your lip texture 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.940
 also after the second mistake 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.830
 this is the overload the overload on the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.379
 dyes foundation overload well 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.120
 sure powder charge anti overload 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.260
 dark circles 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.479
 it's not because we had more than 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.479
 it's more efficient so work and a 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.790
 in transparency work of the powder in 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.309
 lightness and work of the anti-dark circles or 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.869
 good place in very small amount 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.699
 see through makeup when we have 15 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.650
 years old and funny so actually plays the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.530
 overload and it works it seems 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.869
 bigger but when you're mature or 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.060
 when we are over 40 years old for the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.159
 blow we do not want at all and in this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.719
 case we will make a choice because 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.789
 to choose is to give up she will choose 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.469
 where the look or the lips 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.390
 for example today I'm wearing a 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.000
 rather charged look quite smoky 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.609
 I chose to make lips rather 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.990
 beige and wise in case I would have 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.990
 chose to make a mouth very red 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.609
 I would have chosen instead of charge and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.770
 maybe only my mascara and 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:34.659
 to apply a beige lighthouse or make-up 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.399
 clear on the eyelids 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.969
 another mistake that women make 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.479
 these slabs and textures is and their 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.039
 eyelids so often we hear about 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.829
 eye shadow matt of eye 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.860
 pearly eyelids one is bad the other 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.620
 and better in fact 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 I consider myself that one and the other 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.950
 can work everything depends on the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.970
 way we're going to apply it mostly to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.890
 the quantity we will choose 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.900
 I have a small preference anyway 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 for lighthouses did not create because the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.230
 pharma you will still wither even in 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.630
 small quantity 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.950
 the eyelid while the pearly eye shadow so 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 we always work on the back of the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.820
 hand and then we will apply it in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 tapping one will only drop a veil of 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.410
 mother of pearl and light without effects 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.240
 matter so no overload of blushes to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.890
 eyelids and textures on 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.970
 eyelids 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.580
 another mistake that women make in 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.709
 general is to emphasize 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.970
 systematically the underside of the eye 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.220
 Pay attention 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.280
 everyone does not have the almond eyes 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.140
 and it is obvious that the eyes already round 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.140
 and the older we get in the older the eye 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.180
 falls a little bit if we will emphasize 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 with a line we will accentuate what 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.180
 it's called the little upside down 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.310
 of the eye so I advise you to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.780
 focus on the top of the eye on 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.790
 flush upper lashes and 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.530
 potentially makeup a whole 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.270
 little bit the outer corner but without 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 overload just to dress it up and 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.210
 to fill it up avoid digging too much 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.480
 face also because 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.520
 some of us are deepening and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.230
 so put the blush in the hollow of the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.140
 cheek will accentuate this digging and is going 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.410
 give a much more emaciated side 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.450
 much older age prefer rather 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.010
 the top of the cheekbone and to finish 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.080
 on the lips of course before 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.460
 to apply a lipstick we 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.700
 always remained your lips because a 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.560
 matte or satin lipstick high 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.710
 brion on lips that anyway 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.480
 his wither is dry and parched go 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.720
 give you even more appearance 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.490
 to dry out and aged the lip then 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.620
 very important well to feed her make it 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.190
 flexible and once she is well 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.490
 watch your lipstick work 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.710
 by tapping if you are a real 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.060
 fans of the real move well 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.470
 designed to avoid the mark too 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.380
 and to make lip contour 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.940
 honest because or so privilege 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.920
 only the commissures because 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.440
 you will close your mouth in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.240
 a drawing you go the fine and a whole 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.110
 little bit of nanars a little pinch and 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.910
 you 're going to have that hardened sensation 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.980
 this hardened earth that will also you 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.890
 to age so somehow we 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.100
 could sum it all up by saying that 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.210
 if you go overboard whatever that 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.660
 excess we will grow old 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.660
 here
