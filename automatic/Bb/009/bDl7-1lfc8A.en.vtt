00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.020 
little bit different you're just gonna
go<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:36.800> and<00:02:37.010> put<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.430> on<00:02:37.640> there's<00:02:37.880> no

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
go like that and put it on there's no

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.960 
go like that and put it on there's no
loops<00:02:38.300> or<00:02:38.510> anything<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.900> put<00:02:39.080> through<00:02:39.970> so

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
loops or anything to put through so

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.890 
loops or anything to put through so
these<00:02:41.090> are<00:02:41.270> nice<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.140> like<00:02:42.290> these

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
I'll just show you what it looks like

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.170 
I'll just show you what it looks like
when<00:02:46.400> they're<00:02:46.490> on<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:50.500> can<00:02:51.500> tell<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.790> lot<00:02:53.030> of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
when they're on I can tell it's a lot of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.580 
when they're on I can tell it's a lot of
more<00:02:53.390> flexibility<00:02:54.110> than<00:02:54.140> normal<00:02:54.590> once<00:02:56.590> then

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
more flexibility than normal once then

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.520 
more flexibility than normal once then
you'll<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.870> do<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.080> right<00:03:00.230> way<00:03:00.290> of

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.470 
you'll just do it the right way of
course<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:02.000> around<00:03:04.150> put<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.209> through<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.420> loop

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
course go around put it through the loop

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.570 
course go around put it through the loop
right<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.190> looks<00:03:07.340> really

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580
