00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 on the capital of mali it's a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.660
 threat to all who love the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.590
 freedom 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.280
 this saved the sovereignty 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.700

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.600
 we also cooperate with states 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.120
 of the cemac de l'aserc and the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.090
 French troops to stabilize the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.430
 situation in the Central African Republic 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 we talked about all this and above all 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.040
 and also we have at ocam we are 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.410
 launched in a vast program of 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.370
 modernization or all roads ports 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.520
 airports and his deputies if we 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.890
 have come to ask men 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.770
 French business to come and participate 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 to this great development movement 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.230
 that we launched against the press 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.140
 massively arrived at his 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.500
 encounter for the bia displays a form 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.450
 dazzling and an availability to 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 any test 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.140
 he does not elude any questions and I look 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.140
 if tired 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.569
 the problem ultimately is not my 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.879
 problem but I can not support it 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.060
 by France it's the people 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.290
 Cameroonians who bleat him in the middle of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.900
 twenty or thirty other candidates then 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 obviously nobody is eternal but 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.140
 what concerns me m 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.390
 it is stupid of the word mandate and hold the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.489
 commitments I took the exchange of 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.920
 paul biya with the press in the courtyard 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.650
 of honor of the elysée is a great 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.810
 communication operation by his 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.849
 mastery of subjects the head of state 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.670
 Cameroonian sprays clichés and 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.400
 other prejudices about Cameroon before 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.290
 in the problem does not give the man 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.720
 a country we say a lot but 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.420
 Cameroonians are clever and that makes 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.959
 that she is freer and how many 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.180
 newspapers about twenty such is the 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.690
 broadcast radios there is no censorship 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.360
 the data are not tortures case not 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.790
 of disappearance 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.569
 I know there are people who 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.730
 commit crimes and who to do 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.690
 good figure discussion is taken at 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.000
 politics 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.769
 when you misappropriated funds and 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.350
 that the courts condemn 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.479
 what do you want us to do we 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.729
 a country has no political prisoners 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.229
 and with bare hands when you people without 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:33.830
 we have more than 200 parties that 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.139
 deal with 17 cases when paul biya 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.289
 fate of the palace of the elysée 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.750
 at 15:58 the dark areas on the 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.720
 Cameroonian realities are lifted the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.419
 france can count on cameroon 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.770
 this visit of president biya in France 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.770
 is already a great success
