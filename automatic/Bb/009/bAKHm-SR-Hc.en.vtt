00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.660
 I am from the corner of the kick and good 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.120
 this time we are going to make a super head 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.030
 pumpkin when you want pumpkins with 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.500
 the ones you have halloween pretty much what 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.540
 What are you going to do now 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.610
 I can do the head of where 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.500
 it's just I hope it's like a 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.110
 second pumpkin when halloween 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.240
 more or less exactly that but with a 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.160
 lens so they go to star guys 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.689
 now I could order candy with new from 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.640
 minecraft I think it can be something very 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.440
 original so good materials 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.300
 are the following for this character 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.129
 we need felt this filter is a 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.290
 antenna material a bit hard I like 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.790
 be because the assistant have in 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.379
 account that badly lights go away but to 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 regret and you need to have resistance 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.210
 to your bag so they ask for black felt 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.160
 here is that is also your felt 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 violet that will be for the eyes 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.600
 you really need a little bit of this 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.040
 it is already with half a meter has I asked 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.350
 one but because I love having a 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.329
 lots of extra material and I'm sure 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 half a meter more internal to the eyes 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.030
 black color a little bit of green felt 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.039
 basically a half spends a quarter 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.320
 dallas that looks very little and well a 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.450
 little bit of felt coffee stamped on the 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.620
 little box that I was going to wear your wender in 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.960
 hands scissors liquid silicone 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.610
 and if you want a white hit because 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.980
 you are doing an expansion for the eyes 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.710
 of the leander but good is optional as well 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.120
 that well let's see how we get 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.620
 well basically the mold is a 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.570
 square as a base as you can see 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.010
 exactly one square and the parts of 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.590
 the sides are going to be a little bit like 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.030
 half round rhombuses not the part of 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.950
 up is going to be smaller and the part 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.080
 below it will be more square so that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 it has a medium circle shape 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.010
 square circular so that's how it goes 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.040
 to stay and now we are going to have to sew 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.050
 what are the bottom parts of those of 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.270
 the sides to the base with our thread 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.950
 black now we grab one of the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.970
 side and we make some holes that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.680
 are going to be the eyes 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.990
 finally we cut with the squares 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.560
 violets and we pay them with our being and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.300
 with liquid as simple as that easy 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.010
 now as we can see simply we 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.960
 will be in what is the lateral 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.700
 ready so that once we passed it to the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.440
 basis once the base is sewn 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.060
 we are going to finish hitting or better said 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.890
 sew all the corners all the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.080
 lateral to the base and then we go to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.090
 put all the sides in each corner 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.070
 so that this is how our 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.540
 ready to be our 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.819
 candy container 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.599
 good guys once you have your 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.730
 picture your box in mind all the 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.370
 borders basically these go to the little 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.049
 it appears that the eyes are stuck by 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.969
 out because then we're going to go around 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.689
 and I said a little bit about the return to 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.510
 top part 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.079
 there are guys now we have our 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.980
 two pieces of new felt banobras and 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.829
 like half 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.349
 these two points will paste the manolas 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.480
 to the thing and then this is going to sew in 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.400
 the part of the edges so you can 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 to be handle not from here you're going to give the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.680
 bag will do exactly the same to 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 half is together and what more 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.129
 exactly when things are happening 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.209
 exactly accomplished is better than 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.120
 they sew because they become more resistant 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.919
 european you will like it easy and now 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 as I said, you just put on 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.150
 sew what are the veins heals for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.099
 your basket now follows the part of the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.810
 body sell but let's prepare what 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.909
 which is stumbling successes that are part 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.650
 on the right and the two long ones are going to be 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.209
 the little hands just as simple 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.060
 cut out what you do not need anything more than a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.440
 piece of felt cut in this way 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.239
 this the demanding seam that I'm going to 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.520
 teach you just do a zig zag 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.200
 but to do it from below 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.610
 when you are passing the thread not like this 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.250
 you are simply going to create a style of 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.790
 sewing with a line crossed like 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.170
 the previous ones is very decorative 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.090
 now you just have to grab a 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.310
 violet fig and you start to tackle all 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.109
 the edge of the part of your basket is very 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.430
 pretty because it's going to make you this 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.500
 hold firm so you're not 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.329
 closing every little while and you can see 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.069
 very decorative when once we have 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.310
 finished our sewing will look something 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.290
 as well as a line up and for 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.629
 this side like that so just now 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.370
 we have these tied the posture costs 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:03.170
 40 that this is flipped over so what 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.390
 only thing that is missing is to turn it around 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.660
 now it's time to see the return to your 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.660
 is 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.920
 simply what you already see is grab 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.750
 the body 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.609
 and meet him 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.799
 this part you have to ensure that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.900
 want exactly in the center and watching 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.820
 from the face all the figures 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.790
 which also establishes part of the center 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.280
 from your base 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.110
 Now you take a cube a square of 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.850
 coffee color and what is the part of 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.500
 up that I like to be like 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.300
 grid that is going to be part of the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.940
 grass so it's going to be the block that 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.310
 will take your ndr in your hands and you will 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.900
 to stick with liquid silicone and to 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.820
 simply finish what you do is 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.650
 take out your blocks you stick to the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.930
 hands and then this block you stick to the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.760
 feet and finally you have your on the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.500
 finished and good guys here is your 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.720
 whole bag and it's just going to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 will be to end the grab 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.220
 top part and they're just going to 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.410
 take well 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.300
 this is going to be full full of things in 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.090
 the bottom part we recognized what they are 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.130
 Handymen the part of the picture it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.930
 we put and then we hit what is the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.300
 picture to the ten hits with silicone 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.220
 liquid and so it is on this side when 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.720
 they turn around he stays here but 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.130
 this is simply stuck in the 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.660
 little legs so that the hands that see 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.400
 hanging like this and you see that they are carrying 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.870
 your hose block so good 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.940
