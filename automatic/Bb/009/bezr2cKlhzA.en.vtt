whenever I take Thresh lantern so we

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
whenever I take Thresh lantern so we
switch<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> up<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.330> zillion

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
switch it up and this time use zillion

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
switch it up and this time use zillion
and<00:01:21.930> J's<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.560> increase<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.100> move<00:01:23.340> speed

and J's to increase my move speed

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
and J's to increase my move speed
distance<00:01:23.970> putting<00:01:24.450> me<00:01:24.570> farther<00:01:24.869> away<00:01:25.140> from

the<00:01:25.650> initial<00:01:25.920> blades<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.939> time<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.299> I'm

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the initial blades and this time as I'm

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450 
the initial blades and this time as I'm
jogging<00:01:27.810> away<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.470> initial<00:01:28.740> location<00:01:29.040> at

jogging away from my initial location at

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940 
jogging away from my initial location at
the<00:01:29.579> base<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> few<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> blades<00:01:31.560> seem

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the base only a few of the blades seem

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.800 
the base only a few of the blades seem
to<00:01:32.130> fly<00:01:32.310> back<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> me<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> looking<00:01:33.329> back<00:01:33.600> at

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to fly back to me and looking back at

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.240 
to fly back to me and looking back at
the<00:01:33.900> base<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.619> some<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> blades

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the base you can see some of the blades

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.039 
the base you can see some of the blades
are<00:01:35.369> still<00:01:35.700> floating<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> air<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
are still floating in the air kind of

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
are still floating in the air kind of
like<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.350> glitched<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
like they glitched out so this is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
like they glitched out so this is
actually<00:01:38.729> quite<00:01:39.060> interesting<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> somewhat

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually quite interesting and somewhat

actually quite interesting and somewhat

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of a bug hopefully this is fixed pretty

unaware mordekaiser his stats go towards

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.179 
unaware mordekaiser his stats go towards
the<00:01:54.840> ghost<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.409> he<00:01:55.530> creates<00:01:55.920> from<00:01:56.070> his

the ghost that he creates from his

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
the ghost that he creates from his
ultimate<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.790> order<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> buff<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.750> even

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
ultimate in order to buff it up even

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
ultimate in order to buff it up even
more<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> question<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> stats

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
more but the question is are the stats

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
more but the question is are the stats
on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.060> ghost<00:02:00.329> dynamic<00:02:01.110> AKA<00:02:01.469> they<00:02:01.829> changed

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
on the ghost dynamic AKA they changed

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.310 
on the ghost dynamic AKA they changed
based<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> items<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.570> are<00:02:04.020> they

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
based on the items you have or are they

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.139 
based on the items you have or are they
simply<00:02:04.380> static<00:02:05.310> meaty<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:05.909> change

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
simply static meaty they don't change

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
simply static meaty they don't change
are<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> same<00:02:06.780> based<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.350> stats<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.950> you

for<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.440> we're<00:02:34.590> checking<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.070> thrush

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
for this one we're checking if thrush

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.710 
for this one we're checking if thrush
can<00:02:35.490> even<00:02:35.670> hook<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.970> through<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.240> ultimate

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
can even hook me through the ultimate

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
can even hook me through the ultimate
and<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.650> he<00:02:37.740> fly<00:02:37.920> through<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and if so can he fly through the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
and if so can he fly through the
ultimate<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:39.360> right<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.630> top<00:02:39.810> of<00:02:39.840> me<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.410> you

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
ultimate to go right on top of me so you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.660 
ultimate to go right on top of me so you
can<00:02:40.710> definitely<00:02:41.070> hook<00:02:41.190> me<00:02:41.370> through<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can definitely hook me through the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.460 
can definitely hook me through the
ultimate<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.240> as<00:02:42.390> he<00:02:42.540> tries<00:02:42.750> flying<00:02:43.110> towards

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
ultimate but as he tries flying towards

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.530 
ultimate but as he tries flying towards
me<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> soldiers<00:02:44.160> still<00:02:44.430> stop<00:02:44.790> him<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.360> make

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
me the soldiers still stop him and make

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.150 
me the soldiers still stop him and make
the<00:02:45.660> death<00:02:45.840> sentence<00:02:46.290> look<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.710> like<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> life

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the death sentence look more like a life

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.010 
the death sentence look more like a life
sentence<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.850> next<00:02:48.570> we<00:02:48.660> were<00:02:48.780> kind<00:02:48.960> of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
sentence and next we were kind of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.450 
sentence and next we were kind of
curious<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> see<00:02:49.620> how<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.070> will<00:02:50.190> work<00:02:50.220> with

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
curious to see how it will work with

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.580 
curious to see how it will work with
rengar<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.120> passive<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.780> jump<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
rengar is passive the jump so the
