now as you see here clefable we've
already<00:01:32.400> talked<00:01:32.700> about<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.360> being<00:01:33.689> with

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
already talked about with being with

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
already talked about with being with
Gengar<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.470> somebody<00:01:34.860> might<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.400> known

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
Gengar but somebody might not have known

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.499 
Gengar but somebody might not have known
is<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:37.070> Voltorb<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> possessed

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
is that Voltorb is just a possessed

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
is that Voltorb is just a possessed
pokeball<00:01:40.140> he's<00:01:40.380> possessed<00:01:40.770> by<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.340> ghost<00:01:41.700> or

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
pokeball he's possessed by a ghost or

hunter who has possessed this hawk vol

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.940 
hunter who has possessed this hawk vol
make<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> come<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.360> life<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.710> really

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
make it come to life and it's really

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.280 
make it come to life and it's really
interesting<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> because

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
interesting to think about that because

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.569 
interesting to think about that because
those<00:01:49.290> two<00:01:49.500> towns<00:01:49.710> aren't<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.220> far<00:01:50.460> apart

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
those two towns aren't too far apart

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.710 
those two towns aren't too far apart
when<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.240> about<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.600> see

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
when you think about what you see

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440 
when you think about what you see
Voltorb<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.619> original<00:01:52.920> game<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.610> red

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
Kara Butterfree comes from Caterpie now

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
Kara Butterfree comes from Caterpie now
these<00:02:34.890> two<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> look<00:02:35.610> at<00:02:35.700> their<00:02:35.820> eyes

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
these two if you look at their eyes

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940 
these two if you look at their eyes
their<00:02:36.390> hands<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> their<00:02:37.020> little<00:02:37.170> feet<00:02:37.440> they

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
their hands and their little feet they

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.280 
their hands and their little feet they
look<00:02:38.100> almost<00:02:38.310> identical<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.540> there's<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
look almost identical and there's a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.450 
look almost identical and there's a
nibble<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> better<00:02:40.860> picture<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.280> show

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
nibble it's a better picture my show

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.120 
nibble it's a better picture my show
just<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.150> second<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.630> these<00:02:43.130> makes

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
just in just a second but these makes

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.830 
just in just a second but these makes
sense<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.850> they<00:02:45.090> came<00:02:45.300> from<00:02:45.360> each<00:02:45.630> other

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
sense that they came from each other

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.330 
sense that they came from each other
rather<00:02:46.080> than<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.500> other<00:02:46.650> opposite

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
rather than the other opposite

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.770 
rather than the other opposite
evolutions<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.170> especially<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.620> at

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
evolutions and especially if you look at

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.560 
evolutions and especially if you look at
Metapod<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.400> venomoth<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.940> you'll<00:02:54.360> see<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
Metapod and venomoth here you'll see the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.390 
Metapod and venomoth here you'll see the
similarities<00:02:55.110> are<00:02:55.140> even<00:02:55.590> closer<00:02:56.040> they<00:02:56.250> both

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
similarities are even closer they both

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.190 
similarities are even closer they both
up<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> spikey<00:02:57.030> paws<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:57.600> top<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.900> their<00:02:57.990> head

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
up the spikey paws on top of their head

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.980 
up the spikey paws on top of their head
and<00:02:58.910> they<00:02:59.910> just<00:02:59.970> look<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.450> they<00:03:00.690> go<00:03:00.780> together

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
and they just look like they go together

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.080 
and they just look like they go together
better<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:02.340> way<00:03:02.520> than<00:03:02.700> they<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
better in this way than they do in the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.310 
better in this way than they do in the
original<00:03:03.150> game<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.630> there's<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> very<00:03:03.960> good

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
original game and there's a very good

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.690 
original game and there's a very good
theory<00:03:04.530> behind<00:03:04.710> this

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
theory behind this

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.490 
theory behind this
it<00:03:05.910> started<00:03:06.240> off<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.690> theory<00:03:07.020> that<00:03:07.140> there<00:03:07.380> was

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it started off the theory that there was

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
it started off the theory that there was
the<00:03:07.680> game<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:08.070> these<00:03:08.190> rulers<00:03:08.730> originally

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the game with these rulers originally

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.230 
the game with these rulers originally
switched<00:03:10.470> well<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.640> before<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> game<00:03:12.120> was

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
switched well just before the game was

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.190 
switched well just before the game was
released

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
released

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.380 
released
basically<00:03:13.740> because<00:03:13.970> Ashton<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.300> the
