00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.370
 Yup 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.049
 today we are to see the collection of a 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.140
 product that few people know is the 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.770
 buckwheat we are in garfagnana in 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 municipality of piazza al serchio and we are 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.440
 come to see the proper harvest of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 this is not fair because it is a fief 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.680
 ge real as 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.830
 does not belong to the family of 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.700
 grasses but to the family of the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.350
 policies 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:48.850
 therefore it is a called wheat but in reality 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.720
 its scientific name is different 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.369
 please pirme exclusendum and do it to ri 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.740
 boom means derives from the vague Latin 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 how do I do it because the arcana 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.650
 seeds of this pseudo cereal 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.040
 they look a lot like the seeds of the face are 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.000
 smaller triangular brown seeds but 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.730
 they do not resemble, for example, wheat 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 this is where this pseudo-cereal comes from 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.270
 comes from far away comes from the Himalayas 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.540
 it is even grown normally 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.140
 in the high areas also mountainous areas 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.810
 freddy to a cultivation cycle that goes 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.800
 then from 80 to 120 days 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.460
 1 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.470
 annual and legislative product well 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.910
 also where it comes from right tight 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.720
 especially in the high mountains and in 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.020
 garfagnana 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.690
 among other things, today we can say that we are 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.020
 the largest producers throughout Italy 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.960
 how strange among people is produced 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.240
 also in umbria it is produced in pa 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.660
 Italy as the South Tyrol is the piedmont 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.380
 but he knows here for some years really if 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.070
 it is producing a lot like it 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.870
 party started from a project 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.090
 of the university of florence that different 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.060
 years ago he did research in 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.070
 always garfagnana up in others she was anxious 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.260
 in the municipality of piazza al serchio and ha 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.390
 found of the old two old e 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.240
 ancient varieties of this grenade 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.730
 generate buckwheat one is the child e 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.520
 the other is there she has in this case 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.430
 this field has been scattered there today 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.060
 she has one of these two varieties then in 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 the other fields are also finished 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.300
 for food use what can be done 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.520
 it is very important first of all why 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.239
 rich in vitamins rich in 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.830
 potassium 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:02.250
 so it's in the most important diet 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:05.489
 especially in celiac ceri ag then 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:09.000
 we're going to see how we can 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.459
 turn into blog dishes for this 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.420
 kind of disease we all know by now 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.489
 the tradition that exists in valtellina 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.019
 especially on polenta taragna sui 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.200
 here pizzoccheri are derived dishes 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.970
 just from buckwheat 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.130
 but as a relief in food use 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.400
 especially with regards to 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.250
 gluten intolerant of sufferers 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.310
 of celiac disease 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.910
 this is an exceptional product 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.729
 so we'll see this later 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.750
 going to see how it can transform 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.990
 on the menu just for celiacs but as I have 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.840
 said you can do it from the windows and 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.919
 vegetables can be transformed above all 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.620
 in flour to make polenta to make 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.760
 cookies can be made crepes you 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.910
 can make pasta 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.990
 it can be turned into many 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.410
 so many ways 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.310
 another property of this one of this 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.830
 plant is that it comes even if undermined by 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.280
 part of beekeepers in certain areas 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.950
 because at its long flowering and it is 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.020
 very much sought after by the world 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.570
 therefore there are areas 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.940
 especially also in the high Adige where 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.470
 they sow these small little fields 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.030
 plots just to make honey 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.190
 a lot of honey comes from the bees 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.520
 particular and very good 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:48.220
 as you can see this the plant has some 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.800
 particularity of course to grow 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.340
 well in the mountains as it does not have 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.370
 need a lot of water so it bears 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.670
 well the drought also the able-bodied like 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.930
 see flowers I repeat are the eyes but it is 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.180
 also another peculiarity that 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.090
 consider nitrogen fixable ie from 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.730
 this cultivation then releases to his 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.650
 of nitrogen inside the soil 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.750
 so next year we can 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.400
 intervene with other cultures such as the 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.210
 potato etc. 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.780
 here you see the little plant like 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.400
 it grows and is now harvested by martin 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.350
 harris 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.650
 we will then continue to talk about 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.560
 buckwheat in another episode 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:39.060
 going to a restaurant to see how 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.250
 we cook all this product 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.900
 especially with regards to the 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.420
 celiac disease for intolerant al 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:51.060
 gluten because today it is very important 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.060
 this pseudo-cereal to meet again
