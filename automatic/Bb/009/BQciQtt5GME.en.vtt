a spring in it oh it does so it'll snap
back<00:02:43.770> into<00:02:43.800> place<00:02:44.360> today<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.580> fossil

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
back into place today here two fossil

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.940 
back into place today here two fossil
bones<00:02:47.850> what<00:02:48.450> what<00:02:48.870> let's<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.530> ahead<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> put

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
bones what what let's go ahead and put

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620 
bones what what let's go ahead and put
these<00:02:50.040> together<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.730> doesn't<00:02:51.060> say<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.420> kind

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
of fossil it is on the box so I'm just

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.070 
of fossil it is on the box so I'm just
gonna<00:02:53.880> cut<00:02:54.150> these<00:02:54.269> out<00:02:54.420> instead<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.840> trying<00:02:55.049> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
gonna cut these out instead of trying to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.390 
gonna cut these out instead of trying to
twist<00:02:55.320> them<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.590> yeah<00:02:57.830> it's<00:02:58.830> gonna<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.250> a

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
puzzle I think well they even put a

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.840 
puzzle I think well they even put a
trilobite<00:03:01.980> right<00:03:02.430> here

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
trilobite right here

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:12.380 
trilobite right here
how<00:03:03.030> very<00:03:03.330> authentic<00:03:04.170> fossil<00:03:04.739> II<00:03:10.430> oh<00:03:11.430> cool

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
together I will let you look at what

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.120 
together I will let you look at what
he's<00:03:16.440> doing<00:03:16.680> over<00:03:17.040> here

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.590 

little<00:03:23.130> dude<00:03:23.280> thinks<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.610> fossil<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> t-rex

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
little dude thinks the fossil is a t-rex

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.330 
little dude thinks the fossil is a t-rex
super<00:03:25.020> fragile<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.740> for<00:03:25.920> playing<00:03:26.130> with

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
super fragile it's not for playing with

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.470 
super fragile it's not for playing with
once<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.670> get<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.880> put<00:03:27.030> together<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.390> think

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
once you get it put together I think

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210 
once you get it put together I think
it's<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:27.900> for<00:03:28.020> decoration<00:03:28.080> or<00:03:28.950> for

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
it's just for decoration or for

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.250 
it's just for decoration or for
atmosphere<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.540> don't<00:03:30.720> even<00:03:30.930> know<00:03:31.050> if<00:03:31.140> he

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
atmosphere so I don't even know if he

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.020 
atmosphere so I don't even know if he
stands<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.800> there<00:03:32.070> he<00:03:32.160> goes<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.820> that's

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
stands up there he goes so that's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.700 
stands up there he goes so that's
probably<00:03:33.270> a<00:03:33.450> t-rex<00:03:33.780> judging<00:03:34.200> by<00:03:34.290> his<00:03:34.470> short

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
probably a t-rex judging by his short

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.130 
probably a t-rex judging by his short
little<00:03:34.860> legs<00:03:35.160> there's<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.240> helicopter<00:03:36.540> or
