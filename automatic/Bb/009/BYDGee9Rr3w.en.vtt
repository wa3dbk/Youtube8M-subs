00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 I later follow the return in one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.720
 sold out Olympia stadium in wijchen 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.800
 broadcasts 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.300
 and now further that only travel for 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.310
 he who I have the chance to return 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.310
 because the ball yes too hard ago 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.090
 He has been awarded drying times 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.670
 scored by a huge one 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.800
 German coverage error a goal of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.239
 empress the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.540
 near the tenth minute and old 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.540
 case 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.420
 who looks at it beautifully for that 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.070
 is wrong 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 and we are not yet at the tenth minute 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.989
 how it was the seventh minute 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.210
 Piet Emperor who stuck there beautifully 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.250
 rather a great one 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.739
 wrong picking toy from one of the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 defenders and those in the big ones 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.899
 excitement in this mighty stadium 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.990
 head cool and the group purely focused 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.990
 and ajax on 108 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.830
 focus on the poem by speyer 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.830
 and his and it's already there 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.230
 the ball from the corner by one or 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.380
 response was missed and by 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.690
 now buy again 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.290
 Now I see repetition camera 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.290
 behind the goal 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 poodle that has purchased 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.280
 And now you will have some room for the Germans 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.630
 four defenders was viral 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.940
 will that gets the ball I thought 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.760
 offside position, no matter what , he scores 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 and what does the referee do? 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.830
 the referee knows the goal to me 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.869
 I thought it was offside thought 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.390
 offside but here you can see the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.280
 Holling dunes and those mr all 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.009
 meter later I thought the ball 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.140
 played and dance yoga not only he 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.479
 looks on leave to continue and works 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.479
 it is down to pick the job as 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.390
 that must be said well that they are in the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.610
 responses from the by and supporters 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.540
 it is the 37th minute of the first half 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.400
 this way in your image is unyielding 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.769
 equal the rock of gibraltar 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.880
 This English country says it is 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.880
 solid 2 1 start 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.670
 you disagree 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.920
 older news looking down continues 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.920
 two one and ajax are allowed in the hall
