00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.960 
mechanic
jumping<00:03:02.410> between<00:03:02.710> collisions<00:03:03.190> touch<00:03:03.670> and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
jumping between collisions touch and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.570 
jumping between collisions touch and
each<00:03:04.360> puzzle<00:03:04.660> is<00:03:04.990> unique<00:03:05.350> in<00:03:05.650> every<00:03:05.830> level<00:03:06.370> I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
each puzzle is unique in every level I

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.180 
each puzzle is unique in every level I
like<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.240> fact<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.630> right<00:03:08.080> now<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.920> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
like the fact that right now I have to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.880 
like the fact that right now I have to
actually<00:03:09.370> avoid<00:03:10.240> this<00:03:10.480> lava<00:03:10.840> well<00:03:11.320> that's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
actually avoid this lava well that's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.250 
actually avoid this lava well that's
filling<00:03:12.370> up<00:03:12.520> all<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.910> suddenly<00:03:13.270> because<00:03:13.810> of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
filling up all of a suddenly because of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.100 
filling up all of a suddenly because of
that<00:03:14.590> monster<00:03:15.220> up<00:03:15.370> top<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.870> way<00:03:17.080> I

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
that monster up top but the way I

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.860 
that monster up top but the way I
actually<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:17.800> to<00:03:18.070> be<00:03:18.400> creative<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:19.180> how<00:03:19.270> i

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
actually have to be creative on how i

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.440 
actually have to be creative on how i
get<00:03:20.260> from<00:03:20.470> one<00:03:20.710> point<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.310> other<00:03:21.610> as<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
get from one point to the other as you

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.690 
get from one point to the other as you
can<00:03:22.570> see<00:03:22.930> i<00:03:23.230> get<00:03:23.500> really<00:03:23.680> creative<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.400> it's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
can see i get really creative and it's

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.030 
can see i get really creative and it's
very<00:03:25.150> very<00:03:25.270> fresh<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.440> unique<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.010> think

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
very very fresh and unique I think

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.620 
very very fresh and unique I think
recently<00:03:27.820> with<00:03:28.600> how<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.170> was<00:03:29.380> executed<00:03:30.130> now

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
recently with how this was executed now

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.450 
recently with how this was executed now
the<00:03:31.630> gameplay<00:03:32.020> is<00:03:32.170> good<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.710> story's<00:03:33.040> good<00:03:33.220> so

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
the gameplay is good the story's good so

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.070 
the gameplay is good the story's good so
far<00:03:33.730> there's<00:03:34.030> only<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.450> much<00:03:34.600> I<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.780> talk
