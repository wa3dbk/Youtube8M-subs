00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.200
 let's try the niche market topic 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 and micro niche markets too 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 we'll see the definition of keyword or 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.590
 keyword types of keywords 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.920
 of keywords according to your intention of 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.650
 purchase 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.540
 what is a market is a group of 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.279
 larger and easier people 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.260
 identification that they have 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.000
 problems or needs and they are 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.280
 investigating on the internet the way how 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.630
 solve them there are three mega 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.640
 market trends that are 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.400
 highly profitable these are money 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.920
 love and health of the entire market focused 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.129
 in the money we have for example sales 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.949
 marketing advertising business service 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.780
 the customer and everything related to 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.360
 the way how to make money both in 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.160
 internet as outside the internet 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.370
 then we have the market focused on the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 love as we see here phrases like babies 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.070
 children wanted friendship teenagers 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.900
 dating romance divorce marriages is 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 say everything related to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.979
 affective or sentimental part of the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.780
 people and also to their tastes or 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.250
 hobbies 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 in the market focused on health 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.340
 we find for example phrases like 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.259
 lose weight gain weight 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.970
 bodybuilding skin care 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.799
 etcetera and all those subjects 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.299
 related to both physical health and 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.299
 to mental health of people 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 it's already a niche market it 's a subgroup 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.900
 of a market is a group of people 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.430
 with specific problems and needs 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.680
 for example if our market is sales 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.400
 online a fact would be online sales of 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.380
 perfumes 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.090
 now we move on to the topic of micro niche 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.210
 the micro niches are segments 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.190
 particular niche markets are very 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.620
 specific and by concentrating on them 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.440
 it is possible to position ourselves in the short term 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.960
 for example if our market is sales 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.450
 online a niche would be online sales of 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 perfumes and a micron fact would be sales 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.360
 online perfume European words 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.700
 key that makes a keyword is a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.070
 phrase with its own meaning is not just a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.200
 singular word we can define from the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.670
 next way word or phrase that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.980
 someone writes in the engines of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.500
 search when they are looking for something 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.390
 example when someone writes in google 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.380
 selling people online this is a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.240
 keyword 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.190
 keyword types according to their 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.040
 extension we have two types words 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.960
 short keys or generic keyword 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.300
 this is a one or two keyword 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.130
 words and with which you can not 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.230
 determine exactly what 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.210
 they are really looking for the users 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.600
 for example when someone writes in 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.150
 google dogs love seduce earning money 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.460
 lose weight etcetera are not noticing 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.330
 clearly that is the infor that is the 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.430
 information that really needs them 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.770
 long tail keywords figure 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.320
 specific or denominated in English 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.390
 also long time word 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.580
 this is a keyword of three or more 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.010
 words with which you can determine 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.420
 what they are really looking for 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 users for example when someone 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.580
 write in google educate a dog 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.140

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.250
 money online start a business 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.080
 on the internet they are clearly noticing 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.270
 who are looking for specific information and 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.450
 we 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.900
 time to do a word study 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.230
 key we will also be able to identify 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.460
 the product or service that the person 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.460
 is in need 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.110
 my intention is to buy a word 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.670
 Key not have all keywords 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.290
 the same value as regards 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.209
 amount of traffic and as soon as 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.970
 refers to generating sales or 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.100
 conversions the purchase intention of 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.020
 a keyword can determine the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.239
 success or failure of strategies 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.160
 web positioning and you need to know 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.230
 know them to give them higher priority 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.600
 when selecting for 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.310
 now searchers position 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.170
 we have a clear example of two words 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.520
 key one of them does not intend to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.620
 purchase and the other if you intend to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.170
 buy for example sell online 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.510
 free versus how to sell for 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.980
 internet which of these keywords 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.620
 have better intention to buy by 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.790
 course the second keyword has 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.680
 better purchase intention than the first 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.110
 keyword types by your intention 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.730
 purchase to help you find the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.620
 best keywords by intention of 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.170
 purchase let's differentiate searches 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.570
 of three types the first one we have 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.880
 keywords by author in this type of 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.320
 searches is shown that the user 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.450
 who performs these searches has a 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.520
 high purchase intention at that time 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.710
 in the near future because you already have a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.110
 reference about the author who is 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.900
 looking for example when someone 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.870
 write in google poor rich poor father 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.880
 from robert kiyosaki that person already has 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.550
 an approach or at least has a 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.320
 author's reference as well as his 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.260
 book and therefore is looking for the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.620
 how to acquire or how to get 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.470
 this book 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.090
 the other way of recognizing a word 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.250
 key for your purchase intention is to 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.260
 through the specific product ie 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.400
 like the previous case the 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.410
 people who perform this type of 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.210
 searches are intended to acquire 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.360
 this product and they look for the information 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.310
 that reinforces or consolidates its decision to 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.630
 through reviews recommendations or 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.120
 comments from other people who 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.580
 they bought the product if the term 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.320
 it is also accompanied by terms like 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.110
 buy or then acquire the investment 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.840
 of purchase increases considerably in 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.930
 this in these two examples we have two 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.160
 keywords with purchase intention 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.340
 when a user writes for example 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.900
 samsung digital camera and where to buy 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.990
 samsung digital camera are 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.740
 evidencing clearly his intention of 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.889
 purchase 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.990
 the other way of being able to live or better 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.419
 said identify the keywords with 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.789
 Purchase intention is through the 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.110
 indicators of emotional crisis this 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:04.460
 type of searches usually the 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.340
 do people with a problem 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.319
 persistent and that has them disturbed 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.930
 emotionally either a divorce 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.580
 loving disillusionment deceptions fear etc and 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.470
 therefore he has a high intention of 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.840
 purchase if they find a product that 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.520
 help solve your problem by 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.520
 example how to recover my partner 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.870

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.970

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.979
 key with purchase intention which 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.220
 you can use to arm 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.800
 your keywords and may be more 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.150
 effective when generating traffic 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.400
 to your website 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.830
 this part is important and I have taken it 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.240
 in consideration since the 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.150
 web positioning has to bring 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.700
