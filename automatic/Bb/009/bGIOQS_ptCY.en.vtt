Shang Dynasty in China there are over
2,300<00:02:00.450> years<00:02:00.659> old<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> Butterfield<00:02:04.259> had<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
2,300 years old so Butterfield had a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
2,300 years old so Butterfield had a
problem<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.040> solve<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.850> she<00:02:06.149> wanted<00:02:06.390> her<00:02:06.540> art

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
problem to solve if she wanted her art

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.949 
problem to solve if she wanted her art
to<00:02:07.140> last<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:08.670> bit<00:02:08.819> longer<00:02:08.940> than<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to last a little bit longer than just a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.290 
to last a little bit longer than just a
couple<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.319> years<00:02:10.679> she<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
couple of years she was going to have to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
couple of years she was going to have to
learn<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.660> use<00:02:12.690> new<00:02:12.840> materials

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
learn to use new materials

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.690 
learn to use new materials
and<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.150> how<00:02:16.040> some<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.220> these<00:02:17.370> horses

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and so that's how some of these horses

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.330 
and so that's how some of these horses
made<00:02:18.150> from<00:02:18.510> industrial<00:02:19.350> scrap<00:02:19.710> welded

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
made from industrial scrap welded

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.420 
made from industrial scrap welded
together<00:02:20.520> came<00:02:21.180> about<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> Joseph<00:02:26.220> he

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
together came about this is Joseph he

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.930 
together came about this is Joseph he
was<00:02:26.580> made<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.910> 1988<00:02:27.680> also<00:02:28.680> from<00:02:28.980> recycled

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
was made in 1988 also from recycled

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.930 
was made in 1988 also from recycled
industrial<00:02:30.690> steel<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.200> love<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.370> colors<00:02:32.730> that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
industrial steel I love the colors that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.340 
industrial steel I love the colors that
Butterfield<00:02:33.810> chose<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.590> Joseph<00:02:36.260> do<00:02:37.260> you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
Butterfield chose for Joseph do you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.430 
Butterfield chose for Joseph do you
think<00:02:37.590> Butterfield<00:02:38.100> has<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.850> bigger<00:02:39.330> idea<00:02:39.959> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
think Butterfield has a bigger idea that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.680 
think Butterfield has a bigger idea that
she<00:02:40.620> wanted<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.920> communicate<00:02:41.390> besides<00:02:42.390> just

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
