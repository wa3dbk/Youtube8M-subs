00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and basically you'll notice that when we

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.880 
and basically you'll notice that when we
color<00:00:21.690> correct<00:00:21.990> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.230> these<00:00:22.560> artistic

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
color correct kind of these artistic

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.100 
color correct kind of these artistic
shots<00:00:23.250> these<00:00:23.430> mood<00:00:23.700> shots<00:00:23.940> we<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.780> lot

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
shots these mood shots we have a lot

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.630 
shots these mood shots we have a lot
more<00:00:25.290> artistic<00:00:25.800> leeway<00:00:26.190> and<00:00:26.310> there's<00:00:26.460> not

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
more artistic leeway and there's not

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160 
more artistic leeway and there's not
really<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.940> right<00:00:27.270> and<00:00:27.450> wrong<00:00:27.510> way<00:00:27.870> I<00:00:27.900> mean

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
really a right and wrong way I mean

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
really a right and wrong way I mean
there's<00:00:28.320> probably<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> wrong<00:00:29.280> way<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:29.700> there's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
there's probably a wrong way but there's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
there's probably a wrong way but there's
many<00:00:30.180> many<00:00:30.360> right<00:00:30.720> ways<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:31.200> so<00:00:31.770> i'm<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
many many right ways and so i'm going to

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380 
many many right ways and so i'm going to
show<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.129> guys<00:00:32.309> exactly<00:00:32.460> how<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.059> work<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
show you guys exactly how they work and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
show you guys exactly how they work and
a<00:00:33.780> lot<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> images<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.039> and<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a lot of the images in this and this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.060 
a lot of the images in this and this
exercise<00:00:36.180> file<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> catalog<00:00:37.260> actually

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
exercise file and the catalog actually

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.290 
exercise file and the catalog actually
probably<00:00:38.250> fit<00:00:38.640> under<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.000> artistic

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
probably fit under this artistic

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.120 
probably fit under this artistic
category<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.200> we've<00:00:40.320> only<00:00:40.380> put<00:00:40.650> three<00:00:41.040> in

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
category but we've only put three in

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.260 
category but we've only put three in
there<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.700> reworking<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
there just so we're not reworking the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
there just so we're not reworking the
same<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.810> over<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.140> over<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:44.160> let's

different temperatures going to work for

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.850 
different temperatures going to work for
this<00:01:06.090> i<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.750> leave<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.079> exactly<00:01:07.409> where<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.829> is

and then even do a little detail brush
over<00:01:18.329> i'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.899> detail<00:01:19.229> brush

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
over i'm going to use the detail brush

over i'm going to use the detail brush
from<00:01:19.530> our<00:01:19.679> last<00:01:19.920> tutorial<00:01:20.459> where<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:20.969> have<00:01:21.149> a

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
from our last tutorial where we have a

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.449 
from our last tutorial where we have a
little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.259> contrast<00:01:22.770> i'll<00:01:23.009> increase<00:01:23.249> my

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
little bit of contrast i'll increase my

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:24.980 
little bit of contrast i'll increase my
contrast<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.969> bit<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.179> little<00:01:24.329> bit<00:01:24.539> clarity<00:01:24.929> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
contrast a bit a little bit clarity a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.050 
contrast a bit a little bit clarity a
little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.289> of<00:01:25.350> sharpness<00:01:25.670> run<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.789> over<00:01:26.819> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
little bit of sharpness run it over the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
little bit of sharpness run it over the
entire<00:01:27.270> image<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:28.130> that's<00:01:29.130> great<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.579> could

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
entire image and that's great it could

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
entire image and that's great it could
be<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.270> could<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.569> one<00:01:30.810> version<00:01:31.139> of<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
be this could be one version of the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
be this could be one version of the
image<00:01:31.289> right<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.939> another<00:01:32.939> version<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
image right there another version the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.029 
image right there another version the
image<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.539> could<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.749> a<00:01:33.779> very<00:01:33.869> cold<00:01:34.380> version<00:01:34.799> so

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
image we could do a very cold version so

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.879 
image we could do a very cold version so
where<00:01:35.219> we<00:01:35.340> kind<00:01:35.609> of<00:01:35.729> leave<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.029> more<00:01:36.329> blue<00:01:36.889> and

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
where we kind of leave it more blue and

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.620 
where we kind of leave it more blue and
you'll<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.219> that<00:01:38.249> this<00:01:38.819> is<00:01:38.999> why<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.149> call<00:01:39.479> these

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you'll see that this is why i call these

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.809 
you'll see that this is why i call these
kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> mood<00:01:40.109> shots<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.700> typically<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
kind of mood shots because typically a

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.279 
kind of mood shots because typically a
mood<00:01:42.060> shot<00:01:42.329> kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.719> has<00:01:42.929> more<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.920> uniform

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
mood shot kind of has more of a uniform

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.870 
mood shot kind of has more of a uniform
kind<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.469> color<00:01:47.219> grade<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.609> it<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.849> you're

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
kind of a color grade to it like you're

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.129 
kind of a color grade to it like you're
kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.209> going<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.569> certain<00:01:48.869> color

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
kind of going with a certain color

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:50.809 
kind of going with a certain color
scheme<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.529> each<00:01:49.649> image<00:01:49.859> and<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.639> there's

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
scheme in each image and so there's

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.459 
scheme in each image and so there's
usually<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.329> couple<00:01:51.630> different<00:01:52.049> color

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
usually only a couple different color

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.649 
usually only a couple different color
tones<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.249> in<00:01:53.609> one<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.789> these<00:01:53.880> mood<00:01:54.119> shots<00:01:54.419> and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
tones in in one of these mood shots and

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.019 
tones in in one of these mood shots and
so<00:01:54.810> they're<00:01:55.590> very<00:01:55.619> flexible<00:01:56.459> as<00:01:56.549> far<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.849> kind

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
so they're very flexible as far as kind

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:58.969 
so they're very flexible as far as kind
of<00:01:57.439> manipulating<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.709> kind<00:01:58.859> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
of manipulating them and kind of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
of manipulating them and kind of
changing<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.549> artistic<00:01:59.789> style<00:02:00.209> so

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
changing them to your artistic style so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.959 
changing them to your artistic style so
let's<00:02:01.409> save<00:02:01.829> one<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.130> these<00:02:02.249> snapshots<00:02:02.520> we'll

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
let's save one of these snapshots we'll

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.969 
let's save one of these snapshots we'll
go<00:02:03.739> we'll<00:02:04.739> go<00:02:05.299> same<00:02:06.299> move<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.569> shot<00:02:06.779> blue

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
go we'll go same move a shot blue

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.130 
go we'll go same move a shot blue
and<00:02:09.159> then<00:02:09.759> let's<00:02:09.909> do<00:02:10.090> one<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.659> will<00:02:10.869> call

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and then let's do one that will call

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.960 
and then let's do one that will call
technically<00:02:11.830> as<00:02:11.980> color<00:02:12.220> correct<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:12.879> we're

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
technically as color correct so we're

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.119 
technically as color correct so we're
just<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.239> go<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> shot<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.230> we'll<00:02:14.920> call

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
just going to go a shot and we'll call

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.320 
just going to go a shot and we'll call
this<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:15.549> color<00:02:15.790> correct<00:02:17.730> color<00:02:18.730> corrected

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
this one color correct color corrected

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.170 
this one color correct color corrected
and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.769> can<00:02:20.890> also<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> super<00:02:21.970> warm

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and then we can also do a super warm

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.910 
and then we can also do a super warm
shot<00:02:22.450> 2<00:02:22.690> by<00:02:22.720> just<00:02:23.080> pumping<00:02:23.470> up<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
shot 2 by just pumping up the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
shot 2 by just pumping up the
temperature<00:02:24.159> even<00:02:24.370> more<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.480> get<00:02:25.660> this

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
temperature even more and we get this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.839 
temperature even more and we get this
like<00:02:25.989> really<00:02:26.290> golden<00:02:26.799> feel<00:02:27.040> from<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.340> there's

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
like really golden feel from it there's

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.360 
like really golden feel from it there's
not<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.360> any<00:02:28.629> wrong<00:02:29.290> way<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> do<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.010> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
not really any wrong way to do this so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
not really any wrong way to do this so
that's<00:02:31.000> kind<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.330> point<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.780> these<00:02:32.349> mug

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that's kind of the point of these mug

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.380 
that's kind of the point of these mug
shots<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.069> let's<00:02:33.250> go<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.640> add<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.060> we're

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
shots so let's go and add this one we're

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.940 
shots so let's go and add this one we're
going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.540> call<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.280> moved<00:02:36.280> shot<00:02:36.640> gold<00:02:37.950> alright

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
going to call it moved shot gold alright

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.920 
going to call it moved shot gold alright
let's<00:02:39.099> go<00:02:39.159> to<00:02:39.250> our<00:02:39.310> next<00:02:39.430> image<00:02:39.720> same<00:02:40.720> thing

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
let's go to our next image same thing

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.630 
let's go to our next image same thing
with<00:02:41.019> this<00:02:41.200> we<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.680> kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> an<00:02:42.160> underlying

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
with this we have kind of an underlying

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.660 
with this we have kind of an underlying
theme<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.390> color<00:02:43.599> tone<00:02:43.840> which<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.140> blue<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
theme to the color tone which is blue so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.280 
theme to the color tone which is blue so
I'm<00:02:45.879> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> kind<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.450> increase<00:02:46.780> my<00:02:46.930> blacks

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
I'm going to kind of increase my blacks

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.319 
I'm going to kind of increase my blacks
increase<00:02:47.799> my<00:02:47.920> contrast<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.519> little<00:02:48.700> bit<00:02:48.879> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
increase my contrast a little bit and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.270 
increase my contrast a little bit and
now<00:02:49.690> i<00:02:49.720> can<00:02:50.019> either<00:02:50.260> i<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.799> i<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:50.980> kind<00:02:51.250> of

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
now i can either i can i can kind of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.430 
now i can either i can i can kind of
bring<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.489> down<00:02:51.879> into<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> more<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> blues

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
bring it down into the more of the blues

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
bring it down into the more of the blues
and<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.739> doesn't<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.310> my<00:02:54.670> kind<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.239> mind<00:02:55.420> it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and it doesn't in my kind of mind it

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.819 
and it doesn't in my kind of mind it
doesn't<00:02:55.690> look<00:02:55.840> as<00:02:56.019> good<00:02:56.049> in<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.620> blue

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
doesn't look as good in the in the blue

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.930 
doesn't look as good in the in the blue
area<00:02:57.010> but<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.540> works<00:02:58.959> great<00:02:59.260> as<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.760> app

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
area but it works great as like app

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.900 
area but it works great as like app
basically<00:03:01.329> under<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:02.019> shot<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.129> this<00:03:03.340> is<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.489> shot

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
basically under a shot so this is a shot

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.910 
basically under a shot so this is a shot
it<00:03:04.359> works<00:03:04.629> great<00:03:04.780> right<00:03:05.049> there<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.410> also<00:03:05.739> works

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
it works great right there it also works

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.339 
it works great right there it also works
very<00:03:06.069> very<00:03:06.340> well<00:03:06.579> as<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.000> very<00:03:07.450> warm<00:03:07.780> image<00:03:08.109> so

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
very very well as a very warm image so

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.619 
very very well as a very warm image so
kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.620> pumping<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.129> getting<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.209> kind<00:03:10.569> of

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
kind of pumping it up getting a kind of

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.780 
kind of pumping it up getting a kind of
those<00:03:10.720> Purple's<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.950> end<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.579> hood

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
those Purple's into the end of the hood

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.670 
those Purple's into the end of the hood
it<00:03:13.450> looks<00:03:13.630> really<00:03:13.900> beautiful<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.319> guess<00:03:14.470> too<00:03:14.650> so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
it looks really beautiful I guess too so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
it looks really beautiful I guess too so
we'll<00:03:15.459> create<00:03:15.730> two<00:03:16.000> versions<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.389> this<00:03:16.510> image

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
we'll create two versions of this image

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.270 
we'll create two versions of this image
so<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.889> first<00:03:18.160> one<00:03:18.370> let's<00:03:18.760> go<00:03:19.359> back<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:20.280> let's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
so the first one let's go back to let's

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.640 
so the first one let's go back to let's
go<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.489> shop<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.359> let's<00:03:23.079> warm<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.349> up<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
go to a shop and let's warm it up just a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.530 
go to a shop and let's warm it up just a
tiny<00:03:23.859> bit<00:03:24.010> and<00:03:24.400> we'll<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.269> add<00:03:25.419> a<00:03:25.450> little

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
tiny bit and we'll just add a little

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.589 
tiny bit and we'll just add a little
more<00:03:25.780> clarity<00:03:26.079> vibrance<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:28.389> think

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
more clarity vibrance and I think

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.120 
more clarity vibrance and I think
sharpers<00:03:29.079> everything<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.500> probably<00:03:29.650> fine<00:03:29.829> on

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
sharpers everything is probably fine on

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.460 
sharpers everything is probably fine on
this<00:03:30.299> that's<00:03:31.299> good<00:03:31.540> right<00:03:31.720> there<00:03:31.900> was<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.440> a

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this that's good right there was that a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.750 
this that's good right there was that a
little<00:03:32.709> bit<00:03:32.769> more<00:03:32.950> recovered<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.579> kind<00:03:33.730> of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
little bit more recovered to kind of

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520 
little bit more recovered to kind of
pull<00:03:33.970> down<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.269> highlights<00:03:34.900> on<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.079> sky<00:03:35.260> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
pull down the highlights on the sky and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.730 
pull down the highlights on the sky and
we'll<00:03:36.250> call<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.700> one<00:03:36.940> color<00:03:37.480> corrected

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.370 

and<00:03:41.300> then<00:03:42.300> let's<00:03:42.480> create<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> mood<00:03:43.140> shot

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
and then let's create the mood shot

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.420 
and then let's create the mood shot
version<00:03:43.710> of<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:43.890> which<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
version of it which is going to be a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.190 
version of it which is going to be a
very<00:03:44.520> very<00:03:44.940> warm<00:03:45.150> version<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> same<00:03:45.930> shot

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
very very warm version of the same shot

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
very very warm version of the same shot
so<00:03:47.040> we're<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.160> going<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> warm<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.790> up

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
so we're just going to warm it up

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.720 
so we're just going to warm it up
probably<00:03:48.570> do<00:03:48.630> about<00:03:48.720> right<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.580> i'm<00:03:50.580> going

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
probably do about right there i'm going

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.220 
probably do about right there i'm going
to<00:03:50.790> call<00:03:50.880> mood<00:03:51.510> shot<00:03:52.230> warm<00:03:53.900> all<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:55.050> let's

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
to call mood shot warm all right let's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.350 
to call mood shot warm all right let's
go<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.470> next<00:03:55.620> image<00:03:55.920> again<00:03:56.790> same<00:03:57.060> thing<00:03:57.300> we

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
go to the next image again same thing we

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.630 
go to the next image again same thing we
kind<00:03:57.540> of<00:03:57.570> have<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:58.050> underlying<00:03:58.620> yellow<00:03:59.370> color

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
kind of have an underlying yellow color

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.000 
kind of have an underlying yellow color
theme<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.030> this<00:04:00.120> image<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:01.080> we're<00:04:01.830> going<00:04:01.890> to

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
theme to this image so we're going to

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.130 
theme to this image so we're going to
darken<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.520> up<00:04:02.640> first<00:04:03.210> add<00:04:03.660> my<00:04:03.990> blacks<00:04:04.380> back<00:04:04.680> in

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
darken it up first add my blacks back in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.770 
darken it up first add my blacks back in
add<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> little<00:04:07.350> bit<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.530> contrast<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.630> then<00:04:09.630> do

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
add a little bit of contrast and then do

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.240 
add a little bit of contrast and then do
a<00:04:09.810> little<00:04:09.990> bit<00:04:10.110> recovery<00:04:10.380> just<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.010> kind<00:04:11.220> of

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
a little bit recovery just to kind of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.210 
a little bit recovery just to kind of
bring<00:04:11.850> back<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.770> highlights<00:04:13.770> on<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.950> skin

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
bring back the highlights on the skin

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.760 
bring back the highlights on the skin
tones<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.030> let's<00:04:15.660> see<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.020> this<00:04:16.110> is<00:04:16.170> a<00:04:16.290> shot

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
tones and let's see it so this is a shot

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.680 
tones and let's see it so this is a shot
so<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.220> works<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:17.760> where<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.330> will<00:04:18.480> create

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
so it works there where it will create

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.060 
so it works there where it will create
this<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.080> our<00:04:19.170> color<00:04:19.470> correct<00:04:19.770> i'm<00:04:19.890> going<00:04:20.010> to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
this as our color correct i'm going to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.560 
this as our color correct i'm going to
add<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.400> clarity<00:04:20.760> before<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:21.420> do

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
add a little bit clarity before we do

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.570 
add a little bit clarity before we do
that<00:04:21.600> yeah<00:04:22.170> just<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.500> tiny<00:04:22.710> bit<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:23.010> clarity<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
that yeah just a tiny bit of clarity and

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.900 
that yeah just a tiny bit of clarity and
a<00:04:24.480> little<00:04:24.720> bit<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.840> vibrance<00:04:25.260> as<00:04:25.410> well<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.910> I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
a little bit of vibrance as well and I

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.160 
a little bit of vibrance as well and I
think<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.270> image<00:04:27.780> could<00:04:27.900> actually<00:04:28.020> use

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
think this image could actually use

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.510 
think this image could actually use
quite<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.470> bit<00:04:28.530> sharpening<00:04:28.920> let's<00:04:29.130> sharpen<00:04:29.340> go

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
quite a bit sharpening let's sharpen go

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.210 
quite a bit sharpening let's sharpen go
fast<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.320> sake<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.650> sharpening<00:04:32.100> it

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
fast just for the sake of sharpening it

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.190 
fast just for the sake of sharpening it
so<00:04:32.340> we<00:04:32.430> actually<00:04:32.580> have<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.180> setting<00:04:33.840> set<00:04:34.110> up

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
so we actually have this setting set up

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.320 
so we actually have this setting set up
in<00:04:34.350> our<00:04:34.470> if<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:35.370> can<00:04:35.520> set<00:04:35.700> this<00:04:35.790> weekend<00:04:36.180> sharp

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
in our if we can set this weekend sharp

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.640 
in our if we can set this weekend sharp
us<00:04:36.480> a<00:04:36.540> lot<00:04:36.810> because<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.200> looked<00:04:37.380> like<00:04:37.470> it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
us a lot because it looked like it

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.980 
us a lot because it looked like it
wasn't<00:04:37.830> quite<00:04:38.040> focused<00:04:38.370> right<00:04:38.640> on<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.060> it's

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
wasn't quite focused right on and it's

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.270 
wasn't quite focused right on and it's
cool<00:04:40.170> to<00:04:40.350> if<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:40.680> one's<00:04:40.830> sharpen<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> lot

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
cool to if this one's sharpen a lot

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.530 
cool to if this one's sharpen a lot
because<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.520> kind<00:04:41.670> of<00:04:41.790> adds<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.090> nice<00:04:42.210> gritty

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
because I kind of adds a nice gritty

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.260 
because I kind of adds a nice gritty
field<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> image<00:04:43.230> too<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:43.710> that's<00:04:43.980> fine

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
field of the image too so that's fine

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.550 
field of the image too so that's fine
alright<00:04:45.270> let's<00:04:45.510> save<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.870> as<00:04:46.110> our<00:04:46.320> color

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
alright let's save this as our color

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.600 
alright let's save this as our color
corrected<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:48.740> then<00:04:49.740> same<00:04:50.130> thing<00:04:50.370> with<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
corrected and then same thing with this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.280 
corrected and then same thing with this
image<00:04:50.730> we<00:04:51.030> can<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:51.840> create<00:04:52.020> kind<00:04:52.200> of

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
image we can we can create kind of

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.660 
image we can we can create kind of
different<00:04:52.530> versions<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.950> it<00:04:53.070> if<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.310> cool<00:04:53.640> it

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
different versions of it if I cool it

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.210 
different versions of it if I cool it
off<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:54.780> still<00:04:54.840> looks<00:04:55.380> pretty<00:04:55.440> cool<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.950> like<00:04:56.190> a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
off it still looks pretty cool is like a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.210 
off it still looks pretty cool is like a
very<00:04:56.580> very<00:04:56.790> cold<00:04:57.030> image<00:04:57.420> like<00:04:57.720> right<00:04:57.930> here<00:04:58.220> so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
very very cold image like right here so

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.860 
very very cold image like right here so
i<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.340> create<00:04:59.670> another<00:04:59.880> snapshot<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.630> i<00:05:00.720> can

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
i can create another snapshot and i can

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.790 
i can create another snapshot and i can
say<00:05:01.160> this<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.280> going<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> be<00:05:02.520> moved<00:05:02.730> shot<00:05:03.800> cold

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
say this is going to be moved shot cold

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.490 
say this is going to be moved shot cold
i<00:05:06.740> can<00:05:07.740> pump<00:05:08.370> up<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.610> warmth<00:05:08.970> and<00:05:09.260> then<00:05:10.260> i<00:05:10.350> can

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
i can pump up the warmth and then i can

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.230 
i can pump up the warmth and then i can
pull<00:05:10.710> down<00:05:10.890> my<00:05:11.070> my<00:05:11.460> vibrance<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.000> kind<00:05:12.210> of

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
pull down my my vibrance and kind of

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.060 
pull down my my vibrance and kind of
create<00:05:12.510> this<00:05:12.630> monochromatic<00:05:13.140> tone<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.860> as

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
create this monochromatic tone to it as

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.610 
create this monochromatic tone to it as
well<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.730> in<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.180> warm<00:05:15.510> side<00:05:15.720> so<00:05:16.440> that's

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
well in the in the warm side so that's

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.980 
well in the in the warm side so that's
another<00:05:16.890> version<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.370> image<00:05:17.640> too<00:05:17.850> so<00:05:18.600> with

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
another version that image too so with

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.180 
another version that image too so with
these<00:05:19.080> mood<00:05:19.290> shots<00:05:19.560> i'm<00:05:19.680> going<00:05:19.800> to<00:05:19.860> undo<00:05:20.100> that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
these mood shots i'm going to undo that

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.530 
these mood shots i'm going to undo that
last<00:05:20.430> change<00:05:20.640> we'll<00:05:20.850> go<00:05:20.940> back<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.120> our<00:05:21.240> cool

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
last change we'll go back to our cool

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.050 
last change we'll go back to our cool
tone<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:23.160> point<00:05:23.370> with<00:05:23.460> these<00:05:23.580> moon<00:05:23.730> shots<00:05:23.940> is

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
tone the point with these moon shots is

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.480 
tone the point with these moon shots is
basically<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:25.010> with<00:05:26.010> these<00:05:26.130> types<00:05:26.400> of

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
basically that with these types of

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.100 
basically that with these types of
images<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:27.060> can<00:05:27.180> really<00:05:27.420> do<00:05:27.600> whatever<00:05:27.960> you

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
images you can really do whatever you

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.510 
images you can really do whatever you
want<00:05:28.350> with<00:05:28.410> them<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.800> i'll<00:05:28.890> point<00:05:29.160> out<00:05:29.310> some

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
want with them and i'll point out some

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.860 
want with them and i'll point out some
of<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.670> other<00:05:29.850> ones<00:05:30.060> that<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.270> think<00:05:30.510> kind<00:05:30.780> of

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
of the other ones that I think kind of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.200 
of the other ones that I think kind of
fit<00:05:31.050> in<00:05:31.140> this<00:05:31.200> category<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.610> image<00:05:32.880> of

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
fit in this category to this image of

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.320 
fit in this category to this image of
this<00:05:33.600> girl<00:05:33.870> in<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.140> in<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:35.120> whatever<00:05:36.120> it<00:05:36.240> is

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
this girl in this in this whatever it is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.300 
this girl in this in this whatever it is
she's<00:05:36.600> in<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.810> factory<00:05:37.140> I<00:05:37.170> guess<00:05:37.440> if<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:38.040> warm

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
she's in a factory I guess if I warm

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.920 
she's in a factory I guess if I warm
this<00:05:38.430> up<00:05:38.580> quite<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> bit<00:05:39.030> it<00:05:39.210> also<00:05:39.630> works<00:05:39.810> very

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
this up quite a bit it also works very

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.340 
this up quite a bit it also works very
very<00:05:40.110> well<00:05:40.290> as<00:05:40.620> a<00:05:40.650> very<00:05:41.040> warm<00:05:41.310> shot<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:43.170> would

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
very well as a very warm shot it would

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.810 
very well as a very warm shot it would
probably<00:05:43.560> also<00:05:43.710> work<00:05:44.040> well<00:05:44.220> as<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.430> really<00:05:44.640> cool

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
probably also work well as a really cool

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.760 
probably also work well as a really cool
shot<00:05:45.060> too<00:05:45.270> yeah<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:45.870> can<00:05:46.080> cool<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.380> down<00:05:46.410> quite<00:05:46.710> a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
shot too yeah I can cool it down quite a

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.400 
shot too yeah I can cool it down quite a
bit<00:05:46.830> as<00:05:47.040> well<00:05:47.450> so<00:05:48.450> let's<00:05:48.630> go<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:48.960> see<00:05:49.020> I'm

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
bit as well so let's go and see I'm

bit as well so let's go and see I'm
going<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.560> undo<00:05:49.800> both<00:05:49.979> those<00:05:50.220> actually<00:05:50.760> let's

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
going to undo both those actually let's

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.010 
going to undo both those actually let's
just<00:05:51.030> go<00:05:51.120> back<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.300> our<00:05:51.450> color<00:05:51.660> corrected

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
just go back to our color corrected

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.050 
just go back to our color corrected
version

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
other versions of mood shots that would

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.320 
other versions of mood shots that would
work<00:05:56.790> well<00:05:57.060> probably<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.660> stadium<00:05:58.170> image
