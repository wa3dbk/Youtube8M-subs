00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:11.040
 good guys was with the lower the sound tava 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.410
 king he 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.789
 he has his original budget, right? 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.600
 digital in the front and also like 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 dirty to damn but it 's original and here 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 the driver's seat was 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 wanting to tear this corner here aquino 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 a seat is not enough to get the black plate 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.920
 of this car that in a few years the self 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
 I want to keep the original stew 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.730
 same as the expense but I intend to keep 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.440
 Original and then I never liked cover 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 But I said, I'm going to put a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 less the two ahead to give a 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 insured 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.719
 I put it was so absurd I 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.770
 I found a cover with this part here 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.510
 is very similar to the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.149
 original car without at least one year 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.979
 so roughly it passes kind of 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 beat and did not stay that much tapes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 grotesque yes that poorly done finish 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.520
 is cover we see there is a 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.520
 tech theme cap a reasonable seam 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 I think it was in harmony with the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 car for now you can handle it and without 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 problem 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 in depend on jeans and wore 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 button itself was already pulling the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 your originals, right? 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.200
 So I decided to do that. 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.900
 it was good 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 Another thing I did was this 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.240
 support hard here because the belt 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.259
 because the original was half 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 Mmm. 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.579
 it was a gift a vinyl that had and I did 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.430
 an iron support 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.680
 they stay straight in this way to 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.049
 I love you toninho good to fuck me 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 liked it 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.680
 you can see that the quality is not so 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.569
 bad with other covers that we come 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.219
 around 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.140
 and was cool zinho the region 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.140
 That's it, people were going to say a hug.
