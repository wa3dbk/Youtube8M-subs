00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:17.810
 infant 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.130
 a new game encompassed in the boxing genre that will not come 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 to Spain from the hand of the company Jim Keyes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580
 as we can already imagine by the name of the game itself 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.990
 it is a title based on the famous hand yesterday and promoter of 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.550
 boxers don king 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.640
 and precisely one of the many characteristics with which we 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.650
 we will find I will be able to put ourselves in the shoes of an agent who will have to 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 manage the professional life of the different boxers 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.510
 bush 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.440
 in any case we will be only allows us to participate the only combat 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 choosing between only two fighters 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.470
 although the full version of the game will have a total of 40 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 all of them real fighters having both old and great legends 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.470
 figures of today 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.330
 and if these do not 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 we will also have the possibility of creating one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.940
 we will also be only allowed to play in the modest edition but in the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940
 final game there will be many more 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 and all multiplayer 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 being the latter one of the main claims of the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.510
 offering support to depart towards him 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
 up to eight users 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 happening and promote its gameplay the mechanics of 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.280
 leave it aside any arcade component we bet is much more for the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.740
 simulation as realistic as possible so it is a 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.719
 specially designed to delight the true fans of this 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.609
 sport 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.299
 and in fact when we play in career mode we can relive all the 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.439
 paraphernalia that revolves around the world of boxing almost as if it were a 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.279
 sports documentary fearing for example that going to the gym to train 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.279
 and improve our skills 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.829
 finally a curious detail that at least we have seen in this demo 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.619
 is that even though during the fighting the voice of the 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.359
 militarist been dubbed into Castilian 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.499
 the game characters keep 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:56.579
 their original voices in English something that will predictably remain the 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 same way in the final version 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.089
