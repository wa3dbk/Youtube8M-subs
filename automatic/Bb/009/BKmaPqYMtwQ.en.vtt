 the boys find the ones that are 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.809
 present accessories of the announcement that is i 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.550
 two cables up to 4gb in fact 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.590
 the power of the case you have a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 power supply that does not support however not 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.480
 you want to do you listened to a power supply 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
 cable that demi news is known as always 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.180
 wind a change that inside the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.829
 deployable here today so thanks to a 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.899
 the great distraction they make it for i 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 absolutely given with a symbol of the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.899
 spy jumper vga ddai and the usual ones of 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 an awesome utility we pass by 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.049
 now immediately what is important 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.080
 so let's talk about the magnificent 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.540
 r no let's say today with a function that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.960
 prevents shocks to the card ie to a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.200
 immediately the magnificence is a card 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.970
 replaces 2 euros and the wall is really 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.960
 beautiful even if physically present a 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.960
 we arrive immediately in plastic spain 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 perugia 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.210
 let's start immediately talking about ours 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.219
 fantastic card with the first thing 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.009
 clearly these real jumps to the eye 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.630
 and fans that go to cool everything 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.909
 the layout of our card are 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.369
 speaking of three fans in theory all 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.020
 and three 90 mm but in reality the power plant 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.280
 it's a little smaller than those 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 lateral principle that also the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.090
 undersigned has not found go 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.399
 this seems a little smaller 80 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.429
 sink is called tricks of the 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.739
 house knows ago was in fact made of you go 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.340
 affixed to cool to the maximum 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:05.649
 power 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.500
 what this huge radiator 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.269
 divided into two parts with five ram parts 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.610
 and therefore he certainly does not have 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.129
 saved on the sink so there 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 will be a real report of 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.760
 precisely heat thanks to this it binds 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.440
 two 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.250
 while regarding the dimensions 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.510
 of this card we talk about a card 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.640
 definitely very large 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.769
 long as we are at 30.8 centimeters 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.720
 as regards the length of the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.609
 total card while regarding 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.410
 the height is 11.3 centimeters and the 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.230
 depth is four centimeters 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.480
 scarce and let's say the first card that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.090
 we see juices of a 100 euro that I have 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.950
 a backplate so you saw the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
 new mini size of generous me 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.670
 felt motor 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.889
 let's say number embody the pcb e 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.569
 demeanor was abounds in secret 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.599
 this backplate blackplane that goes too 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.560
 cool periore partners 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.880
 continuing with the description of the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.950
 our card we go to see a little 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.650
 specifically the doors it offers 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.810
 which are the most classic then in 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.709
 in this case we have a displayport one 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.150
 hdmi and two of b aic as in most 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.730
 classic configurations 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.640
 current videos we also have support 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:27.700
 for wesley and mantle open cl 4.3 and where 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.780
 dtx 11.2 let's see how state 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.780
 sestiere on our benz 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.799
 now our beautiful and have 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.090
 visited in stock singh we pass some 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.459
 technical feature 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.709
 the architecture of this card is like 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.689
 saurik steam il with 1,200 data streams 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.750
 processor and power boom technology 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.150
 the frequency is over 1150 then binds 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.760
 one hundred more than the reflex card 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.310
 that then are the two gigabytes of tumors g 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.040
 dl n 5 operate 6,000 the year 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.930
 according to the 5600 of the scania nation 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.970
 moreover he always owns make of 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.159
 feeding with regard to the GPU 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.620
 it is a feeding phase as far as 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.819
 concerns the memories with an excellent 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.769
 prospect of overclocking 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.930
 regarding the power supply of 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.670
 this tab as you can see also 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.340
 from the connected cables 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.750
 we have two 6-pin connectors for 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.759
 feed our card 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.910
 regarding a small focus 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.669
 on the temperatures of our gpu 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:29.550
 we can say that they range from 35 in 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:31.180
 idle mode and the 74 in full that 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.590
 compared to those that are 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.960
 frequencies of our card are 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.030
 really good so we can say 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.800
 that our heat sink works at 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.659
 great consumption of this card 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.979
 guys are obviously bigger 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.060
 compared to that reappears if yes 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.740
 around 130 in idle to 260 watts an hour 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.020
 we let you hear a classy clip of 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.650
 a few seconds where we record 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.979
 what is the noise of this card 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.979
 here 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.280
 as you could hear from the pre 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.639
 boys cloudiness top more 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.590
 low we go from 42 to 45 decibels 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.180
 so let's say that if you have to 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.710
 keep your computer used 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.780
 also to download we say that it is not 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.160
 just the right card for you though 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.380
 let's now talk about it more 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.940
 interesting that is the benchmarks for how much 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.090
 it's about the benchmarks we could 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.650
 make us on this card with two 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.419
 of the most famous games currently in 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.580
 trade then tomb raider and in 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.620
 battlefield 4 that you will all know 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.440
 surely we can say that the 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.820
 performance of this card in 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.900
 high configuration and where you fall 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.050
 they average 51 fps as far as 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.300
 concerns tomb raiders and 57 reached 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.070
 even with regards to beats 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.570
 four film yes general we can say 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.039
 in this tab it supports all games 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.599
 to the movement in commerce 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.940
 maybe you have to give up some filters 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.680
 pro light reassurance plus yours 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.780
 you play well guys come to 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.909
 conclusions our usual conclusions 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.789
 end we can say that this card 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:11.199
 definitely enters the top of the 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.570
 best company currently on the market 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.330
 we can not but give him one e 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.130
 middle of this siena and here price 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.570
 recommended here we did not find how 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.640
 given of the president to 185 but 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:26.270
 that's why it's all we see in 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.270
 next videos
