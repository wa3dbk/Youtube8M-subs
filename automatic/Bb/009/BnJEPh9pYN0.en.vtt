00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.979 
hybrid memory cube are HMC as we call it
sure<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.469> several<00:00:40.980> years<00:00:41.100> ago<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.670> had

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
sure so several years ago we had

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.270 
sure so several years ago we had
multiple<00:00:42.989> engineering<00:00:43.530> teams<00:00:43.770> working

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
multiple engineering teams working

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
multiple engineering teams working
together<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:45.000> try<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.239> come<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:46.110> idea

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
together to try to come up with an idea

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.790 
together to try to come up with an idea
on<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.360> innovate<00:00:48.360> new<00:00:49.170> technology

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
on how do we innovate new technology

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
on how do we innovate new technology
especially<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> DRAM<00:00:50.820> space<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> try<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
especially in the DRAM space and try to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.950 
especially in the DRAM space and try to
come<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> technology<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.960> bring

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
come up with a technology that can bring

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.439 
come up with a technology that can bring
more<00:00:55.140> value<00:00:55.320> add<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.670> DRAM<00:00:57.059> space

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
more value add back to the DRAM space

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.830 
more value add back to the DRAM space
and<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.399> these<00:00:59.399> guys<00:00:59.640> all<00:00:59.699> sat<00:01:00.210> together<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and so these guys all sat together and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
and so these guys all sat together and
worked<00:01:01.260> diligently<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.980> came<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.730> an

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
worked diligently and came up with an

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
worked diligently and came up with an
incredible<00:01:03.690> technology<00:01:04.019> called<00:01:04.680> hybrid

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
incredible technology called hybrid

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
incredible technology called hybrid
memory<00:01:05.309> cube<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.650> basically<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.270> good

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
memory cube and basically it was so good

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
memory cube and basically it was so good
that<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.500> decided<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.159> our<00:01:11.220> executive<00:01:11.460> teams

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that we decided that our executive teams

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.499 
that we decided that our executive teams
decided<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.140> should<00:01:13.409> create<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
decided that we should create a

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.820 
decided that we should create a
essentially<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> mini<00:01:15.780> business<00:01:16.020> unit<00:01:16.619> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
essentially a mini business unit that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
essentially a mini business unit that
would<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.759> responsible<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> technology

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
would be responsible for the technology

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
would be responsible for the technology
ensuring<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.250> enable<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.360> can

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
ensuring that we enable it that we can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.960 
ensuring that we enable it that we can
mass-produce<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.979> technology<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.820> can

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
mass-produce this technology that we can

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.330 
mass-produce this technology that we can
bring<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> market<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.710> therefore<00:01:25.890> they

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
bring it to market and so therefore they

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.880 
bring it to market and so therefore they
asked<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> come<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> become<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
asked me to come in and and become the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
asked me to come in and and become the
general<00:01:29.130> manager<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.180> technology<00:01:30.600> in

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
general manager for this technology in

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.039 
general manager for this technology in
this<00:01:31.140> group<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> bring<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.460> production

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
this group and bring it to production

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
this group and bring it to production
well<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> HMC<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.520> makes<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
well what is HMC and what makes it so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
well what is HMC and what makes it so
revolutionary<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.829> hyper<00:01:38.310> memory<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
revolutionary so hyper memory is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.980 
revolutionary so hyper memory is
essentially<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> logic<00:01:41.220> layer<00:01:41.400> base

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
essentially it is a logic layer base

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
essentially it is a logic layer base
that<00:01:42.990> has<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> memory<00:01:44.009> control<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that has all of the memory control and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
that has all of the memory control and
then<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> simplified<00:01:45.450> DRAM<00:01:46.110> later

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
then we have a simplified DRAM later

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.800 
then we have a simplified DRAM later
that<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.590> stack<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.070> top<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
that we stack on top of that and the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
that we stack on top of that and the
stack<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.409> anywhere<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:49.829> four<00:01:50.310> DRAM

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
stack can be anywhere from four DRAM

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
stack can be anywhere from four DRAM
slices<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> DRAM<00:01:52.439> slices<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.570> it's<00:01:54.570> what's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
slices to a DRAM slices and it's what's

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.740 
slices to a DRAM slices and it's what's
incredible<00:01:55.829> about<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.460> technology<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
incredible about the technology is the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.719 
incredible about the technology is the
3d<00:01:58.229> aspect<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> where<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.549> use

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
3d aspect of it where we use

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.420 
3d aspect of it where we use
through-silicon<00:02:00.420> vias<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.430> interconnect

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
through-silicon vias to interconnect

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.639 
through-silicon vias to interconnect
basically<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> DRAM<00:02:03.780> layers<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.259> logic

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
basically the DRAM layers and logic

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.080 
basically the DRAM layers and logic
layer<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.189> by<00:02:05.729> doing<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.240> we're<00:02:06.600> allowed<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
layer and by doing that we're allowed to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.059 
layer and by doing that we're allowed to
have<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> technology<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.140> has<00:02:09.619> high

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
have a technology that has high

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
performance and low energy and it also

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.380 
performance and low energy and it also
consumes<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.220> much<00:02:16.370> smaller<00:02:16.730> footprint<00:02:17.300> than

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
technology in a module form so when we

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.729 
technology in a module form so when we
couple<00:02:23.209> all<00:02:23.450> those<00:02:23.630> things<00:02:23.870> together<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:24.590> we

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
couple all those things together then we

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.979 
couple all those things together then we
really<00:02:25.069> we've<00:02:25.640> we've<00:02:26.030> basically<00:02:26.360> taken<00:02:26.630> a

really we've we've basically taken a

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.660 
really we've we've basically taken a
bunch<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.319> innovative<00:02:27.950> pieces<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.519> then

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
bunch of innovative pieces and then

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.640 
bunch of innovative pieces and then
created<00:02:29.000> one<00:02:29.209> giant<00:02:29.690> innovative<00:02:30.140> piece<00:02:30.349> in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
created one giant innovative piece in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.320 
created one giant innovative piece in
hybrid<00:02:31.010> memory<00:02:31.250> cube<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.790> where<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> see

memory cube what that does is it breaks

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.099 
memory cube what that does is it breaks
down<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.370> memory<00:03:19.670> wall<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.510> is<00:03:20.720> true<00:03:20.900> has

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
down the memory wall that is true has

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.860 
down the memory wall that is true has
traditionally<00:03:21.590> been<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.890> there<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:23.239> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
traditionally been out there and it it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.800 
traditionally been out there and it it
really<00:03:24.290> allows<00:03:24.620> for<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.489> high<00:03:26.180> performance

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
really allows for a high performance

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.410 
really allows for a high performance
computing<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:28.280> has<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.760> lot<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.090> data<00:03:29.329> that

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
computing that has a lot of data that

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.979 
computing that has a lot of data that
comes<00:03:29.750> through<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.230> as<00:03:30.440> well<00:03:30.799> as<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.780> uses<00:03:32.780> less

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
comes through it as well as it uses less

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.360 
comes through it as well as it uses less
energy<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.650> essentially<00:03:34.100> what<00:03:34.190> we're<00:03:34.340> doing

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
energy so essentially what we're doing

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.819 
energy so essentially what we're doing
is<00:03:34.819> were<00:03:35.030> we're<00:03:35.959> able<00:03:36.109> to<00:03:36.410> have<00:03:36.709> the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
is were we're able to have the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.819 
is were we're able to have the
performance<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.639> a<00:03:37.819> Ferrari<00:03:38.209> per<00:03:38.540> se<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.350> have

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
performance of a Ferrari per se and have

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.390 
performance of a Ferrari per se and have
the<00:03:39.980> gas<00:03:40.280> efficiency<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.269> a<00:03:41.660> Toyota<00:03:42.590> Prius<00:03:42.799> and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the gas efficiency of a Toyota Prius and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.039 
the gas efficiency of a Toyota Prius and
so<00:03:43.790> for<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.090> first<00:03:44.209> time<00:03:44.450> ever<00:03:44.690> we've<00:03:44.900> been

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
so for the first time ever we've been

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.150 
so for the first time ever we've been
able<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.319> do<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.620> with<00:03:45.829> this<00:03:45.920> type<00:03:46.100> of

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
able to do that with this type of

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.819 
able to do that with this type of
technology<00:03:46.840> also<00:03:47.840> perhaps<00:03:48.079> for<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.590> first

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
technology also perhaps for the first

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.190 
technology also perhaps for the first
time<00:03:49.069> ever<00:03:49.340> we've<00:03:49.970> formed<00:03:50.450> some<00:03:50.720> interesting

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
time ever we've formed some interesting

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.809 
time ever we've formed some interesting
collaborations<00:03:51.920> at<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.280> beginning<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.760> said

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
collaborations at the beginning I said

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.610 
collaborations at the beginning I said
we<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.630> has<00:03:53.840> sparked<00:03:54.139> some<00:03:54.170> unusual

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
we this has sparked some unusual

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.220 
we this has sparked some unusual
partnerships<00:03:55.280> including<00:03:55.910> one<00:03:56.569> with<00:03:56.750> Samsung

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
partnerships including one with Samsung

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.559 
partnerships including one with Samsung
talked<00:03:57.829> about<00:03:58.100> that<00:03:58.220> very<00:03:58.700> interesting<00:03:59.239> so

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
talked about that very interesting so

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.050 
talked about that very interesting so
one<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.190> creative<00:04:01.579> things<00:04:01.819> that<00:04:01.910> we

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
one of the the creative things that we

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.809 
one of the the creative things that we
had<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> do<00:04:02.450> with<00:04:02.569> this<00:04:02.690> technology<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.530> that

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
had to do with this technology is that

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.870 
had to do with this technology is that
the<00:04:04.819> OEMs<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.709> industry<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:07.310> general<00:04:07.519> is

the OEMs and the industry in general is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.090 
the OEMs and the industry in general is

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.009 
wouldn't wouldn't be as successful in
taking<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.169> technology<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:19.010> more<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:20.330> mass

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
taking this technology to more of a mass

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.099 
taking this technology to more of a mass

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.529 
volume or mass
production<00:04:22.639> it<00:04:23.639> would<00:04:23.759> become<00:04:24.090> more<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.449> a

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
production it would become more of a

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.749 
production it would become more of a
niche<00:04:24.780> product<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.979> when<00:04:26.159> we<00:04:26.280> sat<00:04:26.699> down

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
niche product and and when we sat down

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.730 
niche product and and when we sat down
early<00:04:27.240> on<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.659> decided<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.289> you<00:04:28.530> know<00:04:28.620> we

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
early on and decided that you know we

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.439 
early on and decided that you know we
want<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.009> take<00:04:29.189> this<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.849> have<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.240> bring

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
want to take this and have this bring

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.719 
want to take this and have this bring
that<00:04:30.569> value<00:04:30.960> add<00:04:31.110> back<00:04:31.409> into<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> memory<00:04:31.979> and

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
that value add back into the memory and

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.399 
that value add back into the memory and
really<00:04:32.939> take<00:04:33.120> this<00:04:33.300> thing<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.599> market<00:04:34.199> and

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
really take this thing to market and

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.439 
really take this thing to market and
have<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:35.009> broad<00:04:35.340> adoption<00:04:35.969> in<00:04:36.090> multiple

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
have a very broad adoption in multiple

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.100 
have a very broad adoption in multiple
applications<00:04:37.189> multiple<00:04:38.189> segments<00:04:38.939> and<00:04:39.180> so<00:04:39.419> we

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
applications multiple segments and so we

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.450 
applications multiple segments and so we
realized<00:04:40.469> that<00:04:40.530> we<00:04:40.680> had<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.949> partner<00:04:41.219> up<00:04:41.430> with

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
realized that we had to partner up with

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.429 
realized that we had to partner up with
someone<00:04:42.060> who<00:04:42.360> could<00:04:42.629> also<00:04:42.930> produce<00:04:43.289> the

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439 
someone who could also produce the

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:46.879 
someone who could also produce the
technology<00:04:44.219> and<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.550> therefore<00:04:45.020> we<00:04:46.020> we<00:04:46.650> sat

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
technology and so therefore we we sat

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.770 
technology and so therefore we we sat
down<00:04:46.919> with<00:04:47.280> Samsung<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.389> already<00:04:48.509> had<00:04:48.750> a

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
down with Samsung and we already had a

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.200 
down with Samsung and we already had a
cross<00:04:49.050> license<00:04:49.439> agreement<00:04:49.889> with<00:04:50.009> Samsung<00:04:50.460> to

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
cross license agreement with Samsung to

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.179 
cross license agreement with Samsung to
begin<00:04:51.659> with<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:52.439> made<00:04:52.620> sense<00:04:52.860> from

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
begin with and so it made sense from

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.929 
begin with and so it made sense from
Samsung's

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:53.939 
Samsung's

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.659 
Samsung's
technical<00:04:54.719> capabilities<00:04:55.409> as<00:04:56.129> well<00:04:56.189> as<00:04:56.430> that

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
technical capabilities as well as that

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.129 
technical capabilities as well as that
they<00:04:56.819> had<00:04:56.939> the<00:04:57.060> financial<00:04:57.270> means<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.960> be<00:04:58.050> able

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
they had the financial means to be able

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.540 
they had the financial means to be able
to<00:04:58.259> come<00:04:58.469> up<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.740> speed<00:04:58.770> quickly<00:04:59.219> on<00:04:59.460> this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
to come up to speed quickly on this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.010 
to come up to speed quickly on this
technology<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.509> then<00:05:00.629> we<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.870> work

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
technology and then we can work

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.260 
technology and then we can work
collaboratively<00:05:01.199> together<00:05:02.069> in<00:05:02.879> order<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
collaboratively together in order to

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.990 
collaboratively together in order to
bring<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.199> technology<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.860> market<00:05:05.039> while

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
bring the technology to market while

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.610 
bring the technology to market while
Samsung<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.599> certainly<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.139> biggest<00:05:07.469> they're

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
Samsung is certainly the biggest they're

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.230 
Samsung is certainly the biggest they're
not<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.889> only<00:05:08.009> technology<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:09.000> we're

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
not the only technology that we're

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.149 
not the only technology that we're
working<00:05:09.360> with<00:05:09.659> on<00:05:09.840> this<00:05:09.990> project<00:05:10.229> explained

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
working with on this project explained

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.469 
working with on this project explained

design to and with with this particular

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.920 
design to and with with this particular
technology<00:05:38.339> we<00:05:38.819> wanted<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.210> go<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.539> market

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
technology we wanted to go to market

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.529 
technology we wanted to go to market
very<00:05:40.169> quickly<00:05:40.469> and<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.009> therefore<00:05:41.300> we<00:05:42.300> felt

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
very quickly and so therefore we felt

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:45.320 
very quickly and so therefore we felt
that<00:05:42.750> an<00:05:42.990> outside<00:05:43.440> consortium<00:05:44.129> that<00:05:44.400> has<00:05:44.969> a

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
that an outside consortium that has a

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.369 
that an outside consortium that has a
focused<00:05:46.110> group<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.919> members<00:05:47.960> those<00:05:48.960> members

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:49.379 
focused group of members those members

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.350 
focused group of members those members
today<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.190> know<00:05:50.279> are<00:05:50.430> key<00:05:50.639> developers<00:05:51.150> that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
today you know are key developers that

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.550 
today you know are key developers that
are<00:05:51.449> really<00:05:51.659> focused<00:05:52.020> on<00:05:52.110> networking

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
are really focused on networking

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.920 
are really focused on networking
segments<00:05:53.310> and<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:54.089> some<00:05:54.300> high<00:05:54.449> performance
