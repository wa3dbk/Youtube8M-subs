earth producing circular features we

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.250 
earth producing circular features we
think<00:04:54.730> this<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.000> Big<00:04:55.300> Bend<00:04:55.600> area<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:58.170> Texas

this<00:05:02.260> is<00:05:02.320> an<00:05:02.650> interesting<00:05:03.250> sideways<00:05:04.210> view<00:05:04.450> of

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
this is an interesting sideways view of

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.800 
this is an interesting sideways view of

Cuba coming into the picture lower right
and<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.520> believe<00:05:24.730> is<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.390> coast<00:05:25.810> of

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
and this I believe is the coast of

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.900 
and this I believe is the coast of
northern<00:05:28.420> Chile<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:29.350> South<00:05:29.740> America<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:30.880> a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
northern Chile in South America it's a

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.010 
northern Chile in South America it's a
very<00:05:31.090> straight<00:05:31.510> coast

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
very straight coast

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.980 
very straight coast
except<00:05:32.770> for<00:05:32.920> that<00:05:33.070> strange<00:05:33.690> headland<00:05:34.690> out<00:05:34.810> to

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.350 
except for that strange headland out to
the<00:05:35.080> top-right<00:05:35.320> just<00:05:35.740> disappearing<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.520> so

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
the top-right just disappearing and so

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.470 
the top-right just disappearing and so
the<00:05:37.540> desert<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.200> this<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:39.010> first<00:05:39.310> part<00:05:39.730> of<00:05:40.000> the

the desert is this the first part of the

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.140 
the desert is this the first part of the
inland<00:05:41.200> zone<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:42.130> then<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:42.700> see<00:05:42.880> much

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
inland zone and then you see much

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150
