00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 jan people in this video you see that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 unboxing to the brand new iphone 5c in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 yellow, as you surely knew 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 I stood in a line and I have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.449
 i bought the iphone 5s i bought myself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.580
 but no iphone 5 cd buys in 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.949
 Apple store on the spot but I have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.660
 online pre-order from the week since me 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.199
 just had to take more equipment 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 today from 5 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 just arrived the 50 and pack 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.300
 we all looked like this now 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.700
 The packaging looks like it 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.170
 Packing an ipod touch up here 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.820
 everything so transparent that you have the iphone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.649
 Immediately it looks like but 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 easily a shaped or a bit 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.629
 such a pill fits well in the hand 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.079
 Friends are just the device for me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 case yellow with yellow wallpaper 7 cm 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.210
 We can also use the device from the side 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 see in yellow around apple logo iphone 5 c 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.109
 another side behind me 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 then also information and that we the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.570
 16 gigabyte variant have as said 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.369
 like the ipods we have one 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.369
 stripes have to pull off more 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.970
 Here we can top the lid 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.970
 lose weight 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.479
 then a plastic part of the iphone 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.000
 then here again helau this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.979
 welcome skype here the iphone 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 the coffins in my opinion could to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.909
 first to the accessories then again a tab 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.869
 to the goal 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 Here we come to Hello to the little guide 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.290
 now probably where exactly synonymous 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.299
 at the very back apple stickers are yes then 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.020
 like apple iphone 5, it has apple i 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.299
 pods in it 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.549
 the power adapter and your lightning cable 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.119
 to charge and sync from that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.829
 iphone 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.409
 unfortunately I have unboxing the iphone 5 s 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.579
 the device does not really show that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.259
 I will do it here, though 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.280
 Since I have the film deducted 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.959
 The device must be with it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.230
 if I can get out of here then so 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.830
 turn and then we have the iphone for 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.040
 it also here in front because not know the front 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.230
 or black front then yellow and yellow 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 I have to say it feels very much 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 like in hand 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.709
 that's really great to keep cool 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.590
 does not feel cheap or anything like that 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.769
 I have to say it somehow feels 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.379
 more like a 5 to keep it iphone 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.480
 So I like feeling is watching us 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.239
 time is at the recesses for example 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.060
 so that the volume keys switch to the ju 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.030
 above the power button below the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.010
 headphone input a micro direct 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.440
 and speaker rechtsamt the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.870
 Nanos in the sled as I say and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.540
 behind we see next to beautiful glossy 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.799
 yellow iphone 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.290
 I also have a black iphone here 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.030
 5 c case bought thinks it fits very well 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.720
 come together as one more time a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.440
 yes, that was it with the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.870
 unboxing from the yellow iphone 15 16 gb 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.519
