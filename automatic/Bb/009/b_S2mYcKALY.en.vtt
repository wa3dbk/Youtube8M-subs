00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
in this video I'd like to talk a little

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.330 
in this video I'd like to talk a little
bit<00:00:06.729> about<00:00:06.759> IBM<00:00:07.509> model<00:00:07.810> M<00:00:08.129> cables<00:00:09.129> and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
bit about IBM model M cables and

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.299 
bit about IBM model M cables and
connectors<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.780> what<00:00:10.990> you<00:00:11.110> can<00:00:11.260> expect<00:00:11.679> maybe

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309 
connectors and what you can expect maybe

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.100 
connectors and what you can expect maybe
you<00:00:12.519> picked<00:00:12.759> up<00:00:12.880> a<00:00:13.030> model<00:00:13.330> in<00:00:13.450> keyboard<00:00:13.750> but

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
you picked up a model in keyboard but

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.600 
you picked up a model in keyboard but
you<00:00:14.200> don't<00:00:14.380> have<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:14.740> cable<00:00:15.099> or<00:00:15.190> didn't<00:00:15.429> come

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
you don't have the cable or didn't come

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.220 
you don't have the cable or didn't come
with<00:00:15.759> one<00:00:15.940> or<00:00:16.059> you<00:00:16.150> just<00:00:16.270> want<00:00:16.509> to<00:00:16.540> know<00:00:16.689> what

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
with one or you just want to know what

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.900 
with one or you just want to know what
typically<00:00:17.650> what<00:00:18.189> kind<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.400> cabling<00:00:18.790> it

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
typically what kind of cabling it

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.189 
typically what kind of cabling it
requires<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.450> how<00:00:19.540> to<00:00:19.600> connect<00:00:19.900> it<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.050> your

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
requires and how to connect it to your

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.529 
requires and how to connect it to your
computer<00:00:20.260> well<00:00:21.130> this<00:00:21.250> is<00:00:21.340> the<00:00:21.760> typical<00:00:22.029> cable

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
computer well this is the typical cable

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.390 
computer well this is the typical cable
that<00:00:23.289> would<00:00:23.470> either<00:00:23.680> come<00:00:23.949> with<00:00:24.010> four<00:00:24.310> that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
that would either come with four that

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.790 
that would either come with four that
you<00:00:24.550> can<00:00:24.670> buy<00:00:24.850> for<00:00:25.240> your<00:00:25.410> model<00:00:26.410> M

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800

it's a coiled keyboard cable and it's

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's a coiled keyboard cable and it's
called<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.650> SDL<00:00:30.519> cable<00:00:31.090> now<00:00:31.359> I<00:00:31.390> don't<00:00:31.630> even<00:00:31.689> know

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
called a SDL cable now I don't even know

called a SDL cable now I don't even know
what<00:00:32.050> SD<00:00:32.379> l<00:00:32.470> stands<00:00:32.800> for<00:00:32.920> maybe<00:00:33.250> someone<00:00:33.610> else

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
what SD l stands for maybe someone else

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.910 
what SD l stands for maybe someone else
can<00:00:33.940> chime<00:00:34.150> in<00:00:34.269> who<00:00:34.480> knows<00:00:34.660> but<00:00:35.379> this<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.799> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
can chime in who knows but this is the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920 
can chime in who knows but this is the
standard<00:00:36.220> connector<00:00:36.670> that's<00:00:37.089> used<00:00:37.330> on<00:00:37.600> all

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
IBM model M keyboards that you might

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.479 
IBM model M keyboards that you might
find<00:00:40.269> on<00:00:40.540> auction<00:00:41.440> sites<00:00:41.470> or<00:00:41.949> at<00:00:42.040> thrift<00:00:42.280> shops

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.060 
find on auction sites or at thrift shops
and<00:00:42.729> whatever<00:00:43.049> this<00:00:44.049> particular<00:00:44.680> cable<00:00:44.979> that

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
and whatever this particular cable that

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.560 
and whatever this particular cable that
I'm<00:00:45.159> holding<00:00:45.309> in<00:00:45.460> my<00:00:45.519> hand<00:00:45.790> was<00:00:46.000> not<00:00:46.150> actually

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
I'm holding in my hand was not actually

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.539 
I'm holding in my hand was not actually
made<00:00:46.780> it's<00:00:47.110> not<00:00:47.229> original<00:00:47.710> it's<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.369> third

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
made it's not original it's a third

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.700 
made it's not original it's a third
party<00:00:48.970> cable<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:49.540> it's<00:00:49.659> a<00:00:49.809> compatible<00:00:50.379> cable

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
party cable but it's a compatible cable

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.890 
party cable but it's a compatible cable
so<00:00:51.489> they<00:00:51.760> will<00:00:51.909> roughly<00:00:52.239> look<00:00:52.390> like<00:00:52.540> this<00:00:52.690> and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
so they will roughly look like this and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.380 
so they will roughly look like this and
be<00:00:53.019> coiled<00:00:53.470> and<00:00:53.619> usually<00:00:54.400> they're<00:00:54.519> called<00:00:54.790> ps2

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
be coiled and usually they're called ps2

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.509 
be coiled and usually they're called ps2
you<00:00:55.780> know<00:00:55.900> SDL<00:00:56.379> cables<00:00:56.830> because<00:00:56.979> it's<00:00:57.129> got<00:00:57.309> a

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
you know SDL cables because it's got a

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.060 
you know SDL cables because it's got a
ps2<00:00:58.210> connector<00:00:58.839> on<00:00:58.930> one<00:00:58.960> end<00:00:59.140> which<00:00:59.799> is<00:00:59.920> what

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
ps2 connector on one end which is what

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.549 
ps2 connector on one end which is what
you<00:01:00.159> see<00:01:00.339> here<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.390> SDL<00:01:01.930> connector<00:01:02.470> on

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
you see here and the SDL connector on

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.929 
you see here and the SDL connector on
the<00:01:02.589> other<00:01:02.830> end<00:01:03.159> which<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.309> see<00:01:03.580> here<00:01:03.699> on<00:01:03.760> the

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
the other end which you see here on the

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.990 
the other end which you see here on the
left<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.960> SDL<00:01:05.439> connector<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.189> connector

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
left the SDL connector is the connector

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.320 
left the SDL connector is the connector
that<00:01:07.090> plugs<00:01:07.150> into<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:08.560> back<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.490> model<00:01:10.210> M

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
that plugs into the back of the model M

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.550 
that plugs into the back of the model M
keyboard<00:01:10.360> as<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.870> can<00:01:10.990> see<00:01:11.110> right<00:01:11.260> here<00:01:11.290> it

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
keyboard as you can see right here it

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.870 
keyboard as you can see right here it
almost<00:01:11.830> looks<00:01:12.070> like<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.220> thick<00:01:12.490> kind<00:01:12.790> of

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
almost looks like a thick kind of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.090 
almost looks like a thick kind of
Ethernet<00:01:13.240> plug<00:01:14.170> or<00:01:14.380> something<00:01:14.620> like<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:14.770> or

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
Ethernet plug or something like that or

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.440 
Ethernet plug or something like that or
Ethernet<00:01:15.550> connector<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.940> it<00:01:18.940> will<00:01:19.060> just<00:01:19.210> plug

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
Ethernet connector and it will just plug

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.320 
Ethernet connector and it will just plug
in<00:01:19.600> right<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.930> like<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:22.240> know

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
in right that like that so so you know

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.290 
in right that like that so so you know
this<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.660> just<00:01:22.810> line<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:23.530> up<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:25.060> got

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
this you just line this up and it's got

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.500 
this you just line this up and it's got
a<00:01:25.350> thick<00:01:26.350> side<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:26.890> it's<00:01:27.640> got<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> thick<00:01:28.090> part

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
a thick side and it's got a thick part

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.090 
a thick side and it's got a thick part
in<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.780> thin<00:01:29.050> part<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.410> just<00:01:29.590> kind<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.770> line<00:01:29.950> it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
in a thin part you just kind of line it

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.670 
in a thin part you just kind of line it
up<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.090> pops<00:01:31.300> right<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.600> there<00:01:31.750> kind

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
up and it just pops right in there kind

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.950 
up and it just pops right in there kind
of<00:01:32.740> with<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> click<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:34.150> won't<00:01:34.330> come<00:01:34.570> out<00:01:34.720> if

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
of with a click and it won't come out if

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200 
of with a click and it won't come out if
you<00:01:35.110> try<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.620> pull<00:01:35.800> it<00:01:35.890> out<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.280> have<00:01:36.430> to<00:01:36.580> use

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
you try to pull it out you have to use

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.340 
you try to pull it out you have to use
these<00:01:37.390> tabs<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:38.470> pull<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:38.920> out<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.450> that's<00:01:41.110> on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
these tabs to pull it out so that's on

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.460 
these tabs to pull it out so that's on
the<00:01:41.440> keyboard<00:01:41.830> side<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:43.180> model<00:01:43.840> M<00:01:43.960> keyboards

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
the keyboard side so model M keyboards

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.399 
the keyboard side so model M keyboards
that<00:01:44.560> have<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.360> removable<00:01:46.810> keyboard<00:01:47.260> will

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that have the removable keyboard will

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.649 
that have the removable keyboard will
have<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:47.710> connector<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.190> one<00:01:48.220> end<00:01:48.510> so<00:01:49.510> then

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
have this connector on one end so then

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.940 
have this connector on one end so then
the<00:01:49.780> question<00:01:49.870> becomes<00:01:50.170> how<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.620> you<00:01:50.680> connect

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
the question becomes how do you connect

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.800 
the question becomes how do you connect
it<00:01:51.070> into<00:01:51.310> your<00:01:51.430> modern-day<00:01:51.820> computer<00:01:52.270> well<00:01:52.450> if

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
it into your modern-day computer well if

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.160 
it into your modern-day computer well if
you<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> computer<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.130> has<00:01:54.190> ps2<00:01:55.170> this

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
you have a computer that has ps2 this

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.240 
you have a computer that has ps2 this
will<00:01:56.290> just<00:01:56.440> plug<00:01:56.620> right<00:01:56.770> into<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.159> because

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
will just plug right into it because

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.830 
will just plug right into it because
this<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.610> ps2<00:01:57.850> slot<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:58.690> your

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
this is a ps2 slot so if your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.590 
this is a ps2 slot so if your
motherboard<00:01:59.080> accepts<00:01:59.650> ps2<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.210> know<00:02:01.299> Windows

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
motherboard accepts ps2 you know Windows

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.840 
motherboard accepts ps2 you know Windows
the<00:02:01.780> PC<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.560> you're<00:02:03.130> all<00:02:03.220> set<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.580> don't<00:02:03.670> need

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
the PC and you're all set you don't need

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.060 
the PC and you're all set you don't need
an<00:02:03.970> adapter<00:02:04.420> or<00:02:04.450> anything<00:02:04.870> however<00:02:05.650> if<00:02:05.950> you

if I can find one but this particular

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.230 
if I can find one but this particular
adapter<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.350> don't<00:02:14.500> know<00:02:14.590> who<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.800> made<00:02:15.010> by

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
adapter I don't know who it's made by

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.440 
adapter I don't know who it's made by
it's<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.330> USB<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.170> pee

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
it's a USB to pee

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.660 
it's a USB to pee
to<00:02:17.599> adapter<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.739> one<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.040> nice<00:02:19.190> it's

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
to adapter and this one is nice it's

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.759 
to adapter and this one is nice it's
been<00:02:19.819> proven<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.420> blue<00:02:20.780> sort<00:02:21.379> of<00:02:21.470> cube

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
been proven that this blue sort of cube

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.250 
been proven that this blue sort of cube
type<00:02:22.099> adapter<00:02:22.519> works<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.940> best<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.510> for

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
type adapter works the best and for

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.710 
type adapter works the best and for
keyboards<00:02:24.769> because<00:02:25.640> key<00:02:25.910> words<00:02:26.120> kind<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.569> draw

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
keyboards because key words kind of draw

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.710 
keyboards because key words kind of draw
more<00:02:26.900> power<00:02:27.170> than<00:02:27.470> other<00:02:27.650> USB<00:02:28.430> devices<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.180> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
more power than other USB devices so the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.530 
more power than other USB devices so the
way<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.080> works<00:02:30.379> is<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.030> ps2<00:02:32.030> will<00:02:32.239> plug

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
way that this works is the ps2 will plug

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.600 
way that this works is the ps2 will plug
into<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.930> just<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.069> then<00:02:34.430> this

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
into this just like that and then this

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.030 
into this just like that and then this
will<00:02:34.910> plug<00:02:35.239> into<00:02:35.390> your<00:02:35.660> USB<00:02:35.810> whether<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.920> be

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
will plug into your USB whether it be

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.100 
will plug into your USB whether it be
directly<00:02:37.430> into<00:02:37.610> your<00:02:37.730> computer<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.300> could<00:02:39.019> be

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
directly into your computer it could be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.250 
directly into your computer it could be
a<00:02:39.140> Mac<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.739> Windows<00:02:40.010> machine<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.880> Linux<00:02:41.260> can

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
a Mac or a Windows machine or Linux can

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.509 
a Mac or a Windows machine or Linux can
also<00:02:42.380> plug<00:02:42.650> into<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.010> USB<00:02:43.069> hub<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.940> way<00:02:44.380> other

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
also plug into a USB hub that way other

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.520 
also plug into a USB hub that way other
manufacturers<00:02:46.519> have<00:02:46.790> made<00:02:46.819> a<00:02:47.150> key<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.690> cable<00:02:48.170> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
manufacturers have made a key a cable a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.620 
manufacturers have made a key a cable a
cable<00:02:48.769> like<00:02:49.190> this<00:02:49.220> which<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.819> the<00:02:49.910> same<00:02:50.150> kind

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
cable like this which is the same kind

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.660 
cable like this which is the same kind
of<00:02:50.720> cable<00:02:51.049> but<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.709> flat<00:02:51.950> cable<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.519> it's

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
of cable but it's a flat cable and it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.339 
of cable but it's a flat cable and it's
black<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:55.030> hopefully<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
black so hopefully you can see that it's

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.309 
black so hopefully you can see that it's
got<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.950> ps2<00:02:58.430> connector<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.269> one<00:02:59.450> side<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
SDL on the other side so you can search

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.410

original<00:03:14.090> IBM<00:03:14.450> cables<00:03:15.410> came<00:03:15.920> in<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.099> couple<00:03:16.220> of

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
original IBM cables came in a couple of

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.880 
original IBM cables came in a couple of
different<00:03:16.670> lengths<00:03:17.209> some<00:03:18.200> were<00:03:18.319> shorter<00:03:18.709> and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
different lengths some were shorter and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.110 
different lengths some were shorter and
some<00:03:19.040> we're<00:03:19.160> longer<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.519> think<00:03:19.670> they<00:03:19.760> made<00:03:19.910> two

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
some we're longer I think they made two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.479 
some we're longer I think they made two
links<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.510> maybe<00:03:20.630> three<00:03:20.930> lengths<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.489> there

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
links and maybe three lengths and there

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.120 
links and maybe three lengths and there
they<00:03:22.670> all<00:03:22.790> are<00:03:22.819> generally<00:03:23.420> coiled<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.769> it's

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
they all are generally coiled so it's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.710 
they all are generally coiled so it's
just<00:03:25.639> up<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.030> which<00:03:26.180> kind<00:03:26.389> of<00:03:26.450> cable<00:03:26.690> you

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
just up to you which kind of cable you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.110 
just up to you which kind of cable you
prefer<00:03:27.139> oftentimes<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.160> you<00:03:28.280> buy<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.519> model<00:03:28.970> and
