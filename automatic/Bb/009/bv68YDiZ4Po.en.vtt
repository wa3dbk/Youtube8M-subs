00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.060 

not<00:01:54.330> sure<00:01:54.540> about<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> flavor<00:01:55.080> yet<00:01:55.350> we're

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
not sure about the flavor yet we're

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.350 
not sure about the flavor yet we're
going<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.280> look<00:01:56.369> through<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.000> nice<00:01:57.180> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
going to look through it it's nice and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.470 
going to look through it it's nice and
thick<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.440> can<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.940> full<00:01:59.940> cam

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.780 

very<00:02:05.140> thick<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:06.160> it's<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.340> little<00:02:06.580> thicker

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
very thick I think it's a little thicker

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.410 
very thick I think it's a little thicker
than<00:02:07.230> normal<00:02:08.230> pudding<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:10.030> kind<00:02:10.210> of<00:02:10.240> getting

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
than normal pudding it's kind of getting

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.600 
than normal pudding it's kind of getting
stuck<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.840> my<00:02:10.930> teeth<00:02:12.840> Jay<00:02:13.840> don't<00:02:14.050> really<00:02:14.260> like

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
stuck in my teeth Jay don't really like

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.450 
stuck in my teeth Jay don't really like
but<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> flavor<00:02:15.970> isn't<00:02:16.210> bad<00:02:20.190> can't<00:02:21.190> say<00:02:21.340> it's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
but the flavor isn't bad can't say it's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.390 
but the flavor isn't bad can't say it's
amazing<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:23.080> flavor<00:02:23.350> but<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.100> bad<00:02:26.400> but

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
amazing the flavor but it's not bad but

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.950 
amazing the flavor but it's not bad but
you<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.820> grittiness<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.660> protein

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
you have that grittiness of that protein

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.440 
you have that grittiness of that protein
in<00:02:29.260> there<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:33.010> not<00:02:33.160> terrible<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.820> think<00:02:34.330> that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
in there it's not terrible I think that

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.940 
in there it's not terrible I think that
there<00:02:34.570> could<00:02:34.600> be<00:02:34.810> some<00:02:35.110> improvements<00:02:35.620> made<00:02:35.740> on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
there could be some improvements made on

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.030 
there could be some improvements made on
it<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.930> it's<00:02:38.530> completely<00:02:38.950> up

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
but I also would hold off until they

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.300 
but I also would hold off until they
improve<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.080> since<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.740> new<00:02:56.860> product

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310
