in in bringing this to viewers worldwide

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.819 
in in bringing this to viewers worldwide
I<00:03:09.569> think<00:03:09.870> our<00:03:09.989> correspondents<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
I think our correspondents one of the

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.199 
I think our correspondents one of the
things<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.069> correspondents<00:03:11.639> said<00:03:11.819> when

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
things like correspondents said when

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.339 
things like correspondents said when
they<00:03:12.299> got<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.750> ground<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.139> that<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
they got to the ground is that the

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.170 
they got to the ground is that the
camera<00:03:13.590> lens<00:03:13.859> just<00:03:14.010> isn't<00:03:14.579> big<00:03:14.730> enough<00:03:14.849> to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
camera lens just isn't big enough to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.879 
camera lens just isn't big enough to
