to the next generation in titanfall aka
prestiging<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.570> generations<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> pretty<00:00:28.470> much

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
prestiging so generations is pretty much

Titan<00:00:28.980> false<00:00:29.189> prestige<00:00:29.460> mode<00:00:29.880> from<00:00:30.150> call<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
Titan false prestige mode from call that

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.540 
Titan false prestige mode from call that
he<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.019> similar<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.009> lot<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> ways

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
he it's very similar in a lot of ways

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.190 
he it's very similar in a lot of ways
but<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.149> also<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:33.600> different<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> some

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
but it's also pretty different in some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.560 
but it's also pretty different in some
ways<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.710> actually<00:00:35.070> very<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:35.700> very

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
ways and it's actually very very very

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.209 
ways and it's actually very very very
challenging<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> honestly<00:00:37.710> probably<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
challenging and honestly probably a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.350 
challenging and honestly probably a
little<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.579> too<00:00:38.610> challenging<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.210> I'll<00:00:39.270> let

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
little bit too challenging so I'll let

amount of XP generation to 120 percent
generation<00:01:35.430> 330<00:01:36.150> percent<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.659> goes<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's worth it I don't know if I'm
gonna<00:01:59.850> generate<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.240> probably<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> couple

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
gonna generate I probably will a couple

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
gonna generate I probably will a couple
of<00:02:01.049> times<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> experience<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
of times just to experience it but I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.450 
of times just to experience it but I
doubt<00:02:02.850> I'll<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> ten

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
doubt I'll go all the way to ten

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
doubt I'll go all the way to ten
especially<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.479> difficult<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
especially because of how difficult it

is listen to this guy so in order to get
to<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.780> next<00:02:10.050> generation<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.250> too

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
to the next generation we have to do too

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.699 
to the next generation we have to do too
one<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.689> you<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> reach<00:02:13.109> the<00:02:13.290> max<00:02:13.499> level

you earn XP you get 250 we're all used

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.629 
you earn XP you get 250 we're all used
to<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.109> now<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.379> second<00:02:19.859> thing<00:02:19.889> is<00:02:20.189> with

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
to that now the second thing is with

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.339 
to that now the second thing is with
each<00:02:20.879> generation<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:21.870> different

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
each generation there are different

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.319 
each generation there are different
challenges<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.099> you<00:02:23.219> have<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.489> complete<00:02:23.819> to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
challenges that you have to complete to

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.509 
challenges that you have to complete to
get<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.780> next<00:02:24.959> one<00:02:25.079> so<00:02:25.469> from<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.129> from

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
get to the next one so from going from

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.009 
get to the next one so from going from
the<00:02:26.639> first<00:02:26.819> generation<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.629> second

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the first generation to the second

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.179 
the first generation to the second
generation<00:02:28.049> there<00:02:28.469> actually<00:02:28.799> aren't<00:02:28.980> any

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
generation there actually aren't any

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.410 
generation there actually aren't any
challenges<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.879> have<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.299> level

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
challenges you just have to get to level

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
challenges you just have to get to level
50<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.049> one's<00:02:31.230> easy<00:02:31.469> but<00:02:31.980> going<00:02:32.189> from

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
50 so that one's easy but going from

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.009 
50 so that one's easy but going from
second<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.819> third<00:02:32.909> for<00:02:33.269> example<00:02:33.719> what<00:02:33.900> you

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
second to third for example what you

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.420 
second to third for example what you
have<00:02:34.139> to<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.439> be<00:02:34.530> able<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.739> do<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
have to do to be able to do this is you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
have to do to be able to do this is you
have<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.609> get<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.939> max<00:02:36.180> level<00:02:36.389> 50<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.439> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
have to get to max level 50 but then you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.409 
have to get to max level 50 but then you
also<00:02:37.739> have<00:02:37.919> to<00:02:38.040> kill<00:02:38.250> 500<00:02:38.849> enemies<00:02:39.209> with<00:02:39.389> the

ark<00:02:45.930> Rene<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.469> that's<00:02:46.980> not<00:02:47.219> that<00:02:47.280> bad<00:02:47.639> like

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
ark Rene so that's not that bad like

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.099 
ark Rene so that's not that bad like
killing<00:02:48.180> 15<00:02:48.450> days<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.719> the<00:02:48.810> our<00:02:48.870> grenade

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
killing 15 days of the our grenade

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.020 
killing 15 days of the our grenade
that's<00:02:49.409> actually<00:02:49.829> pretty<00:02:50.040> tough<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.699> overall

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's actually pretty tough but overall

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.729 
that's actually pretty tough but overall
you<00:02:51.389> could<00:02:51.599> get<00:02:51.750> those<00:02:51.959> throughout<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.439> life

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you could get those throughout the life

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.439 
you could get those throughout the life
of<00:02:52.919> that<00:02:53.280> generation<00:02:53.669> that<00:02:53.969> wouldn't<00:02:54.239> be<00:02:54.299> too

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
of that generation that wouldn't be too

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.720 
of that generation that wouldn't be too
hard<00:02:54.689> but<00:02:54.959> there<00:02:55.949> are<00:02:56.129> some<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.609> get

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
hard but there are some that get

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.319 
hard but there are some that get
absolutely<00:02:57.540> ridiculous<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.639> but<00:02:59.639> there<00:03:00.150> are

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
absolutely ridiculous like but there are

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.360 
absolutely ridiculous like but there are
some<00:03:00.689> that<00:03:00.810> get<00:03:00.930> absolutely<00:03:01.620> ridiculous<00:03:02.219> so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
some that get absolutely ridiculous so

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.129 
some that get absolutely ridiculous so
check<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.639> out<00:03:02.760> here<00:03:02.969> to<00:03:03.120> go<00:03:03.239> from<00:03:03.419> 5<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.870> 6

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
check this out here to go from 5 to 6

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.379 
check this out here to go from 5 to 6
you<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.739> kill<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> pilot<00:03:05.519> who<00:03:05.699> is<00:03:05.730> ejecting

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
you have to kill a pilot who is ejecting

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.929 
you have to kill a pilot who is ejecting
50<00:03:07.109> times<00:03:07.349> do<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.590> guys<00:03:07.799> know<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.459> how<00:03:08.639> hard

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
50 times do you guys know like how hard

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.729 
50 times do you guys know like how hard
that<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.299> because<00:03:09.659> it's<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.230> something<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
that is because it's not something you

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.319 
that is because it's not something you
can<00:03:10.919> control<00:03:11.129> it's<00:03:11.639> not<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:11.939> you<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.180> make

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
can control it's not like you can make

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.420 
can control it's not like you can make
other<00:03:12.569> pilots<00:03:13.049> eject<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.949> have<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.189> be<00:03:14.310> in

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
other pilots eject you have to be in

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.729 
other pilots eject you have to be in
that<00:03:14.459> situation<00:03:14.900> 50<00:03:15.900> times<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.409> it's<00:03:16.560> just

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
that situation 50 times and it's just

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.050 
that situation 50 times and it's just
totally<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.280> luck<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.579> draw<00:03:17.729> if<00:03:17.939> you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
totally the luck of the draw if you

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.089 
totally the luck of the draw if you
happen<00:03:18.479> to<00:03:18.509> be<00:03:18.599> in<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.079> area<00:03:19.439> at<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.829> point

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
happen to be in that area at that point

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.979 
happen to be in that area at that point
in<00:03:20.189> time<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.849> that's<00:03:21.030> pretty<00:03:21.269> tough<00:03:21.509> going

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
in time so that's pretty tough going

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.110 
in time so that's pretty tough going
from<00:03:22.290> 8<00:03:22.439> to<00:03:22.590> 9<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.459> win<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.729> hundred

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
from 8 to 9 you have to win a hundred

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.670 
from 8 to 9 you have to win a hundred
rounds<00:03:24.269> so<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.569> hundred<00:03:24.959> matches<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:25.439> got<00:03:25.590> to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
rounds so a hundred matches you got to

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.589 
rounds so a hundred matches you got to
win<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.250> lot<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.879> know<00:03:26.909> that<00:03:27.299> one's<00:03:27.479> not

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
win that's a lot you know that one's not

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.509 
win that's a lot you know that one's not
quite<00:03:27.810> as<00:03:28.019> bad<00:03:28.169> as<00:03:28.199> the<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.040> know<00:03:29.129> 50

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
quite as bad as the the you know 50

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.280 
quite as bad as the the you know 50
times<00:03:29.759> ejecting<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:30.389> that's<00:03:30.569> still<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.810> lot<00:03:31.019> to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
times ejecting but that's still a lot to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.520 
times ejecting but that's still a lot to
go<00:03:32.009> from<00:03:32.340> 8<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.669> 9<00:03:32.699> you<00:03:33.329> have<00:03:33.449> to<00:03:33.540> get<00:03:33.659> 50<00:03:34.229> kills

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
go from 8 to 9 you have to get 50 kills

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.599 
go from 8 to 9 you have to get 50 kills
by<00:03:35.400> dropping<00:03:36.120> your<00:03:36.269> Titan<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.129> enemies<00:03:38.129> yes

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
by dropping your Titan on enemies yes

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.460 
by dropping your Titan on enemies yes
that's<00:03:38.939> right<00:03:39.150> when<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:39.689> call<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:40.049> your<00:03:40.139> Titan

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
that's right when you call in your Titan

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.110 
that's right when you call in your Titan
where<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.650> takes<00:03:40.769> like<00:03:41.009> 5<00:03:41.220> seconds<00:03:41.579> you<00:03:42.000> have

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
where it takes like 5 seconds you have

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.030 
where it takes like 5 seconds you have
to<00:03:42.239> kill<00:03:42.419> somebody<00:03:42.659> with<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.049> 50<00:03:43.530> times<00:03:43.769> do

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
to kill somebody with that 50 times do

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.129 
to kill somebody with that 50 times do
you<00:03:44.129> know<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.639> difficult<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.329> is<00:03:45.599> like<00:03:45.780> even

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
you know how difficult that is like even

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.199 
you know how difficult that is like even
if<00:03:46.229> you're<00:03:46.409> aiming<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.370> bots<00:03:47.609> even<00:03:48.120> if

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
if you're aiming for the bots even if

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.309 
if you're aiming for the bots even if
you're<00:03:48.299> aiming<00:03:48.599> for<00:03:48.689> the<00:03:48.780> grunts<00:03:49.139> and<00:03:49.199> the

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
you're aiming for the grunts and the

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.259 
you're aiming for the grunts and the
specters<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.739> stuff<00:03:50.040> those<00:03:50.519> guys<00:03:50.759> still<00:03:51.060> move

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
specters and stuff those guys still move

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.939 
specters and stuff those guys still move
around<00:03:51.479> it's<00:03:51.780> still<00:03:51.959> gonna<00:03:52.229> be<00:03:52.349> tough<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.590> get

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
around it's still gonna be tough to get

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.530 
around it's still gonna be tough to get
those<00:03:53.159> kills<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.639> it's<00:03:53.909> gonna<00:03:54.090> take<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.479> a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
those kills like it's gonna take like a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.420 
those kills like it's gonna take like a
hundred<00:03:54.959> Titan<00:03:55.349> drops<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.219> didn't<00:03:56.370> be

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
hundred Titan drops so you didn't be

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.949 
hundred Titan drops so you didn't be
able<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.639> get<00:03:56.759> close<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.750> probably

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
able to get close to that and probably

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:58.999 
able to get close to that and probably
not<00:03:58.199> even<00:03:58.259> that<00:03:58.439> it's<00:03:58.620> probably<00:03:58.859> gonna<00:03:58.949> be

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
not even that it's probably gonna be

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.259 
not even that it's probably gonna be
more<00:03:59.280> than<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.699> won't<00:03:59.849> get<00:03:59.969> to<00:04:00.030> kill

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
more than that you won't get to kill

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
more than that you won't get to kill
every<00:04:00.599> one<00:04:01.169> into<00:04:01.349> Titan<00:04:01.829> drops<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.189> might<00:04:02.310> take

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
every one into Titan drops it might take

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.369 
every one into Titan drops it might take
two<00:04:02.639> or<00:04:02.669> three<00:04:02.790> hundred<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.689> is<00:04:03.900> absolutely

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
two or three hundred that is absolutely

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.670 
two or three hundred that is absolutely
nuts

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
nuts

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.979 
nuts
now<00:04:05.040> moving<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.790> go<00:04:05.909> from<00:04:06.090> 9<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.359> 10<00:04:06.540> you

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
now moving on to go from 9 to 10 you

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.179 
now moving on to go from 9 to 10 you
have<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.199> kill<00:04:07.400> 1500<00:04:08.400> grunts<00:04:09.019> that<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:10.530> many

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
have to kill 1500 grunts that is so many

never paying attention to grunts I'm

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.569 
never paying attention to grunts I'm
always<00:04:16.049> focusing<00:04:16.530> on<00:04:16.620> other<00:04:16.769> things<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
takes forever to get 50 kills on grunts

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.140 
takes forever to get 50 kills on grunts
to<00:04:19.799> get<00:04:19.919> whatever<00:04:20.099> optic<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.729> need<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.029> that

fifteen hundred that is gonna take so

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.489 
fifteen hundred that is gonna take so
many<00:04:26.090> matches<00:04:26.419> like<00:04:26.810> that's<00:04:26.990> absolutely

00:04:27.489 --> 00:04:27.499 
many matches like that's absolutely

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.469 
many matches like that's absolutely
crazy<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.009> then<00:04:28.400> also<00:04:28.610> go<00:04:28.819> from<00:04:28.999> nine<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.330> ten

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
crazy and then also go from nine to ten

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.600 
crazy and then also go from nine to ten
you<00:04:29.599> get<00:04:29.840> 75<00:04:30.259> kills<00:04:30.710> while<00:04:30.860> ejecting<00:04:31.279> again

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
you get 75 kills while ejecting again

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.219 
you get 75 kills while ejecting again
that's<00:04:32.120> not<00:04:32.330> really<00:04:32.599> something<00:04:32.779> you<00:04:33.050> can

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
that's not really something you can

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.749 
that's not really something you can
control<00:04:33.409> unless<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:34.009> want<00:04:34.159> to<00:04:34.219> earn<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> Titan

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
control unless you want to earn a Titan

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.129 
control unless you want to earn a Titan
and<00:04:34.789> then<00:04:34.939> immediately<00:04:35.150> eject<00:04:35.719> out<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:36.020> it

just to be able to get that one kill

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.119 
just to be able to get that one kill

so<00:04:41.060> yeah<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.779> prestige<00:04:42.139> system<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.770> Titan<00:04:43.520> far

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
so yeah the prestige system in Titan far

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.670 
so yeah the prestige system in Titan far
the<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.449> generation<00:04:45.050> system<00:04:45.409> I<00:04:45.469> guess<00:04:45.590> you

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
the the generation system I guess you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.459 
the the generation system I guess you
call<00:04:45.949> it<00:04:46.009> it's<00:04:46.939> crazy<00:04:47.330> like<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:48.319> very

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
call it it's crazy like it it's very

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.739 
call it it's crazy like it it's very
very<00:04:49.069> difficult<00:04:49.849> and<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.180> woke<00:04:50.509> them

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749 
very difficult and I woke them

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.540 
very difficult and I woke them
difficulty<00:04:51.439> like<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.740> like<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.069> when<00:04:52.400> you've

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
difficulty like I like it when you've

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.309 
difficulty like I like it when you've
got<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.819> earn<00:04:52.999> something<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.659> it<00:04:53.749> you<00:04:53.870> know<00:04:53.960> it

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
got to earn something and it you know it

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.629 
got to earn something and it you know it
took<00:04:54.469> a<00:04:54.620> long<00:04:54.830> time<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.129> get<00:04:55.310> it<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.520> had<00:04:55.610> to

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 
took a long time to get it you had to

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.610 
took a long time to get it you had to
grind<00:04:55.909> it<00:04:56.090> out<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.360> had<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:56.930> know<00:04:57.020> really

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
grind it out you had to you know really

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.860 
grind it out you had to you know really
be<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.770> good<00:04:58.039> player<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.639> use<00:04:59.389> strategy

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
be a good player and and use strategy

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.929 
be a good player and and use strategy
and<00:04:59.990> things<00:05:00.139> like<00:05:00.259> that<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:01.219> this<00:05:01.490> just<00:05:01.759> seems

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
and things like that but this just seems

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:02.980 
and things like that but this just seems
like<00:05:02.029> it's<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.300> little<00:05:02.449> bit<00:05:02.659> too<00:05:02.840> much

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
like it's a little bit too much

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.869 
like it's a little bit too much
especially<00:05:03.319> like<00:05:03.889> that<00:05:04.069> killer<00:05:04.340> pilot<00:05:04.729> who<00:05:04.789> is

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
especially like that killer pilot who is

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.790 
especially like that killer pilot who is
ejecting<00:05:05.330> 50<00:05:05.629> times<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:05.990> can't<00:05:06.289> control<00:05:06.590> that

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
ejecting 50 times you can't control that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.459 
ejecting 50 times you can't control that
at<00:05:06.919> all<00:05:07.099> it's<00:05:07.610> completely<00:05:08.449> just<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.229> luck<00:05:09.379> of

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
at all it's completely just the luck of

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:10.920 
at all it's completely just the luck of
the<00:05:09.529> draw<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:10.009> think<00:05:10.279> that's<00:05:10.430> pretty<00:05:10.610> crazy

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
the draw so I think that's pretty crazy

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.860 
the draw so I think that's pretty crazy
we<00:05:11.930> won't<00:05:12.199> see<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.529> lot<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:13.159> super<00:05:13.610> high<00:05:13.879> you

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
we won't see a lot of super high you

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.689 
we won't see a lot of super high you
know<00:05:14.990> generations<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:16.039> game<00:05:16.250> so<00:05:16.490> if<00:05:16.580> you

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
know generations in this game so if you

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.249 
know generations in this game so if you
can<00:05:16.909> get<00:05:17.150> those<00:05:17.389> things<00:05:17.689> if<00:05:17.839> you<00:05:17.870> can<00:05:18.080> grind

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
can get those things if you can grind

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:19.629 
can get those things if you can grind
that<00:05:18.469> out<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.740> can<00:05:18.770> get<00:05:19.099> up<00:05:19.189> to<00:05:19.219> that<00:05:19.400> tenth

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
that out you can get up to that tenth

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.029 
that out you can get up to that tenth
generation<00:05:19.819> that<00:05:20.719> is<00:05:20.900> truly<00:05:21.319> very<00:05:21.349> impressive

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
generation that is truly very impressive

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.279 
generation that is truly very impressive
so<00:05:22.159> it's<00:05:22.310> kind<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.520> cool<00:05:22.699> it's<00:05:22.759> like<00:05:22.939> a<00:05:23.120> lot<00:05:24.110> of

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
so it's kind of cool it's like a lot of

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.079 
so it's kind of cool it's like a lot of
work<00:05:24.499> but<00:05:25.129> it's<00:05:25.279> also<00:05:25.460> got<00:05:25.639> a<00:05:25.669> pretty<00:05:25.909> cool

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.089 
work but it's also got a pretty cool

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.429 
work but it's also got a pretty cool
reward<00:05:26.419> so<00:05:26.629> I<00:05:26.659> don't<00:05:26.900> know<00:05:26.960> let<00:05:27.199> me<00:05:27.229> know<00:05:27.289> what

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:27.439

goals do you think they should have

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.719 
goals do you think they should have
included<00:05:33.500> challenges<00:05:33.889> but<00:05:34.009> maybe<00:05:34.189> a<00:05:34.310> little

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
included challenges but maybe a little

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.600 
included challenges but maybe a little
bit<00:05:34.909> less<00:05:35.120> typical<00:05:35.689> I<00:05:35.870> don't<00:05:36.379> know<00:05:36.469> I<00:05:36.919> think

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
bit less typical I don't know I think

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.950 
bit less typical I don't know I think
these<00:05:37.849> challenges<00:05:38.300> might<00:05:38.449> be<00:05:38.569> a<00:05:38.599> little<00:05:38.779> bit

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
these challenges might be a little bit

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.260 
these challenges might be a little bit
too<00:05:39.080> hard<00:05:39.319> but<00:05:39.919> but<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.399> don't<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.699> just<00:05:40.819> I<00:05:40.939> feel

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
too hard but but I don't I just I feel

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.550 
too hard but but I don't I just I feel
like<00:05:41.360> they<00:05:41.479> should<00:05:41.509> be<00:05:41.719> totally<00:05:42.020> in<00:05:42.169> control

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
like they should be totally in control

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.019 
like they should be totally in control
of<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.979> player<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.580> it<00:05:43.639> shouldn't<00:05:43.939> be

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
of the player and it shouldn't be

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.850 
of the player and it shouldn't be
totally<00:05:44.419> up<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.659> chance<00:05:44.899> on<00:05:45.199> some<00:05:45.649> of<00:05:45.770> these

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
totally up to chance on some of these

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.860 
totally up to chance on some of these
things<00:05:46.069> but<00:05:46.339> some<00:05:46.580> yeah<00:05:47.389> those<00:05:47.599> are<00:05:47.750> pretty

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
things but some yeah those are pretty

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.600 
things but some yeah those are pretty
crazy<00:05:48.080> and<00:05:48.229> then<00:05:48.319> keep<00:05:48.469> in<00:05:48.589> mind<00:05:48.770> on<00:05:48.949> top<00:05:49.460> of

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
crazy and then keep in mind on top of

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.920 
crazy and then keep in mind on top of
those<00:05:49.759> challenges<00:05:50.149> that<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:50.330> just<00:05:50.539> mentioned

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
those challenges that I just mentioned

like the the 8 to 9 get 50 kills by

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.429 
like the the 8 to 9 get 50 kills by
dropping<00:05:53.210> your<00:05:53.270> Titan<00:05:53.539> on<00:05:53.629> enemies<00:05:53.930> that's

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
dropping your Titan on enemies that's

dropping your Titan on enemies that's
only<00:05:54.680> one<00:05:54.949> of<00:05:54.979> like<00:05:55.189> 5<00:05:55.430> challenges<00:05:56.029> to<00:05:56.180> get

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
you plan on going to a two-generation of

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.100 
you plan on going to a two-generation of
ten<00:06:10.550> in<00:06:10.729> this<00:06:10.879> game<00:06:11.149> now<00:06:11.300> finally<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.080> last

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
ten in this game now finally the last

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.230 
ten in this game now finally the last
thing<00:06:12.319> I'll<00:06:12.500> let<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.680> guys<00:06:12.800> know<00:06:12.830> about<00:06:13.029> is<00:06:14.029> in

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
thing I'll let you guys know about is in

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.089 
thing I'll let you guys know about is in
terms<00:06:14.479> of<00:06:14.629> like<00:06:14.750> levels<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.349> XP<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:15.860> stuff

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
terms of like levels and XP and stuff

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.769 
terms of like levels and XP and stuff
like<00:06:16.219> that<00:06:16.399> you<00:06:16.580> guys<00:06:16.729> know<00:06:17.000> as<00:06:17.180> you<00:06:17.629> get

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
like that you guys know as you get

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.300 
like that you guys know as you get
higher<00:06:17.990> up<00:06:18.050> in<00:06:18.349> levels<00:06:18.649> it<00:06:18.770> becomes<00:06:19.069> more

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
higher up in levels it becomes more

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.070 
higher up in levels it becomes more
difficult<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:19.849> you<00:06:20.330> know<00:06:20.449> move<00:06:20.659> on<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:21.020> the

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
difficult to you know move on to the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.110 
difficult to you know move on to the
next<00:06:21.319> level<00:06:21.529> it<00:06:21.589> requires<00:06:21.680> more<00:06:22.219> XP<00:06:22.639> each<00:06:22.819> time

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
next level it requires more XP each time

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.749 
next level it requires more XP each time
so<00:06:23.599> it<00:06:23.719> looks<00:06:23.990> like<00:06:24.110> around<00:06:24.710> level<00:06:24.860> 40<00:06:25.279> or<00:06:25.399> 41

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
so it looks like around level 40 or 41

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.820 
so it looks like around level 40 or 41
is<00:06:26.089> the<00:06:26.270> midway<00:06:26.599> point<00:06:26.870> for<00:06:27.080> XP<00:06:27.409> so<00:06:27.589> the<00:06:27.680> last

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
is the midway point for XP so the last

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.219 
is the midway point for XP so the last
like<00:06:28.039> 9<00:06:28.310> levels<00:06:28.849> is<00:06:29.029> equivalent<00:06:29.810> to<00:06:29.870> the<00:06:30.020> first

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
like 9 levels is equivalent to the first

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.170 
like 9 levels is equivalent to the first
40<00:06:30.709> so<00:06:30.949> just<00:06:31.129> keep<00:06:31.279> that<00:06:31.310> in<00:06:31.459> mind<00:06:31.699> I<00:06:31.789> get<00:06:31.940> first

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
40 so just keep that in mind I get first

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.059 
40 so just keep that in mind I get first
you<00:06:32.690> up<00:06:32.839> on<00:06:32.990> titanfall<00:06:33.349> and<00:06:33.620> I'm<00:06:33.709> running

you up on titanfall and I'm running
through<00:06:34.370> this<00:06:34.490> thing

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
through this thing

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.910 
through this thing
like<00:06:34.940> already<00:06:35.120> 27<00:06:35.960> or<00:06:36.050> whatever<00:06:36.320> it<00:06:36.440> is<00:06:36.530> and

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
like already 27 or whatever it is and

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.950 
like already 27 or whatever it is and
I'm<00:06:37.070> like<00:06:37.220> wow<00:06:37.430> I'm<00:06:37.760> flying<00:06:38.210> for<00:06:38.540> these<00:06:38.660> levels

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
I'm like wow I'm flying for these levels

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.870 
I'm like wow I'm flying for these levels
no<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.830> aren't<00:06:40.040> really<00:06:40.190> like<00:06:40.400> I'm<00:06:40.550> not<00:06:40.670> even

halfway yet so that is pretty crazy to

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.890 
halfway yet so that is pretty crazy to
think<00:06:43.790> about<00:06:43.910> so<00:06:44.180> yeah<00:06:44.300> just<00:06:44.540> keep<00:06:44.660> that<00:06:44.780> in
