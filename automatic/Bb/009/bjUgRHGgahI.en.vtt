so<00:00:14.430> we've<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:14.640> finished<00:00:14.910> riding<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so we've just finished riding in the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.310 
so we've just finished riding in the
Northeast<00:00:16.710> Alps<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.700> last<00:00:17.850> few<00:00:18.090> days

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
Northeast Alps for the last few days

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.260 
Northeast Alps for the last few days
I've<00:00:19.320> been<00:00:19.380> lucky<00:00:19.650> enough<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.980> wear<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> couple

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
I've been lucky enough to wear a couple

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.940 
I've been lucky enough to wear a couple
of<00:00:21.420> laser<00:00:21.599> helmets<00:00:22.110> over<00:00:22.290> the<00:00:22.410> last<00:00:22.560> few<00:00:22.800> days

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
of laser helmets over the last few days

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.400 
of laser helmets over the last few days
we<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.849> Genesis<00:00:24.360> life<00:00:24.720> being<00:00:24.990> helmet

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
we have the Genesis life being helmet

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.890 
we have the Genesis life being helmet
here<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.730> Zed<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.480> I'll<00:00:27.660> talk<00:00:27.869> about

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
here and the Zed one so I'll talk about

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.439 
here and the Zed one so I'll talk about
each<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.560> these<00:00:28.710> they're<00:00:29.550> very<00:00:29.789> different<00:00:30.090> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
each of these they're very different in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.049 
each of these they're very different in
their<00:00:30.690> I<00:00:31.140> suppose<00:00:31.590> approach<00:00:32.010> and<00:00:32.970> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
their I suppose approach and the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.520 
their I suppose approach and the
functionality<00:00:33.449> of<00:00:33.720> each<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.170> let's<00:00:34.410> go

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
functionality of each so let's go

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
functionality of each so let's go
through<00:00:34.739> these<00:00:34.920> two<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:35.760> Genesis

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
through these two here is the Genesis

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
through these two here is the Genesis
life<00:00:36.870> beam<00:00:37.199> some<00:00:37.949> amazing<00:00:38.370> technology<00:00:38.940> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
life beam some amazing technology in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
life beam some amazing technology in
this<00:00:39.300> we've<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:40.199> a<00:00:40.559> sensor<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.220> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this we've actually got a sensor at the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
this we've actually got a sensor at the
front<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.580> the<00:00:41.670> helmet<00:00:41.970> which<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.330> see<00:00:42.540> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
front of the helmet which you can see so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.439 
front of the helmet which you can see so
this<00:00:43.530> replaces<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.160> heart<00:00:44.790> rate<00:00:44.970> strap

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
this replaces the heart rate strap

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.209 
this replaces the heart rate strap
so<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> pairs<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.320> any<00:00:46.440> computer<00:00:46.800> polo

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so this pairs with any computer polo

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
so this pairs with any computer polo
Garmin<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.960> takes<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.380> heart

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
Garmin and actually takes your heart

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
Garmin and actually takes your heart
rate<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.399> forehead<00:00:50.640> which<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> quite

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
rate from your forehead which is quite

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
rate from your forehead which is quite
amazing<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.950> I<00:00:52.980> said<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> means<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
amazing so like I said it means you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.560 
amazing so like I said it means you
don't<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> heart<00:00:54.059> rate<00:00:54.239> strap<00:00:54.420> around

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
don't have the heart rate strap around

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.990 
don't have the heart rate strap around
the<00:00:54.780> chest<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> breathe<00:00:55.590> easy<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:56.850> won't

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the chest you can breathe easy you won't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
the chest you can breathe easy you won't
have<00:00:57.120> any<00:00:57.300> chafing<00:00:57.540> rubbing<00:00:58.170> anything<00:00:58.320> like

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
have any chafing rubbing anything like

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.220 
have any chafing rubbing anything like
that<00:00:59.329> having<00:01:00.329> worn<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> couple<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that having worn this for a couple of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
that having worn this for a couple of
days<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:01.950> notice<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> once

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
days you really don't notice it once

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.639 
days you really don't notice it once
it's<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.020> it's<00:01:04.020> just<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.259> matter<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.500> getting

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
it's on it's just a matter of getting

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's on it's just a matter of getting
the<00:01:04.890> sizing<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.759> helmet<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.180> then

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the sizing right for the helmet and then

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
the sizing right for the helmet and then
you're<00:01:06.420> good<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:06.660> go<00:01:06.690> as<00:01:07.410> far<00:01:07.649> as<00:01:07.770> pairing<00:01:08.160> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you're good to go as far as pairing it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.249 
you're good to go as far as pairing it
to<00:01:08.399> your<00:01:08.520> computer<00:01:08.910> goes<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.450> took<00:01:09.660> us<00:01:09.780> 30

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
to your computer goes it took us 30

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.050 
to your computer goes it took us 30
seconds<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.009> was<00:01:11.130> no<00:01:11.310> issue<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.910> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
seconds it was no issue at all is really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
seconds it was no issue at all is really
simple<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:14.039> thing<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
simple to do the only thing you need to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.609 
simple to do the only thing you need to
be<00:01:14.580> mindful<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.360> turning<00:01:15.899> on<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.380> at

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
be mindful of is turning on on the on at

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.500 
be mindful of is turning on on the on at
the<00:01:16.680> back<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.000> started<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
the back so we actually started the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.450 
the back so we actually started the
climb<00:01:18.720> wondering<00:01:19.650> why<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.770> wasn't<00:01:19.950> working

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
climb wondering why it wasn't working

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.920 
climb wondering why it wasn't working
sure<00:01:20.729> enough<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.479> switch<00:01:21.659> as

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
sure enough it's just the on switch as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
sure enough it's just the on switch as
it<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.320> most<00:01:22.530> occasions<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> helmet<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it is on most occasions the helmet is a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
it is on most occasions the helmet is a
little<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.530> heavier<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.520> shy<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
little bit heavier so it's just shy of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.810 
little bit heavier so it's just shy of
400<00:01:27.869> grams<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.439> quite<00:01:28.770> heavy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
400 grams which is quite heavy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.200 
400 grams which is quite heavy
but<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.540> anything<00:01:30.960> new<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> tend<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
but as with anything new you tend to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.300 
but as with anything new you tend to
find<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:33.780> floors<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.590> over<00:01:34.860> time<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
find these floors and then over time it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
find these floors and then over time it
starts<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:35.909> better<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> better<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
starts to get better and better and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.749 
starts to get better and better and
better<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:37.799> sure<00:01:38.009> each<00:01:38.220> model<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.610> get

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
better so I'm sure each model will get

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.420 
better so I'm sure each model will get
lighter<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> lighter<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> won't<00:01:41.280> have

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
lighter and lighter and you won't have

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.340 
lighter and lighter and you won't have
those<00:01:41.580> issues<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.450> technology<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.200> actually

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
those issues the technology is actually

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.960 
those issues the technology is actually
from<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> military<00:01:44.250> background<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.939> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
from a military background where they

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
from a military background where they
wanted<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> measure<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.229> heart<00:01:46.439> rate<00:01:46.650> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
wanted to measure the heart rate and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.569 
wanted to measure the heart rate and
stress<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:48.049> paratroopers<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
stress on paratroopers so that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.210 
stress on paratroopers so that
technology<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.869> far<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.290> bike<00:01:52.500> helmets<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
technology as far as bike helmets go and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.740 
technology as far as bike helmets go and
in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> cycling<00:01:53.759> world<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> completely

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
in the cycling world is completely

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
in the cycling world is completely
revolutionary<00:01:55.380> we'll<00:01:55.979> talk<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> Zed

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
revolutionary we'll talk about the Zed

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
revolutionary we'll talk about the Zed
one<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.060> second<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.479> their<00:01:57.600> plan<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
one in a second and their plan is to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.840 
one in a second and their plan is to
integrate<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.740> technology<00:01:59.009> into<00:01:59.700> those

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
integrate this technology into those

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
integrate this technology into those
helmets<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.409> I'll<00:02:01.590> talk<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
helmets which as I'll talk about is a

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.270 
helmets which as I'll talk about is a
lighter<00:02:02.899> more<00:02:03.899> race<00:02:04.200> orientated<00:02:04.890> version<00:02:05.189> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
lighter more race orientated version of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.460 
lighter more race orientated version of
this<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.450> we<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> laser<00:02:06.990> Zed

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
this one so here we have the laser Zed

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.669 
this one so here we have the laser Zed
one<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.000> their<00:02:09.269> race<00:02:10.019> helmet<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.530> this

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
one so this is their race helmet so this

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.130 
one so this is their race helmet so this
is<00:02:10.829> for<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.070> serious<00:02:11.489> guys<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:12.900> every

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
is for the serious guys that want every

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.080 
is for the serious guys that want every
advantage<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.190> start<00:02:14.549> with<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:14.850> helmet

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
advantage so to start with this helmet

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.880 
advantage so to start with this helmet
is<00:02:15.269> really<00:02:15.540> light<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> large<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.799> it's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
is really light this is a large and it's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.850 
is really light this is a large and it's
270<00:02:17.519> grams<00:02:18.170> once<00:02:19.170> you've<00:02:19.320> got<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
270 grams once you've got it on you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
270 grams once you've got it on you
barely<00:02:20.100> notice<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.730> I've<00:02:21.060> spent<00:02:21.450> quite<00:02:21.629> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
barely notice it so I've spent quite a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.890 
barely notice it so I've spent quite a
few<00:02:21.780> hours<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.379> this<00:02:23.629> climbing<00:02:24.629> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
few hours with this climbing in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
few hours with this climbing in
different<00:02:25.379> weather<00:02:25.500> climates

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
different weather climates

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.530 
different weather climates
and<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:27.250> really<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.850> don't<00:02:27.970> notice<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.360> once

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and it's really you don't notice it once

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.790 
and it's really you don't notice it once
it's<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.780> there<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.050> actually<00:02:29.200> went<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> get

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
it's on there I actually went to get

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's on there I actually went to get
some<00:02:30.040> photos<00:02:30.340> taken<00:02:30.460> with<00:02:30.610> some<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.030> other

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
some photos taken with some of the other

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.450 
some photos taken with some of the other
guys<00:02:31.300> riding<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.830> left<00:02:33.100> my<00:02:33.190> helmet<00:02:33.430> on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
guys riding and left my helmet on

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.650 
guys riding and left my helmet on
because<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.730> didn't<00:02:33.880> even<00:02:34.000> realize<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.420> had<00:02:34.450> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
because I didn't even realize I had it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.460 
because I didn't even realize I had it
on<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.020> very<00:02:35.290> comfortable<00:02:35.800> very<00:02:36.370> light<00:02:37.170> as<00:02:38.170> far

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
on so very comfortable very light as far

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.010 
on so very comfortable very light as far
as<00:02:38.590> feeding<00:02:38.800> goes<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.250> got<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> nice<00:02:39.550> erm<00:02:40.210> ARS

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
as feeding goes it's got a nice erm ARS

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.930 
as feeding goes it's got a nice erm ARS
system<00:02:41.410> at<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.620> top<00:02:41.800> here<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.250> as<00:02:42.700> soon<00:02:42.850> as

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
system at the top here so as soon as

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.400 
system at the top here so as soon as
you've<00:02:43.060> got<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.300> on<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.570> can<00:02:43.750> just<00:02:43.960> turn<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.260> in

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
you've got it on you can just turn it in

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.080 
you've got it on you can just turn it in
and<00:02:44.590> out<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.920> tighten<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.550> loosen<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.970> it's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and out to tighten it or loosen it it's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.180 
and out to tighten it or loosen it it's
really<00:02:46.270> nice<00:02:46.420> as<00:02:47.290> far<00:02:47.560> as<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.770> fit<00:02:47.950> goes

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
really nice as far as the fit goes

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.860 
really nice as far as the fit goes
between<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.850> two<00:02:49.000> helmets<00:02:49.240> it's<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.660> little

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
between the two helmets it's a little

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.230 
between the two helmets it's a little
bit<00:02:49.960> different<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.490> large<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:52.060> well

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
bit different so this is a large as well

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.880 
bit different so this is a large as well
but<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:52.480> found<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
but I found this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.620 
but I found this
I<00:02:53.920> had<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.459> tighten<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:54.850> quite<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> bit<00:02:55.270> in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
I had to tighten this quite a bit in

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.960 
I had to tighten this quite a bit in
comparison<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.770> life<00:02:56.950> beam<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.760> maybe

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
comparison to the life beam so maybe

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
comparison to the life beam so maybe
just<00:02:58.209> be<00:02:58.330> aware<00:02:58.630> as<00:02:59.350> far<00:02:59.620> as<00:02:59.709> your<00:02:59.800> sizing<00:03:00.190> goes

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
just be aware as far as your sizing goes

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.980 
just be aware as far as your sizing goes
to<00:03:00.610> be<00:03:00.700> really<00:03:00.910> helpful<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.270> try<00:03:01.450> these<00:03:01.570> on<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
to be really helpful to try these on and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.930 
to be really helpful to try these on and
see<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.290> works<00:03:02.530> for<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.280> dare<00:03:03.640> say<00:03:03.670> I'd

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
see what works for you so I dare say I'd

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.360 
see what works for you so I dare say I'd
be<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.090> medium<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.830> then

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
be a medium in this one and then

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.670 
be a medium in this one and then
potentially<00:03:06.910> go<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.450> size<00:03:07.959> with<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> life

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
potentially go up a size with the life

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.229 
potentially go up a size with the life
theme<00:03:08.980> simply<00:03:09.489> because<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> sensor

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
theme simply because of the sensor

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.270 
theme simply because of the sensor
that's<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.540> there<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:11.590> couple<00:03:11.709> of<00:03:12.130> features

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
that's in there a couple of features

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
that's in there a couple of features
about<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.850> helmet<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.720> there's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
about this helmet as you can see there's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.600 
about this helmet as you can see there's
a<00:03:13.959> bit<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.230> shell<00:03:14.530> over<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:15.010> top<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:15.430> so

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
a bit of a shell over the top here so

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.690 
a bit of a shell over the top here so
this<00:03:16.120> has<00:03:16.300> two<00:03:16.510> functions<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:17.410> insulates<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
this has two functions it insulates the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.699 
this has two functions it insulates the
helmet<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.660> makes<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.959> little<00:03:20.080> bit<00:03:20.200> warmer

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
helmet so it makes a little bit warmer

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.920
