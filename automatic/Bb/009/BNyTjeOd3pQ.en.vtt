working what else can he do I one thing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.289 
working what else can he do I one thing
is<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:22.820> takes<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.090> e2<00:01:25.610> but<00:01:26.610> compared<00:01:27.150> to

is that he takes on e2 but compared to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
is that he takes on e2 but compared to
his<00:01:27.509> background<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.130> mA

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
his background here we have one mA

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
his background here we have one mA
defender<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> knight<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.630> f3<00:01:30.810> which

defender we have a knight on f3 which

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
defender we have a knight on f3 which
means<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.009> white<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.729> barely<00:01:33.090> take<00:01:33.270> the

Queen<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> end<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.460> good

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
Queen and at the end that's a very good

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.359 
Queen and at the end that's a very good
trait<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> pieces<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> Queen<00:01:37.920> Farooq

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
trait of pieces of Queen Farooq

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
trait of pieces of Queen Farooq
definitely<00:01:38.909> white<00:01:39.060> escape<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.659> he<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.990> going

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
definitely white escape in he is going

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.270 
definitely white escape in he is going
to<00:01:40.409> win<00:01:40.640> which<00:01:41.640> leaves<00:01:42.180> us<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.659> only<00:01:43.280> two

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
to win which leaves us with only two

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950 
to win which leaves us with only two
moves<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.790> defending<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> back<00:01:45.659> rank

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
moves that are defending the back rank

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.069 
moves that are defending the back rank
one<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.409> Quinn<00:01:46.710> d8<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.909> okay<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
one is Quinn d8 what okay then the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.740 
one is Quinn d8 what okay then the
simplest<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> white<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.329> yet

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
simplest is that white can take on yet

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
simplest is that white can take on yet
and<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.320> gaining<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.890> Queen<00:01:53.100> anyways

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and he is gaining the Queen anyways

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
and he is gaining the Queen anyways
although<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> even<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> better<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
although there is even a better way to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
although there is even a better way to
win<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> game<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.700> Queen<00:01:57.240> text<00:01:57.540> yet<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
win the game with Queen text yet and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.870 
win the game with Queen text yet and
there<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.229> no<00:01:58.380> sufficient<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:59.219> defense<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there is no sufficient in defense on the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.830 
there is no sufficient in defense on the
background<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:02.210> finally<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> move<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> was

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
background and finally the move that was

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
background and finally the move that was
played<00:02:04.079> into<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> game<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> move

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
played into the game this is the move

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.050 
played into the game this is the move
Queen<00:02:05.700> B<00:02:05.969> 5<00:02:07.670> now<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.970> seems<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.560> black<00:02:10.560> is
