most<00:02:31.700> people<00:02:32.000> aren't<00:02:32.360> very<00:02:33.190> very<00:02:34.270> pleased<00:02:35.270> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
most people aren't very very pleased the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.170 
most people aren't very very pleased the
way<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.810> May<00:02:35.990> because<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:37.460> Constructicons

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
way it's May because the Constructicons

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.460 
way it's May because the Constructicons
themselves<00:02:38.690> don't<00:02:38.780> transform<00:02:39.290> into

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
themselves don't transform into

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.280 
themselves don't transform into
individual<00:02:40.100> robots<00:02:40.280> which<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.300> kind<00:02:42.230> of

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
individual robots which is kind of

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.610 
individual robots which is kind of
annoying<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:43.630> mean<00:02:44.630> they<00:02:45.200> could<00:02:45.380> have<00:02:45.410> done<00:02:45.560> a

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
annoying I mean they could have done a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.220 
annoying I mean they could have done a
better<00:02:45.890> job<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:50.830> well<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.020> all<00:02:54.170> I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
better job on that so well this is all I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.400 
better job on that so well this is all I
can<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:54.680> them<00:02:55.010> for<00:02:55.220> now

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.550 

I<00:03:01.440> didn't<00:03:02.250> want<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.690> saw<00:03:03.690> anything<00:03:03.990> or<00:03:04.260> drill

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I didn't want to saw anything or drill

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.850 
I didn't want to saw anything or drill
anything<00:03:05.100> or<00:03:05.460> change<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:07.080> structures<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
anything or change the structures of the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.700 
anything or change the structures of the
movies<00:03:08.580> toy<00:03:08.850> because<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.380> keep<00:03:10.530> them

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
movies toy because I like to keep them

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.590 
movies toy because I like to keep them
in<00:03:10.770> great<00:03:10.980> condition<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.640> didn't<00:03:12.330> know<00:03:12.390> more

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
in great condition I didn't know more

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.020 
in great condition I didn't know more
people<00:03:12.870> will<00:03:12.990> customize<00:03:13.380> them<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.130> take<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
people will customize them I take it

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.110 
people will customize them I take it
apart<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.010> on

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
apart and so on

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.470 
apart and so on
seeing<00:03:18.840> paper<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:21.000> extra<00:03:21.450> things

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
seeing paper and it's some extra things

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.370 
seeing paper and it's some extra things
and<00:03:23.180> such<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.360> such<00:03:24.510> but<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:26.270> think<00:03:27.270> it's<00:03:27.420> this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
and such and such but I think it's this

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.310 
and such and such but I think it's this
is<00:03:28.530> close<00:03:28.740> enough<00:03:28.920> as<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.390> mean<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
is close enough as it is I mean it's the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.180 
is close enough as it is I mean it's the
best<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.710> can<00:03:31.770> do<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.310> far<00:03:33.920> doesn't<00:03:34.920> look<00:03:35.160> that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
best I can do so far doesn't look that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
best I can do so far doesn't look that
bad<00:03:35.610> but<00:03:35.640> he's<00:03:36.210> really<00:03:36.900> flimsy<00:03:38.930> especially

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
bad but he's really flimsy especially

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.920 
bad but he's really flimsy especially
when<00:03:40.020> picking<00:03:40.260> him<00:03:40.380> up<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.770> mean<00:03:41.720> Mix<00:03:42.720> Master

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
when picking him up I mean Mix Master

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.050 
when picking him up I mean Mix Master
and<00:03:43.380> Sumatra<00:03:44.220> don't<00:03:44.430> really<00:03:44.670> stay<00:03:44.880> together

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
and Sumatra don't really stay together

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.759 
and Sumatra don't really stay together
very<00:03:45.960> tightly<00:03:46.050> they<00:03:46.860> don't<00:03:47.930> write

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.149 

doesn't<00:03:52.430> look<00:03:52.519> too<00:03:52.579> bad<00:03:53.500> it's<00:03:54.500> only<00:03:54.680> if<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.040> was

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
doesn't look too bad it's only if it was

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.500
