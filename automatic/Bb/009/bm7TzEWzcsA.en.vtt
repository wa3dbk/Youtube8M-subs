forward<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.949> back<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.789> going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> make<00:04:21.239> it

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
forward and back that's going to make it

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.300 
forward and back that's going to make it
a<00:04:21.449> little<00:04:21.630> bit<00:04:21.870> difficult<00:04:22.079> remember<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.949> when

together<00:05:20.940> yourself<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:22.020> then<00:05:22.979> we're<00:05:23.130> going

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
together yourself and then we're going

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:33.230 
together yourself and then we're going
to<00:05:23.280> come<00:05:23.520> back<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:24.060> our<00:05:24.090> next<00:05:24.570> movement

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.030 

ok<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.300> now<00:05:34.690> we're<00:05:34.870> going<00:05:34.900> forward<00:05:35.590> back<00:05:35.800> in

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
ok so now we're going forward back in

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.370 
ok so now we're going forward back in
side<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.580> side<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.270> so<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:37.780> don't<00:05:38.050> have<00:05:38.200> to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
side to side and so you don't have to

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.440 
side to side and so you don't have to
look<00:05:38.560> at<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.860> same<00:05:39.190> wall<00:05:39.550> all<00:05:39.970> night<00:05:40.240> long

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
look at the same wall all night long

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.690 
look at the same wall all night long
while<00:05:40.690> you're<00:05:40.840> dancing<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.770> want<00:05:42.010> to<00:05:42.130> rotate

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
while you're dancing you want to rotate

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.450 
while you're dancing you want to rotate
that<00:05:42.970> basic<00:05:43.540> step<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.560> we're<00:05:44.980> going<00:05:45.100> to<00:05:45.190> rotate

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
that basic step so we're going to rotate

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.510 
that basic step so we're going to rotate
this<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.000> our<00:05:46.510> left<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.470> what's<00:05:48.250> going<00:05:48.460> to

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
this to our left and what's going to

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.700 
this to our left and what's going to
happen<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:49.210> as<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:49.510> do<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.110> step<00:05:50.440> you're

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
happen is as you do that step you're

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.260 
happen is as you do that step you're
going<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.950> do<00:05:51.220> it<00:05:51.400> but<00:05:51.580> you're<00:05:51.700> gonna<00:05:51.790> rotate

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
going to do it but you're gonna rotate

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.090 
going to do it but you're gonna rotate
your<00:05:52.630> basic<00:05:53.140> so<00:05:53.350> I'm<00:05:53.590> going<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.920> demonstrate

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
your basic so I'm going to demonstrate

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.130 
your basic so I'm going to demonstrate
this<00:05:54.610> really<00:05:54.940> quick<00:05:55.150> just<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.570> see<00:05:55.660> how<00:05:55.990> it

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
this really quick just so you see how it

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.680 
this really quick just so you see how it
goes<00:05:56.320> I'm<00:05:56.650> going<00:05:57.250> to<00:05:57.310> turn<00:05:57.640> my<00:05:57.910> left<00:05:58.270> toe

right<00:06:18.640> so<00:06:19.240> you<00:06:19.300> see<00:06:19.660> I<00:06:19.690> was<00:06:19.990> able<00:06:20.170> to<00:06:20.320> make<00:06:20.680> a

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
right so you see I was able to make a

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.890 
right so you see I was able to make a
circle<00:06:21.400> if<00:06:21.610> I<00:06:21.730> had<00:06:21.910> my<00:06:22.060> partner<00:06:22.270> with<00:06:22.600> me<00:06:22.750> we
