00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.819
 the other day that this is a shop 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.880
 there were beautiful necklaces made 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.219
 of cloth that however cost 200 euros and 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.950
 I thought why never buy them when 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.200

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.580

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.570

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.500
 cotton 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.570
 here is to cut the shirt so 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.250
 solid and therefore type begins to cut 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.170
 to storm this shirt 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.450
 meanwhile we can use like 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.309
 our necklace decoration 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.170
 love bari style i took in 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.670

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.559
 cipollini explain absolutely one 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.680
 cargo land then go on like this 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:51.789
 to infinity of the market aims selective costs 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.559
 maximum concepts and I must mark you fields 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:01:00.680
 knowledge buoys you have rostok hamas that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.050
 then you can for example make a way to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.390
 one end in the necklace to create 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.860
 already a myth I 've done this very interesting 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.700
 and repairing this tutorial hopes so many 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.930
 that it makes no sense to end up a wet nurse 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.189
 this always performs a lot of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.829
 our goat we can insert some 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:32.130
