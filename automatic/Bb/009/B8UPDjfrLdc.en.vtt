 At first it did not look so bad but Luca Toni could not continue 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.630
 the exact examination 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.780
 almost like a Schweinsteiger 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.369
 Over three months he could not play for FC Stahl 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.650

 Pentecost is ranked fifth 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.219

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 with the IOC to zero also a great hit 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.589
 After all, it's fun to watch Bavaria as the whole thing 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.049
 tropical temperatures though 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.299
 Bayern would not continue to put pressure on further goals 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.299
 achieve as here the 9 2 million 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.989
 Erwin team will be so 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.169
 with his life 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.289

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.379
 bavarian wide are in action mood great action by Bastian Schweinsteiger 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.619
 grandiose 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.619
 30 meters at it for information 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.749
 the switches are 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.779
 Shot to the target to zero 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.779
 Bastian Schweinsteiger in the 78th 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.710
 Minutes later, the next opportunity 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.750
 Sandro Wagner gives Mats Hummels the first time 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.399
 Tino l 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.199
 also the boy play so much fear in the first half in the 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 Central defense in the second 45 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.919
 87 minutes 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.959
 he should 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.149
 on the Telestar 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.429
 for the blue ones 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.869
 but who exactly removed 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.869
 Her focus must be on the first dance of her mountain tour 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.499
 Hit the 5 cents though follows 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.349
 came in KÃ¶then on the hosts to their possibilities i10 Shosholoza 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.159
 amount itself 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.939
 and the spoilsport Michael Denzin with a splendid parade 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:34.210
 the Briton 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.319
 then in the same minute of play 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.140
 the last goal for Bayern Munich 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.660

 13 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:53.740
 maybe the lucky number for Bayern Munich the same result 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.150
 Nobody in Buchenau 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.870
 The free kick of Bastian Schweinsteiger's last action in this game 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.699
 Starting signal for the Bavarians 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.520
 to leave the field 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.869
 to cool off in the cabin for the statements after the game 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.360
 but never before had it made sense to be dark 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.130
 Affliction begins so that's the first to hear that the second round 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.499
 Round all around probably to end 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:24.069
 so far as in the old stitches just against a bit tired 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.599
 has been 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.650
 but not so priestly 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.319
 played out and 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.150
 It's your turn 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.150

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.909
 the city starts again
