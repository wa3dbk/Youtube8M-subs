plastic pen um I wouldn't use a metal
like<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.780> they're<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.110> pour<00:00:34.739> spray

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like one because they're not pour spray

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.780 
like one because they're not pour spray
just<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.760> yarn<00:00:37.219> but<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> could

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
just have some yarn but then you could

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.319 
just have some yarn but then you could
also<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.360> double-sided<00:00:40.070> tape<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> glue

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
also use double-sided tape with the glue

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.770 
also use double-sided tape with the glue
you<00:00:43.640> want<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.850> careful<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> put<00:00:45.750> too

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you want to be careful not to put too

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.610 
you want to be careful not to put too
much<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:47.510> because<00:00:48.510> it'll<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> clump

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
much on because it'll kind of clump

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.570 
much on because it'll kind of clump
between<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.030> thread

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.260 

so<00:01:00.240> you<00:01:00.360> can<00:01:00.480> either<00:01:00.630> have<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.270> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so you can either have it like this and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
so you can either have it like this and
you<00:01:03.360> put<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.720> on<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.770> you<00:01:04.949> wrap<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you put it on and then as you wrap you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.800 
you put it on and then as you wrap you
wrap<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.450> tail<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:08.660> you<00:01:09.660> can

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
wrap this little tail end or you can

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.550 
wrap this little tail end or you can
just<00:01:10.080> wrap<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.980> like<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:13.280> wrap<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
for the double-sided tape one I'm going

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.620 
for the double-sided tape one I'm going
to<00:01:41.840> do<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.320> two<00:01:42.710> stranded<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.360> take<00:01:44.479> your

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.130 
thing about the double sided tape is
that<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.700> pretty<00:02:04.970> much<00:02:05.180> done<00:02:05.540> once<00:02:05.899> you

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
that it's pretty much done once you

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.719 
that it's pretty much done once you
don't<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.500> let<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.770> sit<00:02:06.979> overnight<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.520> tacky

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
hot glue is more mushy and it's hot and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.770 
hot glue is more mushy and it's hot and
I<00:02:13.070> always<00:02:13.280> thrown<00:02:13.640> myself<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.330> use<00:02:14.510> hot

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780

I always thrown myself and I use hot
glue<00:02:14.810> oh<00:02:15.850> hopefully<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.060> don't<00:02:17.270> have<00:02:17.480> that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
glue oh hopefully you don't have that

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.390
