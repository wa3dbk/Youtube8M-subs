squadron<00:01:47.910> and<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.380> an<00:01:49.470> airplane<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
squadron and it's just an airplane that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.040 
squadron and it's just an airplane that
other<00:01:50.040> crews<00:01:50.400> fly<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.180> their<00:01:51.390> airplanes<00:01:51.810> down

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
other crews fly if their airplanes down

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.960 
other crews fly if their airplanes down
they<00:01:52.320> find<00:01:52.620> it<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> crew<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.580> mix<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
they find it they have a crew of mix and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.610 
they find it they have a crew of mix and
match<00:01:54.120> these<00:01:54.660> guys<00:01:54.900> fly<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.140> airplane<00:01:55.500> as

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
match these guys fly the airplane as

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.800 
match these guys fly the airplane as
well<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.910> up<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> hundred

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
well so there's really up to a hundred

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.390 
well so there's really up to a hundred
different<00:01:58.170> individuals<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.070> flown<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
different individuals have flown this

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.860 
different individuals have flown this
airplane<00:01:59.580> over<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.150> course<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> those<00:02:00.660> two

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
airplane over the course of those two

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.440 
airplane over the course of those two
hundred<00:02:00.960> missions<00:02:01.230> black<00:02:02.190> fate<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.700> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
hundred missions black fate is really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.050 
hundred missions black fate is really
important<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.230> sense<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.530> no<00:02:04.910> crew<00:02:05.910> were

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
important in the sense that no crew were

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.020 
important in the sense that no crew were
lost<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.810> area<00:02:07.280> at<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.520> point<00:02:08.550> there's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
lost in this area at one point there's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
lost in this area at one point there's
you<00:02:09.360> know<00:02:09.390> cannon<00:02:09.780> damage<00:02:10.170> where<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you know cannon damage where the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.530 
you know cannon damage where the
plexiglass<00:02:11.310> nose<00:02:11.579> disintegrates<00:02:12.359> in<00:02:12.480> the

plexiglass nose disintegrates in the
face<00:02:12.689> of<00:02:12.719> the<00:02:12.900> Bombardier<00:02:13.579> they<00:02:14.579> lose<00:02:14.760> an

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
face of the Bombardier they lose an

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.399 
face of the Bombardier they lose an
engine<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.359> lose<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.659> electrical<00:02:16.019> system

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
engine they lose the electrical system

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:16.830 
engine they lose the electrical system
but<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.590> all

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
but it all

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.839 
but it all
he<00:02:16.900> gets<00:02:17.110> back<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:17.830> every<00:02:18.129> mission<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.550> sense

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
he gets back so every mission that sense

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.630 
he gets back so every mission that sense
of<00:02:18.940> survivability<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.830> it's<00:02:20.950> also<00:02:21.099> seen<00:02:21.489> by

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
of survivability but it's also seen by

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
of survivability but it's also seen by
the<00:02:21.700> crews<00:02:22.150> as<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.319> like<00:02:23.470> the

there's a story of this airplane named

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.300 
there's a story of this airplane named
flak<00:03:10.510> bait<00:03:10.780> how<00:03:11.290> many<00:03:11.470> bombs<00:03:11.650> has<00:03:11.890> dropped<00:03:12.129> how

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
flak bait how many bombs has dropped how

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.390 
flak bait how many bombs has dropped how
it's<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.549> survivor<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:14.170> leads<00:03:14.410> us<00:03:14.650> allegis

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it's a survivor and it leads us allegis

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's a survivor and it leads us allegis
bomb<00:03:15.579> groups<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.910> three<00:03:16.090> 20<00:03:16.209> second<00:03:16.690> bomb

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
bomb groups of three 20 second bomb

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.100 
bomb groups of three 20 second bomb
proof<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:18.030> target<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.090> Germany<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.599> back

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
proof to a target in Germany and back

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.960 
proof to a target in Germany and back

Europe during World War two and this is

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.670 
Europe during World War two and this is
an<00:04:02.730> original<00:04:02.969> airplane<00:04:03.659> it's<00:04:04.139> got<00:04:04.379> some

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
an original airplane it's got some

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.339 
an original airplane it's got some
damage<00:04:04.969> from<00:04:05.969> being<00:04:06.450> transported<00:04:06.930> back<00:04:07.170> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
damage from being transported back the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.979 
damage from being transported back the
u.s.<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:08.189> been<00:04:08.400> stored<00:04:08.760> it's<00:04:09.209> gotten

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
u.s. it's been stored it's gotten

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.539 
u.s. it's been stored it's gotten
dirtier<00:04:10.409> over<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.829> years<00:04:11.129> but<00:04:11.400> it's

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
dirtier over the years but it's

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.280 
dirtier over the years but it's
essentially<00:04:11.939> as<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.450> was<00:04:12.659> at<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> end<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.170> that

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
essentially as it was at the end of that

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.920 
essentially as it was at the end of that
conflict<00:04:13.739> one<00:04:13.889> was<00:04:14.069> disassembled<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.689> the

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
conflict one was disassembled and so the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.469 
conflict one was disassembled and so the
primary<00:04:16.349> goal<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.889> this<00:04:17.009> project<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.759> to<00:04:18.060> clean

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
primary goal of this project is to clean

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.449 
primary goal of this project is to clean
and<00:04:18.660> stabilize<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.440> preserve<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.979> artifact

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
and stabilize and preserve the artifact

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.460 
and stabilize and preserve the artifact
and<00:04:20.699> then<00:04:21.209> put<00:04:21.389> it<00:04:21.479> on<00:04:21.570> display<00:04:21.750> as<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.169> fully

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
and then put it on display as a fully

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.110 
and then put it on display as a fully
assembled<00:04:22.949> airplane<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.520> first<00:04:23.729> time<00:04:23.940> has

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
assembled airplane the first time has

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.879 
assembled airplane the first time has
been<00:04:24.300> all<00:04:24.419> together<00:04:24.630> since<00:04:25.199> nineteen<00:04:25.620> forty

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889
