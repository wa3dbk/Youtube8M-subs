00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
is actually really cool because it tells

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.349 
is actually really cool because it tells
me<00:03:01.889> like<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:05.099> then<00:03:05.400> I'm<00:03:05.700> not<00:03:05.909> later

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
me like you know so then I'm not later

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.220 
me like you know so then I'm not later
oh<00:03:06.689> wow<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:08.299> really<00:03:09.299> slanted<00:03:10.200> I

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
oh wow this is like really slanted I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.979 
oh wow this is like really slanted I
needed<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.769> make<00:03:10.919> that<00:03:11.159> more<00:03:11.370> straight<00:03:11.939> so<00:03:12.930> you

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
needed to make that more straight so you

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.409 
needed to make that more straight so you
just<00:03:13.560> line<00:03:13.889> it<00:03:13.919> up<00:03:14.189> before<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.760> start<00:03:14.849> and

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
just line it up before you start and

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.929 
just line it up before you start and
then<00:03:15.599> you<00:03:15.719> can<00:03:15.840> obviously<00:03:16.169> do<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.849> again

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
then you can obviously do that so again

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.939 
then you can obviously do that so again
