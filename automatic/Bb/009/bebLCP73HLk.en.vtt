00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.620
 consists that we are happy 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.930

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.000
 as it is pain moya has just opened 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.710
 here your first sewing workshop called 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.420
 cloth and scissors and I could not 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.900
 lose so I go in and now 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.900
 I tell you 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509
 as well 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 It is created as a meeting point 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.219
 of Valencian fashion we want apart from 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.260
 offer workshops that people come 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.390
 fabrics and scissors to expose their 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 costumes to make your mark 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 corporate to be able to develop another 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.060
 kind of more creative women workshops 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.649
 that are not cutting and making as 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.539
 they can be dismay of clothes 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.460
 t-shirts and now you 're also going to do 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.680
 some corporate image courses for 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.259
 the designers how to develop their 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.920
 brand image and then be able to sell their 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.069
 products 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.100
 I had the illusion that my daughters 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.840
 some of my daughters study design 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.750
 to study sewing on all sewing 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 because I love the sewing or the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.420
 Sewing for me is not a job 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 sewing for me is really my life the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.540
 create this open space 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 I think that people are going to fit 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.320
 very well it will be very nice 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.200
 so what we want to create is friends 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 friends friends that even then in a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.560
 given time we can do something even more 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 important that we say that it will come 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.190
 much later now is a first step 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.380
 to make friends so they learn to 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.070
 that people know sewing from 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.630
 inside and how good you never know to see that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.370
 a person of those who have gone through 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.550
 here I get to this point because a little is 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 my goal is not good because it started here goes 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.870
 It seems very good to me on the part of the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.390
 professional that is I think the world of 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.420
 sewing and the world of pattern making 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.850
 and around us must have 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.350
 continuity is all that is to join 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.510
 professionals and form good 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.740
 professionals is what matters for the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.960
 community and for the guild 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.430
 you know every day when it happens 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.890
 because I also have the study of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 yesterday here very close we are 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.710
 of the same profession and the truth that the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 I admire but 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.030
 there is much mutual sympathy I wanted 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.260
 a lot of knowing what they were going to do and more 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.760
 knowing a professional takes so many 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.800
 years in the confection because it seems to me a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.870
 fantastic idea that offers this kind of 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.990
 service with so much demand I think 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.990
 cool 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.800
 Well, you 've seen everything there is 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.510
 here and they have even given me a gift like this 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.769
 that nothing if I get the seamstress vein 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.099
 I already know where I have to come to 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.099
 to learn
