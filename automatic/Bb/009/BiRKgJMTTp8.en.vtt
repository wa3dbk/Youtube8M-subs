00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
lot of hatred towards rushes and I want

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.990 
lot of hatred towards rushes and I want
to<00:00:17.460> try<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.910> clear<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.859> that<00:00:19.859> hatred<00:00:20.189> somewhat

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
to try and clear up that hatred somewhat

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.920 
to try and clear up that hatred somewhat
at<00:00:21.150> least<00:00:21.439> and<00:00:22.439> maybe<00:00:23.430> make<00:00:24.240> people<00:00:24.539> look<00:00:24.720> at

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
at least and maybe make people look at

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
at least and maybe make people look at
the<00:00:25.109> situation<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.949> different<00:00:26.310> light<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the situation in a different light the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.519 
the situation in a different light the
light<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.449> I've<00:00:27.599> always<00:00:27.779> looked<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.380> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and I think most people should look at

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.260 
and I think most people should look at
it<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:31.800> course<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:33.239> opinion

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
opinion so I don't think the claw

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.639 
opinion so I don't think the claw
brushing<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:57.329> bad<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:57.930> people<00:00:58.320> make<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> out

to be I think the thing that makes
flourishes<00:01:02.059> successful<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:04.280> people's<00:01:05.280> lack

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
flourishes successful is people's lack

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.450 
flourishes successful is people's lack
of<00:01:05.700> skill<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> wilderness<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.430> of

hate those things i don't like them I
think<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:47.939> ruin<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> wilderness<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.140> just

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
think they ruin the wilderness but just

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.340 
think they ruin the wilderness but just
stuff<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:49.979> dark<00:01:50.939> bow<00:01:51.210> rushing<00:01:51.659> hand<00:01:51.960> cannon

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
stuff like dark bow rushing hand cannon

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.490 
stuff like dark bow rushing hand cannon
rushing<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.920> claw<00:01:53.220> rushing<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.500> so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
rushing and claw rushing I think it's so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.819 
rushing and claw rushing I think it's so
so<00:01:56.009> easy<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.700> avoid<00:01:57.149> dying<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.649> get

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so easy to avoid dying when you get

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.760 
so easy to avoid dying when you get
rushed<00:01:59.119> there<00:02:00.119> isn't<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.600> any<00:02:01.049> valid

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
rushed there isn't really any valid

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
rushed there isn't really any valid
excuse<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.640> don't<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.320> flourishes

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
excuse I don't think that flourishes

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.889 
excuse I don't think that flourishes
deserve<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.219> hate<00:02:05.430> they<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.570> saying

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
deserve the hate they get I'm not saying

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.499

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.500 
yeah so that is my opinion on rushing I
don't<00:03:08.890> expect<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.700> get<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.910> lot<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.150> love<00:03:10.360> on

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
don't expect to get a lot of love on

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.620 
don't expect to get a lot of love on
this<00:03:10.630> video<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.560> but<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.610> how<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.790> justify

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
this video the but that is how I justify

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.550 
this video the but that is how I justify
rushing<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.800> my<00:03:15.070> own<00:03:15.310> mind<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.940> feel<00:03:16.540> if<00:03:17.170> they

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
rushing in my own mind I feel if they

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.360 
rushing in my own mind I feel if they
don't<00:03:17.830> deserve<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.220> die<00:03:18.610> they<00:03:19.180> won't<00:03:19.420> die<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
don't deserve to die they won't die and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.550 
don't deserve to die they won't die and
I<00:03:21.459> think<00:03:21.520> that's<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.360> only<00:03:22.390> way<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.140> look<00:03:23.440> at

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
I think that's the only way to look at

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.150 
I think that's the only way to look at
it<00:03:23.650> in<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.130> majority<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.640> cases<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.780> yeah

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
it in the majority of cases so yeah

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.410 
it in the majority of cases so yeah
