00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.190
 let's mention what makes the fame of three after having of course 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.400
 his andouillette on the occasion of the publication of a book which is 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.910
 dedicated its author who laid his arms 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 it's the work of political parties 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 for the regional page of stress contracts 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.850
 now here is going to interest andouillette lovers and no 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 any andouillette of 3 is in the spotlight in a book that comes 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 to go out to editions 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.270
 the four founder paths that houses the arms she practically has day for 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.180
 day then you're a journalist with gourmet and gourmet and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.090
 seems good thank you for having made the trip to come to us 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 so why have you set your sights on the three-year-old angolagate that the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.700
 scared must yet no I'm not at the wood I'm just greedy and why 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.100
 not envious of troy because I love driving three years 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 and I also have plenty of things that can be found in the early morning 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.200
 very good planchot found in water cider chaource champagne 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.290
 all of this makes English become a must in the very first films of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.750
 the chaumont collection 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.530
 you tell it a story of this company 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 it's not necessarily obvious either you've found Athens so I 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450
 found the items I spent quite a bit of giving them a back shop 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.390
 pork butchers for the taste of the games happened a lot of two hours a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 whole week 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.789
 at the national library of france in paris and I found texts 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.860
 actually of andouillette emotion 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.530
 to six old and and then I always come to reconstruct the story of 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.800
 rambouillet since not activists but the Gallo-Roman period then 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.900
 precisely in this story that is worth that otherwise pieced together you 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.520
 explain why we say andrew yates 2 3 while paradoxically she did not 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.699
 been created there 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:17.009
 a priori either she had to become famous at 3 he plays 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.919
 good sign we think in the day many to think that the Trojans have been 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.209
 packaged more banal coup authorities in strips in France 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.189
 since they have a little bit imposed so there is place of three that actually 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.259
 is not two three in the geographical sense of the word but rather 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.159
 three in the way for the factory which one has for the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.069
 preparation to say what is the particularity she apprehends are two 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.029
 three marconnet how then that I went all report one while one 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.129
 can say dara this furniture of Cambrai they are made with the strawberry of veal 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.790
 to drive from three to port 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.409
 he is pulled to the string 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.209
 and then he sees it here it's mainly the tribes how come the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.869
 peculiarities of the place of three 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.370
 while all true lovers of andouillette know the target 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.670
 5 approving the state next to what that means is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.280
 the ball and how do we get so it's the friendly association of 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.179
 authentic andouillette lovers 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.289
 it is an association of critical journalists 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.379
 % and food columnist 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.650
 who ap tribus rebuffs this label after tasting the skin 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.629
 lasts more than a tasting would an autopsy speech the cut one did not 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.669
 not very lucky 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.369
 then we tasted obviously and for that we give so those who do not have 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.549
 what I do I do not do it for five years I eat with them and 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.219
 So the backpacks of this label weapons manufactured in 2008 in France 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 deserves them every five years so meet three heroes about 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.159
