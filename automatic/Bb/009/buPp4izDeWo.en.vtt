 population 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.959
 most likely these goals 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.530
 pretty wide 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.230
 write to the light of Irkutskstat in the temple

 so here it is logical that the metal deficiency 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.760
 however the construction market 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.590
 electricity

 confirms an example of what they start 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.440
 feel that they can save not 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.099
