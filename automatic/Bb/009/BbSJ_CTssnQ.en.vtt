as<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.660> seen<00:00:50.900> saw<00:00:51.290> in<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.530> intro<00:00:51.890> basically<00:00:52.790> I

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
as you seen saw in the intro basically I

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.850 
as you seen saw in the intro basically I
shot<00:00:53.480> my<00:00:53.660> rod<00:00:53.840> somewhere<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.590> bunch<00:00:54.769> of

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
shot my rod somewhere and a bunch of

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.619 
shot my rod somewhere and a bunch of
falling<00:00:55.190> sand<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.699> he's<00:00:55.940> led<00:00:56.180> up<00:00:56.330> to<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.540> and

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
falling sand and he's led up to it and

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.440 
falling sand and he's led up to it and
then<00:00:57.379> when<00:00:57.680> it<00:00:57.800> landed<00:00:58.160> they<00:00:58.519> disappeared<00:00:59.180> and

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
then when it landed they disappeared and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.180 
then when it landed they disappeared and
some<00:01:00.440> ice<00:01:00.879> appeared<00:01:01.879> there<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:02.739> yeah<00:01:03.739> it's

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
some ice appeared there so yeah it's

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.609 
some ice appeared there so yeah it's
pretty<00:01:04.369> fun<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.820> use<00:01:05.000> not<00:01:05.960> sure<00:01:06.170> it'll<00:01:06.500> be

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
pretty fun to use not sure it'll be

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.889 
pretty fun to use not sure it'll be
really<00:01:06.649> useful<00:01:07.070> for<00:01:07.580> but<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.270> feel<00:01:08.420> like<00:01:08.660> it

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
really useful for but I feel like it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.660 
really useful for but I feel like it
might<00:01:09.020> be<00:01:09.170> useful<00:01:09.259> for<00:01:09.470> adventure<00:01:10.039> maps<00:01:10.250> where

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
might be useful for adventure maps where

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.380 
might be useful for adventure maps where
you<00:01:10.910> have<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:12.399> torches<00:01:13.399> or<00:01:13.729> maybe<00:01:14.030> Slava

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
you have to like torches or maybe Slava

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.380 
you have to like torches or maybe Slava
maybe<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.080> fire<00:01:15.380> maybe<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:16.550> even<00:01:16.670> T&amp;T<00:01:17.210> or

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
maybe it's fire maybe it's even T&amp;T or

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.540 
maybe it's fire maybe it's even T&amp;T or
something<00:01:17.810> but<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.649> just<00:01:18.920> think<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.220> looks

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
something but I just think it looks

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.279 
something but I just think it looks
really<00:01:19.820> cool<00:01:20.149> and<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> animations<00:01:20.930> really

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
really cool and the animations really

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.920 
really cool and the animations really
nice<00:01:21.470> how<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.920> like<00:01:22.070> drops<00:01:22.100> these<00:01:22.910> drops<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
nice how it like drops these drops the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.320 
nice how it like drops these drops the
falling<00:01:24.289> sand<00:01:24.560> entities<00:01:25.070> behind<00:01:25.550> it<00:01:25.759> when<00:01:26.240> it

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
falling sand entities behind it when it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.230 
falling sand entities behind it when it
lands<00:01:26.720> i<00:01:27.500> purposely<00:01:28.130> did<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.759> think<00:01:29.090> it's

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
lands i purposely did that I think it's

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.460 
lands i purposely did that I think it's
really<00:01:29.509> cool<00:01:29.869> um<00:01:30.880> yeah<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.259> another

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
really cool um yeah so this is another

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.550 
really cool um yeah so this is another
one<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.190> simple<00:01:34.789> redstone<00:01:35.560> videos

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
one of the really simple redstone videos

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.699 
one of the really simple redstone videos
that<00:01:36.740> I've<00:01:36.830> been<00:01:36.950> doing<00:01:37.190> really<00:01:37.520> often

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
that I've been doing really often

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.240 
that I've been doing really often
dragging<00:01:39.709> along<00:01:39.920> behind<00:01:40.190> me

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
dragging along behind me

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.680 
dragging along behind me
that<00:01:41.880> I've<00:01:42.000> been<00:01:42.060> doing<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.450> often

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
that I've been doing really often

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.320 
that I've been doing really often
basically<00:01:43.440> all<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.890> or<00:01:44.700> command<00:01:45.090> blocks

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
basically all it is or command blocks

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.060 
basically all it is or command blocks
this<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.260> something<00:01:46.650> repeatedly

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this one is something repeatedly

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
this one is something repeatedly
something<00:01:47.460> summoning<00:01:48.150> falling<00:01:48.540> sand<00:01:48.780> entity

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
something summoning falling sand entity

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.270 
something summoning falling sand entity
one<00:01:50.130> block<00:01:50.370> over<00:01:50.580> all<00:01:51.300> these<00:01:51.840> ice<00:01:52.620> blocks<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
one block over all these ice blocks that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
one block over all these ice blocks that
are<00:01:53.340> falling<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.729> into<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.150> void<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.680> they

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
are falling down into the void and they

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
are falling down into the void and they
have<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.760> tile<00:01:56.940> idea<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.390> 79<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.470> ice

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
have the tile idea of 79 which is ice

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.140 
have the tile idea of 79 which is ice
now<00:01:59.280> let's<00:01:59.520> say<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> changed<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.310> yeah

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
now let's say I changed to one or yeah

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.180 
now let's say I changed to one or yeah
one<00:02:03.390> yeah<00:02:08.959> if<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.080> can't<00:02:10.289> check<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> porch<00:02:10.770> now

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
one yeah if I can't check the porch now

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
one yeah if I can't check the porch now
when<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.610> fish<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
when I fish with

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.240 
when I fish with
it<00:02:14.130> will<00:02:14.430> drop<00:02:14.850> quartz<00:02:15.240> blocks<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.920> one<00:02:16.920> ice

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it will drop quartz blocks and one ice

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.330 
it will drop quartz blocks and one ice
blocks<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.850> still<00:02:18.060> loading<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> fort<00:02:18.900> walks

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
blocks was still loading the fort walks

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.980 
blocks was still loading the fort walks
so<00:02:20.340> basically<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.850> fully<00:02:21.270> customizable

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
so basically this fully customizable

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.630 
so basically this fully customizable
