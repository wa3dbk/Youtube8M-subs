you'd<00:02:43.660> want<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.989> do<00:02:44.170> something<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:46.350> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
you'd want to do something like that so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.710 
you'd want to do something like that so
md<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.470> size<00:02:50.800> you'll<00:02:51.640> notice<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.209> hound<00:02:52.450> dog

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
md for size you'll notice the hound dog

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.670 
md for size you'll notice the hound dog
has<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> more<00:02:53.590> gradual<00:02:54.220> taper<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:56.410> head

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
has a more gradual taper of the head

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.360 
has a more gradual taper of the head
then<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.549> Wildcat<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.570> either<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.370> the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
then the Wildcat with either the the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.630 
then the Wildcat with either the the
older<00:03:00.670> for<00:03:01.170> LED<00:03:02.170> module<00:03:02.709> or<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> newer<00:03:03.250> three

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
older for LED module or the newer three

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.070 
older for LED module or the newer three
LED<00:03:04.209> module<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.239> one<00:03:07.750> deep

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
LED module this is just a one deep

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.140 
LED module this is just a one deep
reflector<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:08.980> here<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:09.700> got<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.880> long

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
reflector on here so it's got a long

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.199 
reflector on here so it's got a long
tapered<00:03:10.630> head<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:11.260> easy<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.519> hang<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.910> to

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
tapered head but it's easy to hang on to

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.750 
tapered head but it's easy to hang on to
so<00:03:13.540> if<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.840> put<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.170> back<00:03:14.350> on<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.620> md<00:03:15.130> 2<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.610> i

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
so if you put it back on the md 2 as i

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.680 
so if you put it back on the md 2 as i
showed<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.360> can<00:03:17.230> grip<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.560> very<00:03:18.250> well<00:03:18.690> just
