speaking<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.670> totally<00:02:36.150> worth<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.510> but

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
speaking it was totally worth it but

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.630 
speaking it was totally worth it but
financially<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> help<00:02:38.460> me

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.460 
comedian so for us a lot of us went to
college<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.760> did<00:03:33.210> that<00:03:33.540> thing<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.140> studied

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
college and we did that thing I studied

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
college and we did that thing I studied
political<00:03:34.590> science

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
political science

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.640 
political science
and<00:03:35.670> it's<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.240> bachelor's<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> Arts<00:03:37.230> degree

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and it's a bachelor's of the Arts degree

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.560 
and it's a bachelor's of the Arts degree
so<00:03:37.890> I'm<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.250> bachelor's<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> Arts<00:03:39.210> in<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
so I'm a bachelor's of the Arts in a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.080 
so I'm a bachelor's of the Arts in a
science<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.530> doesn't<00:03:40.890> really<00:03:41.280> make<00:03:41.640> sense<00:03:41.670> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
science it doesn't really make sense a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.180 
science it doesn't really make sense a
bachelor's<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.020> science<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.830> arts

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190

its technical you do learn a lot of
technical<00:03:51.000> skills<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:51.900> are<00:03:52.140> people

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
technical skills but there are people

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.820

supposed<00:04:15.960> to<00:04:16.170> be<00:04:16.260> about<00:04:16.470> academics<00:04:17.160> and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
supposed to be about academics and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.830 
supposed to be about academics and
learning<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.609> trade<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.970> some<00:04:18.150> extent<00:04:18.450> but<00:04:18.660> I

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
learning a trade to some extent but I

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.150 
learning a trade to some extent but I
think<00:04:19.229> everybody<00:04:19.530> knows<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.680> American

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
think everybody knows that American

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.770 
think everybody knows that American
colleges<00:04:20.489> are<00:04:20.640> typically<00:04:21.060> more<00:04:21.210> focused<00:04:21.660> on

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
colleges are typically more focused on

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.570 
colleges are typically more focused on
sort<00:04:22.020> of<00:04:22.080> live

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
sort of live

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.820 
sort of live
arts<00:04:22.940> training<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.569> the<00:04:23.720> whole<00:04:23.930> person<00:04:24.319> and

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
arts training of the whole person and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.529 
arts training of the whole person and
all<00:04:25.009> that<00:04:25.190> then<00:04:25.400> then<00:04:25.759> another<00:04:25.940> country's<00:04:26.300> one

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
all that then then another country's one

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.969 
all that then then another country's one
of<00:04:26.599> the<00:04:26.660> reasons<00:04:26.960> like<00:04:27.050> UK<00:04:27.410> students<00:04:27.770> start<00:04:27.949> to

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
of the reasons like UK students start to

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.980 
of the reasons like UK students start to
come<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.400> us<00:04:29.000> colleges<00:04:29.539> more<00:04:29.750> than<00:04:29.870> they<00:04:29.960> ever

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
come to us colleges more than they ever

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.730 
come to us colleges more than they ever
were<00:04:30.199> in<00:04:30.259> the<00:04:30.319> past

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
were in the past

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.469 
were in the past
so<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.400> not<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.789> about<00:04:31.909> learning<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
so it's not just about learning the

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.939 
so it's not just about learning the
trade<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:33.020> developing<00:04:33.229> as<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> person

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
trade it's about developing as a person

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.830 
trade it's about developing as a person
and<00:04:34.460> learning<00:04:34.789> about<00:04:34.970> how<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.449> be<00:04:35.599> independent

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
and learning about how to be independent

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.110 
and learning about how to be independent
how<00:04:36.440> to<00:04:36.500> interact<00:04:36.949> with<00:04:37.039> people<00:04:37.280> diversity

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
how to interact with people diversity

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.249 
how to interact with people diversity
and<00:04:38.330> all<00:04:38.479> these<00:04:38.629> different<00:04:38.960> things<00:04:38.990> you

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
and all these different things you

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.960 
and all these different things you
didn't<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.500> you're<00:04:39.680> interested<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:40.129> and<00:04:40.340> so

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
didn't know you're interested in and so

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.059 
didn't know you're interested in and so
here's<00:04:41.389> here's<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.780> want<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.020> compare<00:04:42.319> think

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
here's here's I want to compare think

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.219 
here's here's I want to compare think
about<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.340> people<00:04:43.520> uh<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.990> went<00:04:45.169> to

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
about the people uh that that went to

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.839 
about the people uh that that went to
college<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.710> know<00:04:45.800> think<00:04:46.699> about<00:04:46.729> the

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
college that you know think about the

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:47.800 
college that you know think about the
people<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.270> went<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.449> high<00:04:47.539> school<00:04:47.569> with

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
people that you went to high school with

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.330 
people that you went to high school with
didn't<00:04:48.229> then<00:04:48.319> go<00:04:48.470> on<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.590> college<00:04:48.710> nothing

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
didn't then go on to college nothing

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.260 
didn't then go on to college nothing
against<00:04:49.639> people<00:04:49.849> who<00:04:49.909> didn't<00:04:50.060> go<00:04:50.120> into

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
against people who didn't go into

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.180 
against people who didn't go into
college<00:04:50.419> but<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.960> think<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.379> general<00:04:51.560> it's<00:04:51.919> sort

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
college but I think in general it's sort

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.379 
college but I think in general it's sort
of<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.310> different<00:04:52.610> thing<00:04:52.759> in<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> way<00:04:53.180> that

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
of a different thing in the way that

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.180 
of a different thing in the way that
people<00:04:53.419> develop<00:04:54.199> is<00:04:54.349> sort<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.620> different<00:04:55.039> and

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
people develop is sort of different and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.040 
people develop is sort of different and
so<00:04:55.759> what<00:04:56.330> do<00:04:56.389> you<00:04:56.449> think<00:04:56.599> about<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:56.870> is<00:04:57.020> that

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
so what do you think about that is that

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.320 
so what do you think about that is that
