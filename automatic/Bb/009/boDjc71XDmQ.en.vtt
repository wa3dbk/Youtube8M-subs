light<00:01:47.700> reflecting<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.600> stuff<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
light reflecting all of that stuff it is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
light reflecting all of that stuff it is
none<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> literally<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
none of that it is literally just a

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.600 
none of that it is literally just a
colored<00:01:52.049> liquid<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.130> course<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.460> got

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
colored liquid and of course it's got

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.749 
colored liquid and of course it's got
SPF<00:01:54.030> 25<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.979> also<00:01:56.159> claims<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
SPF 25 and it also claims to be

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.069 
SPF 25 and it also claims to be
whitening<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
whitening but I actually think that

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.289 
whitening but I actually think that
that's<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.560> likely<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.969> because

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
that's more likely to be just because

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.569 
that's more likely to be just because
it's<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:01.219> protects<00:02:02.219> against<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it's actually protects against the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.819 
it's actually protects against the
sunshine<00:02:03.000> which<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.780> causes<00:02:04.380> wrinkles

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
sunshine which is what causes wrinkles

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.969 
sunshine which is what causes wrinkles
and<00:02:05.219> things<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.670> anyway<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
and things like that anyway so this is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.430 
and things like that anyway so this is
what<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.369> looks<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> woke<00:02:08.970> submitted

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
what it looks like when I woke submitted

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.990 
what it looks like when I woke submitted
to<00:02:09.530> my<00:02:09.680> hand<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.070> little<00:02:10.100> bit<00:02:10.400> as<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.670> can<00:02:10.700> see

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
to my hand a little bit as you can see

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.370 
to my hand a little bit as you can see
it's<00:02:11.300> definitely<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.840> slightly<00:02:12.200> different

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
it's definitely a slightly different

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.620 
it's definitely a slightly different
color<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.980> my<00:02:13.130> skin<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.180> tell<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
color to my skin but you can tell that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.970 
color to my skin but you can tell that
it's<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:15.080> bright<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:16.100> not<00:02:16.370> shiny<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.660> not

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's not bright it's not shiny it's not

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's not bright it's not shiny it's not
it<00:02:18.980> doesn't<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.400> any<00:02:19.640> particular<00:02:20.030> qualities

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it doesn't have any particular qualities

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.240 
it doesn't have any particular qualities
in<00:02:20.780> an<00:02:20.870> apartment<00:02:21.290> or<00:02:21.470> popping<00:02:21.770> up<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.070> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
in an apartment or popping up there that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.310 
in an apartment or popping up there that
looks<00:02:22.430> quite<00:02:22.700> greasy<00:02:22.940> doesn't<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.140> that's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
looks quite greasy doesn't it and that's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.810 
looks quite greasy doesn't it and that's
another<00:02:24.560> thing<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:25.040> does<00:02:25.070> feel<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> little

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
another thing it does feel a little

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.720 
another thing it does feel a little
thick<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:26.660> if<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.870> apply<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.260> with<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.830> just

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
thick but if you apply it with a just

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.720 
thick but if you apply it with a just
round<00:02:29.330> head<00:02:29.630> powder<00:02:29.960> brush<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.980> then

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
round head powder brush like this then

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.220 
round head powder brush like this then
you<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.210> easily<00:02:32.450> get<00:02:32.720> away<00:02:32.900> from<00:02:33.080> that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
you can easily get away from that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.450 
you can easily get away from that
feeling<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.710> doesn't<00:02:33.950> feel<00:02:34.040> anywhere

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
feeling and it doesn't feel anywhere

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460 
feeling and it doesn't feel anywhere
near<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.790> thick<00:02:35.000> at<00:02:35.180> all<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:35.840> when<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.020> compare

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
near as thick at all but when I compare

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.810 
near as thick at all but when I compare
this<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.830> another<00:02:36.860> foundation<00:02:37.700> this

to be I like my skin to radiate and glow

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.390 
to be I like my skin to radiate and glow
like<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.240> glowing<00:02:56.780> radiator<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.010> if<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.250> are

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
like a glowing radiator so if you are

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490 
like a glowing radiator so if you are
going<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.730> use<00:02:58.940> BB<00:02:59.180> cream<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.660> would<00:02:59.780> say<00:03:00.260> that

going to use BB cream I would say that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.720 
going to use BB cream I would say that
you<00:03:00.590> should<00:03:00.800> probably<00:03:00.950> use<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.460> with<00:03:01.610> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
you should probably use it with a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.850 
you should probably use it with a
concealer<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.660> lighten<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.500> certain

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
concealer just to lighten up certain

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.830 
concealer just to lighten up certain
areas<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> your<00:03:04.460> face<00:03:04.640> another<00:03:05.480> thing<00:03:05.720> about

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
areas of your face another thing about

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.870 
areas of your face another thing about
the<00:03:06.020> feeling<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.650> product<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.610> it

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
the feeling of the product is that it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.570 
the feeling of the product is that it
transfers<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.900> lot<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.680> doesn't<00:03:09.980> really<00:03:10.340> ever

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
transfers a lot it doesn't really ever

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.640 
transfers a lot it doesn't really ever
properly<00:03:11.270> set<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:11.990> think<00:03:12.230> that's<00:03:12.410> because

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
properly set and I think that's because

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.340 
properly set and I think that's because
it's<00:03:12.860> quite<00:03:13.340> almost<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.480> an<00:03:14.600> SPF<00:03:15.050> you<00:03:15.230> know

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it's quite almost like an SPF you know

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.140 
it's quite almost like an SPF you know
you<00:03:15.410> always<00:03:15.800> have<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.130> slight<00:03:16.520> feeling<00:03:16.850> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
you always have that slight feeling of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.850 
you always have that slight feeling of
something<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.600> your<00:03:17.720> skin<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.620> will

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
something on your skin and it will

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.070 
something on your skin and it will
transfer<00:03:19.670> off<00:03:19.970> unless<00:03:20.420> you're<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.900> set

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
transfer off unless you're going to set

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.080 
transfer off unless you're going to set
it<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.380> then<00:03:21.590> setting<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> after<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.880> while

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
it but then setting it after a while

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.180 
it but then setting it after a while
doesn't<00:03:23.450> make<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.900> look<00:03:24.080> as<00:03:24.350> youthful<00:03:25.070> and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
doesn't make it look as youthful and

of<00:05:17.990> fashion<00:05:18.470> male<00:05:18.710> I<00:05:19.070> think<00:05:19.100> it<00:05:19.370> would<00:05:19.490> be

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
of fashion male I think it would be

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.790 
of fashion male I think it would be
perfect<00:05:20.090> as<00:05:20.270> an<00:05:20.390> all-over<00:05:20.600> base<00:05:21.020> because<00:05:21.560> it

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
perfect as an all-over base because it

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.630 
perfect as an all-over base because it
won't<00:05:22.600> highlight<00:05:23.600> your<00:05:23.810> skin<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.280> just

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
won't highlight your skin so it just

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.200 
won't highlight your skin so it just
sort<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:25.940> corrects<00:05:27.010> imperfections<00:05:28.060> which<00:05:29.060> is

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
sort of corrects imperfections which is

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.090 
sort of corrects imperfections which is
perfect<00:05:29.600> if<00:05:29.750> you're<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:30.350> average<00:05:30.620> guy<00:05:30.800> I

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
perfect if you're the average guy I

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.320 
perfect if you're the average guy I
think<00:05:31.430> right<00:05:31.670> and<00:05:31.790> you<00:05:31.910> want<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.090> look<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.300> bit

that little bit of a flawless look

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.090 
that little bit of a flawless look
without<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.900> being<00:05:39.020> too<00:05:39.140> over-the-top<00:05:39.530> that

without it being too over-the-top that

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.480 
without it being too over-the-top that

some people might not like but any of us

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.910 
some people might not like but any of us
