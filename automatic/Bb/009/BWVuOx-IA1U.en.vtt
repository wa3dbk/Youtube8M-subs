00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.100
 and good day dear 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.970
 project users and participants public 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
 roleplay 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.590
 already implemented innovations 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 Today I will tell 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 Yuri remind you that this is the third issue 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.820
 developer diary 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 the previous storyteller she could 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.650
 voice this video on 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 technical reasons but now perhaps 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can start first of all wanted 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.080
 would start the phone system and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.540
 learn more about it, this 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.820
 the system is a single dialogue 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.559
 many features that are 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.729
 the most optimal and you 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.830
 demanding developers decided that 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.559
 will not implement a system of different 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.530
 battery operators and firms 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.630
 phones for two simple reasons for their 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.140
 opinion, these actions do not affect 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 negatively at the very process of the game yes and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.440
 as previously stated 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.060
 actions on the server will be 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.210
 unfold back in 1992 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 but as we all know at that time not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.009
 there was such an abundance of various companies 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.290
 and now of course we'll talk 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.259
 directly about the functions themselves 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.899
 phone to someone 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.490
 call or send sms to you 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.329
 you need to top up the balance of your mobile 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.850
 numbers 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.720
 this can be done through any terminal 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.970
 in our state 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.590
 also the development team 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.450
 provided a list of contacts which 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.179
 filled by yourself 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.149
 I want to note that you call the contact 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.240
 you can as you like it be klitschko 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.170
 first or last name delete contacts 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.880
 list also present 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.679
 clicking on any contact you will be 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.560
 provided a menu where you can 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.860
 perform various actions related to 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.700
 these contacts for example change the name or 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.760
 number well it 's not all developers 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.580
 included audio plugin with which 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.319
 any owner of the phone can change 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.920
 ring tone and 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.920
 text messages 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.200
 Last in this system system offline 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 text messages 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.659
 I will explain the player can at any time 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.959
 send sms to another player regardless 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:16.799
 from the status of the recipient online or offline 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.650
 with m with will come in the incoming sms at any 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.560
 convenient time it can be read and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.319
 send reply to the following 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.079
 what did the developers of inventory 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.290
 many question and what is it 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.129
 is everything just an inventory free 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.069
 space 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.500
 assigned to the player in this very 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.040
 space the user can store 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.109
 various things fixtures 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.680
 to transfer them sale or 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.989
 I would just like to throw it out. 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.810
 note that inventory is not pockets 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.269
 the character does not bag fixed back 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.790
 characters not bag this space 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.620
 allowing you to store things from this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.900
 follow what the future needs 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.919
 act out actions related to 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.750
 inventory and not abuse it 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.430
 let's say you decide to put some 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.709
 amount of money and inventory 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.180
 Well, playing the action through the team is not 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.209
 nobody canceled 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.169
 in this team we have to describe what 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.549
 put money in your inside pocket 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.720
 I hope that this system is clear and 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.050
 understandable as of March 13th screw 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.930
 You can put the following boxing things 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.940
 phone gun ammo and some 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.060
 other 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.910
 this is not a jointly incomplete list of things 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.890
 which can will be put in inventory 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.660
 closer to the opening list will replenish 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.790
 finally but at this stage 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 development team can not enable 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.610
 all things in inventory due to lack of 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.300
 I would like to have some other systems 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.190
 talk about the advantages of this system 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.140
 tape recorder he's a boombox you can 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.380
 buy at your nearest store or 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.940
 buy it to a friend of another player for 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.130
 lovers of criminal roles 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.500
 the developers have introduced the opportunity to steal 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.840
 or forcibly select a tape recorder from 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.220
 player will be able to listen to music 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.320
 any point of our state 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.150
 clicking on the boombox will open you some 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.000
 menu where you can make 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.280
 various actions take him boxing in hand 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.500
 In this case, the volume of the box throne will be 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.260
 attached to your arm as 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.360
 boombox on the ground including music which 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.410
 will be heard to you and other players 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.660
 bobox range 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:40.390
 having finished listening to music all with ease 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.390
 be able to raise his land and take in hand 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.530
 such a system allows you to implement 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.450
 really large-scale fascinating and 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.160
 exciting parties and parties 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.919
 Now we will remind about the weapon in the inventory 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.140
 This system is convenient because it is received 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.180
 or already acquired and will need 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.790
 manually drag and drop into inventory 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.770
 will explain as soon as you get any 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.919
 weapons she automatically and carry 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.500
 inventory along with ammo also 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.600
 once again without climbing a screw you can 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.580
 still switch having already 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.759
 your on 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.639
 using the mouse wheel if you 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.349
 fired all ammunition from your weapon 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.780
 they will not disappear anywhere 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.000
 you can charge it at any time 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.090
 having cartridges of the desired callibra 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.729
 which means you don't have to 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.969
 buy new weapons every time when 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.919
 he ran out of ammo well and last 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.830
 today you can throw 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.840
 already anywhere in the state on earth and in 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.270
 In this case, the vector is already 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.960
 thrown on the ground attach to the ground and 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.659
 you can raise any player on this 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.330
 sweet note i finish the third edition 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.460
 developer diaries running ahead 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.830
 I will say that the next fourth issue 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.080
 will be devoted to the topic of cars 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.080
 thanks for watching stay with us
