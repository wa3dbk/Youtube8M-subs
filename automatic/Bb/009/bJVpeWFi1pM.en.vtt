00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
toolkit we should attend to is the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
toolkit we should attend to is the
driver<00:01:00.239> installation<00:01:01.129> now<00:01:02.129> there's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> step

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
driver installation now there's a step

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.889 
driver installation now there's a step
by<00:01:02.670> step<00:01:02.910> walkthrough<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.539> that'll<00:01:03.809> help

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
by step walkthrough here that'll help

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.750 
by step walkthrough here that'll help
you<00:01:04.049> uninstall<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.710> existing<00:01:05.220> possibly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you uninstall any existing possibly

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399 
you uninstall any existing possibly
faulty<00:01:06.150> drivers<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> install<00:01:06.900> fresh

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
faulty drivers and install fresh

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
faulty drivers and install fresh
compatible<00:01:08.250> ones<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.299> key<00:01:09.479> step<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
compatible ones the key step here is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
compatible ones the key step here is
step<00:01:10.350> number<00:01:10.380> three<00:01:10.979> though<00:01:11.220> will<00:01:11.850> key<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.180> on
