 Choi Sung Lee grotty 32 addition s 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 This time, one els is included Escobar due to making short game once 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:30.149
 I 'll try it. So I have 30 years to get to Ping. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.329
 You can try it first , then the next. 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.329
 4 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:53.350
 Fine short game is also how the lapping another brief look Yorkshire 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:57.820
 To the article Why I like the one with that process shots so self out of 1 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 One of the reasons is that even if you use a short one, 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.449
 Try 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:11.290
 Yes This enters the backswing that much of this same kid can do 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:18.400
 He is a kid up there it continues the pattern of both rods to swing this place 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:24.790
 Because of this hasineunde the left shoulder down so ttaun a different feeling 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:30.310
 Rather than to keep my boat to keep this intact four times so far doesimyeon 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:36.640
 I keep this 4 and I feel like a color ball and not a little 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:39.460
 Naturally ahead in the rear tteolrimyeon body aside As she so 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.580
 I have to come in . 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.390
 I'm going forward, so balance goes back like this 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 Catching the balance because in this situation it is buried in one body 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.680
 There are 222 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.860
 A little bit of level 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.700
 Yes it is down 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.650
 Level- aligned club headed slightly upward feeling 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.900
 So I would like to do when you strangely when I came to write as naturally leads 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:12.010
 And in the process 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:15.510
 1 us When the child wiggles to the look, the success wins to the left wrist 2 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.230
 Naturally because of weight 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.870
 Please drop it in the front, and the process will be zero. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.849
 When you are a little tired, 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 It's a nose . Forking comes in. 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.310

 Well do you like your coming now, 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:59.600
 Something that is not right knee so I used doeneunge used in the next 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.780
 When you look at the side as the child goes out, this is not used in the future . 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.780
 I will. 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.640
 That's right, so this way you'll lose weight in the future . 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.569

 It is to inflate the wrist 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.690
 This is not going away, it's close to power. 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.980
 Yes, once again. 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.050

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.500
 Having to recall my actual gentle mine 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.209

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:25.070
