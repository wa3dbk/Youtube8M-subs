00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 because the glp is a fuel is a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.339
 mix of butane and propane and has 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.410
 various applications one of them is 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.910
 for automotive for gas auto but 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.820
 It also has applications at the level 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.980
 industrial home heating- and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.529
 good although its acronyms are glp gas 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.890
 liquefied petroleum 60% of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.460
 production comes from natural gas wells 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 Well, mainly the advantages are two 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 an economical economic advantage the glp 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.870
 is usually half the price of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 liter of gasoline and another advantage 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 mainly good environmental 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.079
 can install or is installing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.060
 mainly in gasoline vehicles and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.680
 they have to be vehicles from 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.060
 euro that comply with the regulations of 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
 euro 3 emissions this means 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.160
 normally cars from 2001 and 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.739
 usually gasoline for example in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.500
 four cylinders the price is 1850 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.239
 massive with indirect injection in the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.339
 case in direct injection engines 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.280
 we have an extra cost of 100 euros is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.170
 say it would be in massive 1950 just 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.509
 no the team is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.210
 95% is the same the only difference 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:19.310
 is that to cool the injector in the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 direct injection we have to in certain 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.909
 turning speeds at low revolutions and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 high revolutions we have to inject 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.330
 a little gasoline in order to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.860
 cooling the injector is not always 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.590
 loses the guarantee if for the most part 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.689
 of the cases the manufacturers obviously 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.700
 they touch the engine and good they lose 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.200
 the engine guarantee go with gas 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.659
 effectively for those cases in the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.240
 we work with new vehicle and not 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 lose the guarantee what we do is 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.539
 cover with us with insurance in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.500
 this case a groupama insurance we cover 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.530
 the complete engine in case the glp could 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 cause any damage to the engine that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.830
 it's not usual at all but good for 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.049
 least if we keep that guarantee there 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.470
 the maintenance cost in our 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.020
 case is a son is made every 30,000 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.000
 kilometers and the cost are 39 euros each 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.940
 revision is a revision that are changed 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.830
 a few filters is a test of 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.560
 tightness and a configuration is made 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.850
 of a reconfiguration of the system the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.470
 glp is cheaper than fuels 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.720
 traditional gasoline 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 Diesel diesel for two reasons 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.910
 one because in and of itself the product is already 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 cheaper and another important part of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.470
 that price reduction are obviously 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.020
 taxes are very difficult that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.600
 raise taxes because it's a 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.040
 clean fuel the cities to everything 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.660
 big cities of madrid barcelona 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 Seville have major problems of 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.250
 pollution and this fuel helps 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.770
 significantly reduce those 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.670
 air quality problems then 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.530
 from my point of view it is an opinion 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.680
 personal but come on I'm convinced 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.580
 that glp taxes will not go up 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.290
 precisely for this reason because 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.570
 it is a clean fuel and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.120
 cities are really interested in this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.400
 fuel if they can work a 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.470
 petrol vehicle with glp is a vehicle 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.560
 bifuel this means that it uses gas 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.280
 or gasoline indistinctly the vehicles 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.140
 diesel can work with glp and it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.570
 they would call dual fuel vehicles that he wants 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.730
 say this that both inject the two 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.030
 fuels we need to continue 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.950
 injecting diesel to the engine and also a 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.810
 part of the fuel would be glp the 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.350
 problem that we find here is the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.950
 2 to 2 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.459
 the more 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.220
 the ratio that the maximum more or less to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.440
 that we can get is 70 percent 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 of diesel and 30 percent of glp with 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.099
 which there is saving is no longer so 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.620
 significant but engines do work 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.730
 with diesel with gps are virtual engines 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.730
 who use the two fuels
