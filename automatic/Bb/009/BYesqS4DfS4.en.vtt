Hi, I’m Craig, but you can call be eye bags,
and this is Mental Floss on YouTube. Today,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.000
I’m going to answer bored during school’s
big question, “Why do we get dark bags under

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.920
our eyes when we’re tired?”

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.300
I don’t know if you know this, bored during
school, but your username goes really well

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.360
with your question. Maybe you do know, maybe
you don't. I don't know!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.010
Anyway, dark circles and eye bags are actually
two different things. If you get dark circles

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.570
under your eyes, you can thank your genes
in addition to tiredness. As for bags, those

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.910
are a combination of a few different things.
Things we will discuss, after this intro.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.050
Let’s get started!

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.899
First, let’s talk about what’s actually
going on under your eyes. The skin itself

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.159
is very thin. And it covers muscle, fatty
tissue, and blood vessels. But, as you might

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.389
remember from our episode on whether or not
deoxygenated blood is blue, the blood of light-skinned

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.170
people often appears bluish to us.
So, how dark that area appears has a lot to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.620
do with skin color and thickness. And there’s
the additional darkness that comes with genetics

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.229
in some people.

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.690
One popular theory as to why they stand out
more when we’re tired is that blood vessels

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.979
have grown in size. When someone is tired,
their cortisol production increases, which

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.149
results in more blood and larger blood vessels.
Another possibility is that blood increases

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.530
in that area just from laying horizontally
all night.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.479
What about the bags, though? Well, we’re
not really sure. It hasn’t been well-studied

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.520
yet. There seems to be a correlation with
age. For a long time, it was believed that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.170
as people get older, the fat that used to
sit in the skin underneath the eyes moved

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.270
into new spots in the body.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.420
But, a study done in 2008 showed that the
fat under the eyes actually experienced an

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.350
INCREASE in volume. So, older people will
have more bags under their eyes whether or

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.170
not they’re tired. Still, tiredness will
make them even more noticeable because water

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.969
fills up the fatty tissue in the under-eye
area. The same thing happens when someone

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.579
eats a lot of salt or has allergies. Or goes
like *this*.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.189
Gravity also affects the eyes with time. I
know it affected me -- when I saw that movie,

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.579
I was like *WOW*.
Now with actualy gravity, tissues just start

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.590
to droop a little more. Because of that, experts
also recommend not lying flat in bed.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.569
Thanks for watching Mental Floss on YouTube,
which is made with the help of these nice

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.949
bags. If you have a Big Question of your own
that you’d like answered, leave it below

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.720
in the comments. See you next week!
