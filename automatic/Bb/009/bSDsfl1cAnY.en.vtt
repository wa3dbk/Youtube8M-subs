00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.980 

and<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.370> reason<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.850> use<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.270> project<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.840> line

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
and the reason I use a project to line

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.750 
and the reason I use a project to line
the<00:02:57.140> bottom<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.590> keep<00:02:57.920> my<00:02:58.340> hair<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.640> place

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.290 
the bottom is to keep my hair in place
and<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.750> give<00:02:59.990> me<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> more<00:03:00.680> defined<00:03:01.130> brow<00:03:01.490> so

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
and to give me a more defined brow so

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960 
and to give me a more defined brow so
that's<00:03:02.660> really<00:03:03.260> what's<00:03:03.650> gonna<00:03:03.950> do<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.400> for

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
that's really what's gonna do that for

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.000 
that's really what's gonna do that for
you<00:03:05.030> if<00:03:05.420> that's<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.930> look<00:03:06.410> you're<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.830> for

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

an<00:03:07.880> eyeshadow<00:03:08.270> alone<00:03:08.840> can<00:03:09.740> do<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.160> but<00:03:10.490> it's

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
an eyeshadow alone can do it but it's

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.510 
an eyeshadow alone can do it but it's
just<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.180> lot<00:03:11.330> easier<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:11.989> way<00:03:12.230> at<00:03:13.100> this<00:03:13.310> point
