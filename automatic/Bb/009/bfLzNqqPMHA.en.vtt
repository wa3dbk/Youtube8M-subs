00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 and so hello everyone today we will 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:12.269
 change our mob FSB avnire as 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.580
 known in the source of the game 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.230
 only available spawner pigs and we 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.520
 can solve this problem with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.970
 command block 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.609
 we will need if you play on 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 server, you just need to be admin 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.660
 have abc u also do it all in 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.690
 creative and if you play single 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 the game you just need to go to the creative 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.590
 so let's get started this is the call team 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.300
 this is the team that changes our spawner 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.600
 it was he who wanted to say by this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.610
 This coordinates xyz for example as if 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.579
 spawner make 5 blocks above your 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.890
 command block you prescribe 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.680
 the corresponding team from the team 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.360
 block as i want to appear on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.700
 command block here on and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.210
 in place of the command block, it is quite 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.159
 I am here not to change anything now here here 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:23.630
 here we write our both of you 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:29.960
 let's recognize the cow and how we will protest 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 We see as our cow has appeared 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:49.590
 let's put here and how we see ours 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:54.270
 the boxes are already spawning and so let's get started 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 Further for those who had enough 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 learn how to change 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 It is the spuner that you can no longer look 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.929
 further will be revealed how to urge 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:10.739
 zombie horse and a couple of small buns 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.769
 so let's get started the first team is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:20.870
 calls a zombie horse and also calls 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:26.180
 skeleton zombies let's call this and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.180
 call our 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.130
 doesn't want to fly and so now let's 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.510
 try to tame them by 100 as we 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.600
 filled and as we see them we can not 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.690
 we ca nâ€™t tame them either 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.100
 no way to install the saddle 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.090
 to solve this problem to us 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.050
 will need 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.400
 of a slight change exactly in the team 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:04.090
 add and mystery one is already tamed 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.209
 precisely tamed already so we now 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:17.270
 get rid of all the excess we take all 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:19.940
 but so let's get this horse 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.740
 we can ride it and we 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.959
 we can install everything on it 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.700
 we can't armor it 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:36.590
 set and here is our horse 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 recognized as so it acts on 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:47.180
 our horse skeleton and also we can 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.840
 set a hundred on it and also we can 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.840
 ride 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.920
 also wanted to show you such here 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.920
 a small bun now 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.630
 we can do also call on zombies 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:27.900
 our zombie 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:30.660
 giant and so and so wanted more 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.560
 say all these commands here are 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.870
 call horses giant as well as various 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.229
 mobs we can register 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:48.960
 their team this amount for example now 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:52.770
 let's call our creeper here we are 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.020
 called our object as we see and also 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.669
 we can all call these mobs 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.229
 exactly zombie horse zombies skeleton 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.860
 giant and still we can call and 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:10.789
 without command blocks exactly change 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.080
 spavner we we can just change 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.840
 spavner we can only with the help 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.970
 command block of all other mobs 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:23.360
 overtone we can exactly call through 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.360
 console and 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.210
 and so thank you all for watching all bye 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.210
 until
