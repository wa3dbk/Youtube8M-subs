00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 hello people welcome back to one 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.509
 taxi xy today I want to tell you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 or we explain in the 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.240
 witcher 2 assassins of kings in the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.730
 enhanced edition the crash to desktop 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.359
 could fix user complain 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 that the game is just in the middle of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.140
 play without an error message 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.440
 smacks and then you land on his 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.580
 desktop you can actually right 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.860
 just fix it 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.329
 the community has a patch for it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 developed but now I show you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 first of all just like her 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:54.269
 You can navigate errors 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 first to your steam folder steam steam 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:02.189
 apps then you should now have here 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.739
 somewhere the witcher 2 is here it is 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:09.570
 beautiful 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:12.090
 then you look at pc and where have 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 we just because it is the file without 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 underlined this is my backup file 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.390
 I have to look here now 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.010
 Do we have them there since this file makes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.450
 the German constitutional problems because the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.780
 does not seem to sound right in the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 game loaded pure and so one 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.850
 buffer overflow or what knows 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.980
 Something is there at the place 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 badly programmed and the subtitles 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.590
 lead in the enhanced edition of the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.250
 witcher 2 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.510
 that the game just back on 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.400
 the desktop flies without one 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.030
 error message 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.030
 the problem in the enhanced edition 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.370
 Usually occurs when you crate 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 opened acts or goes through doors 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.610
 and then you end up again 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.440
 on the desktop and that's natural 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 not desirable for me and so can 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.549
 you do not play what you like me too 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.490
 paid and just play there 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.960
 the edition was without stallion so without 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.940
 the extended constitution or the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.159
 improved version he said there was 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.190
 actually better but long talk 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.830
 short sense now first to fix her 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.310
 goes on a browser of your choice then 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.310
 give her german crash 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.390
 hotfix everything clear 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.950
 which then gives you the best one because 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.270
 the hit also lands at the top and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.640
 you can just click on it here 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 There it clicked and here it is 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 someone did the job i dont know 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.970
 as he approached these files 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.340
 is because you can actually do this 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.610
 Do not replace files like that now if you can 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.670
 for example, here with notepad + + 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.590
 or something so he has to open the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.560
 reason xml already had and could 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.710
 because the de strings file is new from it 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.040
 So everybody made that whole thing 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.890
 which here thanks to inside 89 is called the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.560
 I have this patch I say now 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.890
 that's what this motto is all about 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.090
 play becomes playable again so you go 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 here on if downloads the file 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.660
 then we can do that best too 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.290
 of course you have to log in 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.030
 his 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.200
 quite clear but how to get one 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.020
 website logs in that i need now 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.670
 not explain that is of course that 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.990
 Everybody should be clear how to look 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.690
 Logs in somewhere and to the file 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.180
 download so the file is ready 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.090
 downloaded and now you navigate to 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 this file and unzip it to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.250
 example with winrar is a rar file 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.650
 no zip but rar files can be quite 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.930
 just with racing eg impact so 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.910
 and here is the file that we 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.070
 Now you can easily replace 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.710
 take this file and into the the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.510
 witcher directory when copying not 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.820
 navigate ag again 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.770
 So where to get that file you can 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.290
 has to copy down is must 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.140
 following the following the following ort namely 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.370
 in the spam folder because I know that 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.930
 unfortunately not where you have installed 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.140
 but mostly you have it right on one 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.799
 plate then thrown in steam apps 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:22.120
 came now have to look for two 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.860
 that 's the way pc looks and zack here 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.960
 you have to throw in so you have to 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.900
 they always replace but I would always 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.160
 recommend as I have already here 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.050
 before a backup of the basic file 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.569
 To create that is, if you again 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.689
 back volt and the 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.879
 et cetera again want to have it like that 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.409
 from the game so with error if you like that 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.330
 the game was gonna stop then 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.909
 would hurt but if he so the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.429
 then you can always do a backup of 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.529
 file for example in underscore 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:51.659
 then you just select files 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:55.020
 set goals and then you can do that 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:05:00.899
 play as normal as always in yours 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:03.509
 start library and it will not 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:06.300
 more of that infamous crash to desktop 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.439
 you can come after that without 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.270
 to play problems 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.919
 I hope I liked the video 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.990
 if yes load thumb or abo da 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.680
 that's it for me today your taxi 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.680
 launcher
