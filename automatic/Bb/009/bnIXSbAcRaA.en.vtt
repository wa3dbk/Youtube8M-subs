you guys can easily do that by going to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.060 
you guys can easily do that by going to
so<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.240> display<00:02:46.870> brightness<00:02:47.910> all<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.150> way<00:02:49.209> up<00:02:49.390> I

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
so I display brightness all the way up I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.990 
so I display brightness all the way up I
didn't<00:02:51.070> do<00:02:51.190> much<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:51.790> mean<00:02:52.060> well<00:02:54.000> actually

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
didn't do much but I mean well actually

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.850 
didn't do much but I mean well actually
I'm<00:02:55.330> going<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:56.610> close<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.880> light<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> we

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
I'm going to close to the light so we

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.270 
I'm going to close to the light so we
got<00:03:00.130> our<00:03:00.989> terrain<00:03:01.989> which<00:03:02.350> we<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.800> zoom<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.000> on

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
got our terrain which we can zoom in on

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.020 
got our terrain which we can zoom in on
you<00:03:06.280> can<00:03:06.400> get<00:03:06.520> real<00:03:06.700> close<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:08.260> see<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:09.030> can't

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
you can get real close to see it can't

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.070 
you can get real close to see it can't
really<00:03:10.570> see<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.180> say<00:03:13.420> we<00:03:13.600> get<00:03:13.750> real<00:03:13.930> close

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
really see it so say we get real close

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.030 
really see it so say we get real close
we<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.470> zoom<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:15.209> on<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:20.830> zoom

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
we can zoom in on it and then we zoom

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.140 
we can zoom in on it and then we zoom
out<00:03:21.660> come<00:03:22.660> back<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.550> what's<00:03:24.550> going<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.790> happen

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
out come back so what's going to happen

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.090 
out come back so what's going to happen
is<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:28.300> can<00:03:28.510> run<00:03:28.750> towards<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.470> we'll<00:03:30.010> get

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
is you can run towards it so we'll get

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.330 
is you can run towards it so we'll get
up<00:03:30.480> you're<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.660> pick<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> dive<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.860> do

what I just picked one so he's going to

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.590 
what I just picked one so he's going to
run<00:03:38.739> towards<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.910> turns<00:03:40.120> green<00:03:40.330> we're

run towards it and it turns green we're
going<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.810> jump<00:03:41.050> when<00:03:41.200> I'm<00:03:41.320> hold<00:03:41.560> it<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.970> we're

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
going to jump when I'm hold it in we're

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.890 
going to jump when I'm hold it in we're
going<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.270> crush

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900

to<00:04:08.489> build<00:04:09.489> up<00:04:09.760> pc<00:04:11.159> terrain<00:04:12.159> just<00:04:12.609> comes<00:04:12.849> out

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
to build up pc terrain just comes out

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:29.710 
to build up pc terrain just comes out
from<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.269> ground

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:39.160

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
so let's start sylvain easy jump this is

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.870 
so let's start sylvain easy jump this is
not<00:05:13.280> gonna<00:05:13.460> be<00:05:13.580> easy<00:05:14.020> right<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:16.550> can<00:05:16.700> see

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
not gonna be easy right so you can see

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.950 
not gonna be easy right so you can see
you<00:05:17.780> can<00:05:17.900> see<00:05:18.110> at<00:05:18.230> different<00:05:18.590> angles<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:20.750> say<00:05:20.930> I

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
you can see at different angles so say I

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.070 
you can see at different angles so say I
know<00:05:21.200> like<00:05:21.410> this<00:05:21.590> I<00:05:21.620> can<00:05:21.830> see<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.070> front<00:05:22.340> I

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
know like this I can see the front I

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.159 
know like this I can see the front I
move<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.320> back<00:05:25.240> can<00:05:26.240> see<00:05:26.419> the<00:05:26.540> back<00:05:26.780> of

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
move this back can see the back of

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.620 
move this back can see the back of
course<00:05:27.440> it's<00:05:27.740> really<00:05:27.860> cool<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.490> think<00:05:29.180> stably

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
course it's really cool I think stably

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.770 
course it's really cool I think stably
cool<00:05:29.900> concept<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.130> can't<00:05:31.400> and<00:05:31.669> I<00:05:32.090> think

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
cool concept and I can't and I think

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
cool concept and I can't and I think
they're<00:05:33.140> just<00:05:33.320> these<00:05:33.620> games<00:05:33.919> just<00:05:34.190> for<00:05:34.510> demo

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800
