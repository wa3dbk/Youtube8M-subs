00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello very good to all written and in the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.510
 video that we are going to show you 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.730
 then you will see me accompanied by tyc 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.170
 and my clan mate who has 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.510
 been helping to do this well and the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 tutorial and in which we do not intend to 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.380
 nothing is the very technical thing but more 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.000
 well, we have to have things in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.489
 account while developing a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.320
 departure and if we mostly find ourselves 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.759
 with an enemy tank so by the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.169
 moment and assuming they do not change 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.790
 a lot of things when the game comes out 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.470
 We are definitely going to talk a 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.079
 little about the damage we can 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.970
 make a tank with the rpg from 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.510
 different angles and different areas 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.879
 in agreement 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 that said let's start with the front area 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.780
 both the upper and lower band 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.420
 of the tank since according to what we have 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.949
 tested we will need for both five 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.409
 species to meet our 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.780
 goal is worth as you are 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.399
 watching in the video in conclusion the area 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.309
 front with a 90 degree angle 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.559
 we will need the 5 rpg is worth and each 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.920
 one of them will be made between a 20 and 25 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.140
 of damage since inevitably almost 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.270
 we will never give in the same point and good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.250
 as a curious fact as you can be 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.140
 watching right now in the video is that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.090
 just one of the times we've 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.610
 recorded and that he has gotten normal 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.380
 of 50 percent help a book a 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.090
 key point the truth that we do not know 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.700
 because for much more than we have 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.990
 tried it has not come back to us but 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.610
 this does not end here many times 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.259
 we will have the opportunity to give him in that 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.819
 angle precisely to the tank then 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.459
 we will do the same damage of angle lion 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.319
 different because the answer is yes in 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.569
 this case taking an angle let's say 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.909
 about 30 or about 40 degrees 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.799
 let's say 30 so as not to get involved during 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.450
 all the video is worth it is proven that 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.030
 the damage even if it's not exactly the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.090
 same in each shot we will need 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.950
 5 rpg is to destroy the good tank 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 once we see the front we go to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.729
 see the lateral zone and it is that here they 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350
 let's teach the distances is valid for 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.850
 that you see that we do not lie about the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.700
 that does not matter the distance in which 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 let's shoot the rpg of a shot with a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.390
 initial angle of 90 degrees we're going to 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.550
 make a critical voucher and let's 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.040
 incapacitate it momentarily in this 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.250
 case as you can see we will need some 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.110
 3 rpg is to destroy the tank and good 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 we will need the same from another 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.100
 angle then not from the angle of 30 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.390
 degrees we will need the five 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.280
 special to take down the enemy 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.300
 so be aware of your 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.280
 position or that of the tank 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.630
 but let's see the back now to see 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 what do we find and is that here the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.830
 let's place the three distances of 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.140
 according to the average fence and far as well 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.900
 you will know already that in battlefield 3 the part 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.340
 most vulnerable of the tank was the third 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.410
 part of the picture is the same as 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.600
 agreement it is clear that we are going to 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 need two rpg is to destroy a 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.610
 tank be from the distance that is 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.920
 but let's not forget the angle to see 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.270
 what happens if it is not 90 then 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.560
 basically what you are seeing in the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.970
 video and in the first shot if 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.950
 remember in the above I left the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.950
 vehicle with critical damage thing that now 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.530
 with a minor angle is not even close to 50% 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.210
 that if we need a less species 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.850
 than in the previous cases of agreement 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.380
 at the back with at least one 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.650
 angle other than 90 degrees 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 we will need 4 rpg and good as no 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.950
 We wanted to leave nothing in the air too 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.950
 we have tested two more places with the rpg 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.330
 how are the turret and the caterpillar what 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.080
 effect will have a kind on the 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.670
 turret 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.500
 let's say that specifically targeting 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.690
 its basis well our logic we 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.150
 says little check and so 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.650
 as you see depend on 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.320
 we will need the five and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.640
 repetitions to tighten a tank 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.610
 shooting him only in the turret 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 from the front but what happens if not 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.720
 we have the tank frontally so the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.310
 it crosses you believe it or it does not change and it is that if 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.950
 the tank is looking to the side and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.010
 we just turn our back on the turret 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 if we shoot at the base we can make him 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.320
 critical damage to the vehicle leaving it to a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.630
 60 and 64 percent health and by 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.820
 so much we would only need 3 rpg is well 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.640
 given in addition if the turret moves and 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.959
 It is totally parallel with the tank 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.150
 we will also have the opportunity to 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.190
 to hurt him enough, come on, they wanted him 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.660
 make a critic and good the caterpillar though 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.670
 it looks like it or not is also a part 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.230
 important to keep in mind you can give 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.390
 the same result that we just 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.030
 comment with the turret giving it in the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.530
 let's say between quotes 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.690
 we will get a shot to make you a 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.370
 critical and leave it at about 66 per 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.040
 health cent according to an angle 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.930
 of 90 yes and therefore as in the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.280
 Previous we will need three mirrors 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.780
 to break it 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.310
 but this will not work if we do 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.250
 with an angle other than the one I've already 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.440
 saying 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.570
 in conclusion friends if we look at the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.610
 summary that we just put in the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.500
 video the thing is like this if we want 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.910
 hurt a tank and destroy it what 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.010
 soon as possible 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.350
 we will have to look for its backside and 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.720
 try to shoot the 2 rpg is with a 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.880
 90 degree angle already 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.940
 that we will do in channel 10 for a damage 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.800
 of 55 points and good the second option 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.150
 more profitable and perhaps more usual and more 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.370
 easy to find in a field of 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.040
 battle is to see a tank 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.110
 laterally we should take advantage of their 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.960
 vulnerabilities of both the urban and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.490
 of the turret as last we would have the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.640
 caterpillar within what they do more damage 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.160
 it's worth the other way as you see looking 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.960
 that less damage does we have because 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.930
 attacking a tank frontally be 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.790
 from whatever angle we go that neither 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.040
 I happen to you that so before 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.529
 I would start running and hide where 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.539
 I can 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.479
 and to attack the tank from a better 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.069
 position but good as you see the part 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.929
 back is still a little more 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.029
 vulnerable although we shot from 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.829
 another angle and still I think we'll have 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.449
 better options I hope you have 

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:36.879
 liked the video and you have learned 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.679
 as much as we do at least 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.749
 for people who were not very clear 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:42.489
 this concept about the rpg if the tank 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.139
 to see where they did more damage at least 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:46.149
 the moment remember that this is a beta 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.549
 and no wonder that in the version 

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.319
 end of the game can change it already 

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:53.019
 we would make a comparison if it would be the 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.199
 case a greeting from people and even the 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.199
 next
