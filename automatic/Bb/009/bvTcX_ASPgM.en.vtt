small packet left over because this is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.550 
small packet left over because this is
the<00:01:05.239> one<00:01:05.390> that's<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.840> be<00:01:05.900> rotating<00:01:06.140> in

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the one that's going to be rotating in

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.890 
the one that's going to be rotating in
your<00:01:06.710> hand<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.850> during<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.360> swing<00:01:08.689> cut

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
your hand so during this swing cut

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.990 
your hand so during this swing cut
instead<00:01:09.290> of<00:01:09.439> putting<00:01:09.740> it<00:01:09.830> right<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.070> top<00:01:10.460> what

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
instead of putting it right on top what

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.660 
instead of putting it right on top what
you're<00:01:11.150> doing<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:12.200> make<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.470> false<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:13.460> because

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
you're doing to make it false is because

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.550 
you're doing to make it false is because
we<00:01:13.790> got<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.030> ace<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.329> hearts<00:01:14.540> on<00:01:14.659> here<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.530> we

we got the ace of hearts on here so we

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.350
