after two obedia DAP ters and a lot of
patience<00:00:07.470> but<00:00:08.480> basically<00:00:09.480> what<00:00:10.260> happened<00:00:10.650> was

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
patience but basically what happened was

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:18.980 
patience but basically what happened was
I<00:00:11.820> bought<00:00:12.410> this<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:17.480> it<00:00:18.480> doesn't<00:00:18.869> really

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
I bought this one and it doesn't really

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.790 
I bought this one and it doesn't really
work<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:20.189> some<00:00:20.310> odd<00:00:20.430> reason<00:00:21.140> I'm<00:00:22.140> assuming

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
work for some odd reason I'm assuming

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.870 
work for some odd reason I'm assuming
it's<00:00:23.269> faulty<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.990> whatever<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.699> case

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's faulty or whatever so just in case

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
it's faulty or whatever so just in case
I<00:00:27.119> ordered<00:00:27.539> another<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.949> slightly

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I ordered another one which is slightly

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.330 
I ordered another one which is slightly
bigger<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> snotty<00:00:31.140> bulkier<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> blue<00:00:33.290> and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
bigger and snotty bulkier and blue and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.500 
bigger and snotty bulkier and blue and
for<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.520> odd<00:00:35.610> reason<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.239> isn't

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
for some odd reason this one isn't

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.190 
for some odd reason this one isn't
faulty<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:38.460> sure<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.809> there's

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
faulty so as I'm sure you know there's

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.420 
faulty so as I'm sure you know there's
no<00:00:40.350> real<00:00:40.500> quality<00:00:40.710> control<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.340> these

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
no real quality control with these

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.520 
no real quality control with these
