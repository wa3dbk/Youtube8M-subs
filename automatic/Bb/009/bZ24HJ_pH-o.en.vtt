sooner or later that backlog has got to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.649 
sooner or later that backlog has got to
work<00:04:22.710> its<00:04:22.950> way<00:04:23.190> through<00:04:23.219> the<00:04:23.520> system<00:04:23.820> that

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
work its way through the system that

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.629 
work its way through the system that
means<00:04:24.960> more<00:04:25.529> inventory<00:04:25.889> on<00:04:26.279> the<00:04:26.310> mark

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
means more inventory on the mark

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.149 
means more inventory on the mark
get<00:04:26.789> most<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:27.629> that<00:04:27.719> inventory<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.770> being<00:04:29.039> in

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
get most of that inventory not being in

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.100 
get most of that inventory not being in
very<00:04:29.370> good<00:04:29.520> condition<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.810> will

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
very good condition and that will

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.879 
very good condition and that will
continue<00:04:31.349> to<00:04:31.770> put<00:04:32.009> a<00:04:32.039> negative<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:33.319> a<00:04:34.319> native

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
continue to put a negative on a native

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
push on prices because of the excess

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.260 
push on prices because of the excess
inventory<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.400> I've<00:04:38.610> been<00:04:38.699> saying<00:04:38.999> for<00:04:39.210> a

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
inventory so I've been saying for a

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.760 
inventory so I've been saying for a
couple<00:04:39.569> of<00:04:39.599> months<00:04:39.689> I<00:04:40.110> think<00:04:40.409> we're<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.590> a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
couple of months I think we're in a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.830 
couple of months I think we're in a
little<00:04:41.009> window<00:04:41.219> of<00:04:41.580> opportunity<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.270> sellers

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
little window of opportunity for sellers

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.779 
little window of opportunity for sellers
with<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.259> market<00:04:43.620> rising<00:04:44.129> a<00:04:44.189> little<00:04:44.219> bit<00:04:44.580> I

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
with the market rising a little bit I

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.390 
with the market rising a little bit I
don't<00:04:45.449> expect<00:04:45.719> this<00:04:46.050> increase<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.830> continue

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
don't expect this increase to continue

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.999 
don't expect this increase to continue
for<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.939> much<00:04:48.210> longer<00:04:48.240> at<00:04:49.199> that<00:04:49.439> point<00:04:49.740> I

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
for that much longer at that point I

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.950 
for that much longer at that point I
expect<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.639> way<00:04:50.849> before<00:04:50.909> closures<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:51.749> hit

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
expect this way before closures to hit

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.230 
expect this way before closures to hit
the<00:04:52.529> market<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:53.039> depress<00:04:53.460> again<00:04:53.849> I'm<00:04:54.180> not

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
the market to depress again I'm not

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.659 
the market to depress again I'm not
really<00:04:54.810> sure<00:04:54.930> for<00:04:55.349> how<00:04:55.379> long<00:04:55.710> but<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.370> think

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
really sure for how long but I think

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.670 
really sure for how long but I think
we've<00:04:56.849> got<00:04:57.029> another<00:04:57.330> lull<00:04:57.810> in<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.319> market

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
we've got another lull in the market

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.499 
we've got another lull in the market
before<00:04:59.009> we<00:04:59.219> really<00:04:59.580> dig<00:04:59.969> out<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.389> this

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
before we really dig out of this

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.110 
before we really dig out of this
long-term<00:05:00.840> problem<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.770> we've<00:05:01.919> had

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
long-term problem that we've had

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.269 
long-term problem that we've had
hopefully<00:05:03.120> I'm<00:05:03.300> wrong<00:05:03.469> but<00:05:04.469> that's<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.889> only

00:05:05.269 --> 00:05:05.279 
hopefully I'm wrong but that's the only

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:07.909 
hopefully I'm wrong but that's the only
way<00:05:05.460> I<00:05:05.490> can<00:05:05.699> interpret<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.509> numbers<00:05:06.919> so

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
way I can interpret the numbers so

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.529 
way I can interpret the numbers so
