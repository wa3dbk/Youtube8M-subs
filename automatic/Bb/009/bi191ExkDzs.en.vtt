00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
my iPhone says that backup failed

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.650 
my iPhone says that backup failed
because<00:00:24.769> iCloud<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.010> full<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.449> full

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
because iCloud is full and the full

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
because iCloud is full and the full
pop-up<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.349> show<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> usually

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
pop-up that will show up and it usually

pop-up that will show up and it usually
happens<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:31.170> probably<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> morning

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
happens you probably see in the morning

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.510 
happens you probably see in the morning
when<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> wake<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> here's<00:00:35.070> why

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
when you wake up so here's why

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.540 
when you wake up so here's why
number<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:35.969> iTunes<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.440> iCloud<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.399> have

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
number one iTunes or iCloud if you have

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
number one iTunes or iCloud if you have
your<00:00:38.700> iCloud<00:00:39.149> turned<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.960> recommend

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
your iCloud turned on which I recommend

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940 
your iCloud turned on which I recommend
that<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:41.239> it's<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.870> way<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.469> phone<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that you do it's a way for your phone to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
that you do it's a way for your phone to
backup<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.520> Apple<00:00:44.910> servers<00:00:45.180> every<00:00:45.750> night<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
backup to Apple servers every night so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
backup to Apple servers every night so
the<00:00:46.890> phone<00:00:47.039> has<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.430> plugged<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.200> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the phone has to be plugged in it has to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.279 
the phone has to be plugged in it has to
be<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.620> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> has<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.690> locked<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
be on Wi-Fi and it has to be locked and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.590 
be on Wi-Fi and it has to be locked and
then<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.039> automatically<00:00:53.789> backup<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
then it will automatically backup to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
then it will automatically backup to
Apple<00:00:54.960> servers<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> question<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> what

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
Apple servers so the question is what

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
Apple servers so the question is what
happens<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.730> that's<00:00:59.820> full<00:01:00.180> okay<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
happens when that's full okay well the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.720 
happens when that's full okay well the
first<00:01:01.530> thing<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.640> would

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
first thing that would you would

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
first thing that would you would
normally<00:01:03.149> expect<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> pay

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
normally expect to do is have to pay

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520 
normally expect to do is have to pay
because<00:01:05.159> Apple<00:01:05.820> says<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.049> buy<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.409> more

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
because Apple says you can buy some more

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130 
because Apple says you can buy some more
space<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:08.189> five<00:01:08.400> gigs<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> want

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
space you get five gigs and if you want

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
space you get five gigs and if you want
more<00:01:10.320> than<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
more than that it's so much I think I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.310 
more than that it's so much I think I
pay<00:01:12.590> $20<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.799> 15<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.640> 20<00:01:14.970> bucks<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.360> year<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.869> 15

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
pay $20 for 15 to 20 bucks a year for 15

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.010 
pay $20 for 15 to 20 bucks a year for 15
gigs<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:18.080> for<00:01:20.090> iPhones<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.450> an<00:01:21.570> iPad

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
gigs now I have for iPhones and an iPad

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.060 
gigs now I have for iPhones and an iPad
on<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.869> plenty<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.830> why

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
on it I think and it's plenty so why

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.630 
on it I think and it's plenty so why
would<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.549> phone<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.560> backing<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
would one phone be not backing up and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.310 
would one phone be not backing up and
not<00:01:29.759> work

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
not work

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.420 
not work
well<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:30.980> number<00:01:31.850> one<00:01:32.090> answer<00:01:32.690> is<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:34.190> you

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
well the number one answer is that you

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.090

that Apple R it has on their servers
they<00:01:59.840> can<00:02:00.020> go<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.320> get<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:00.979> version

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
they can go and get that it was version

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.660 
they can go and get that it was version
at<00:02:01.490> any<00:02:01.640> time<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.830> only<00:02:03.979> thing<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.460> have

in the most real one if you want more

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.880 
in the most real one if you want more
than<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.209> last<00:02:53.420> thousand<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.080> be<00:02:54.200> backed<00:02:54.409> up<00:02:54.620> I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
than the last thousand to be backed up I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.309 
than the last thousand to be backed up I
typically<00:02:55.879> will<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.450> dump<00:02:56.629> my<00:02:56.810> photos<00:02:57.200> on

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
typically will go and dump my photos on

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.479 
typically will go and dump my photos on
my<00:02:57.470> computer<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.250> couple<00:02:58.819> times<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.180> month<00:02:59.330> and

my computer a couple times a month and

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.660 
my computer a couple times a month and
so<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.519> don't<00:03:02.209> need<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.330> backed<00:03:02.599> up<00:03:02.840> now<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
so I don't need it backed up now the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.479 
so I don't need it backed up now the
iCloud<00:03:04.970> does<00:03:05.209> backup<00:03:05.599> your<00:03:05.780> video<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:07.250> that's

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
iCloud does backup your video but that's

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.509 
iCloud does backup your video but that's
a<00:03:07.640> lot<00:03:07.879> does<00:03:08.599> a<00:03:08.629> lot<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.379> space<00:03:09.739> you're<00:03:10.190> talking

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
a lot does a lot of space you're talking

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.910 
a lot does a lot of space you're talking

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
that over in no time so I turn that off

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.000 
that over in no time so I turn that off
and<00:03:18.980> every<00:03:19.970> time<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> take<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.599> video<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:21.799> of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and every time I take a video but of

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.589 
and every time I take a video but of
course<00:03:22.220> I'm<00:03:22.340> taking<00:03:22.489> off<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.970> video<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.510> I'm

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
course I'm taking off to video so I'm

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.839 
course I'm taking off to video so I'm
dumping<00:03:23.900> them<00:03:24.200> regularly<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.670> can

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
dumping them regularly but you can

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.420 
dumping them regularly but you can
probably<00:03:26.030> again<00:03:26.890> empty<00:03:27.890> them<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.310> your

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
probably again empty them to your

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.089 
probably again empty them to your
computer<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:29.060> couple<00:03:29.420> times<00:03:29.629> a<00:03:29.780> month<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.500> if

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
computer a couple times a month now if

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.970 
computer a couple times a month now if
your<00:03:31.280> phone<00:03:31.459> gets<00:03:31.640> broken<00:03:31.940> or<00:03:32.510> stolen<00:03:32.840> yes<00:03:33.709> you

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
your phone gets broken or stolen yes you

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
your phone gets broken or stolen yes you
would<00:03:34.099> either<00:03:34.220> brick<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.640> would<00:03:34.760> lose<00:03:34.970> that

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
would either brick you would lose that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.530 
would either brick you would lose that
data<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.590> another<00:03:37.430> thing<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.819> you<00:03:37.879> can<00:03:38.030> do<00:03:38.209> is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
data so another thing that you can do is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.149 
data so another thing that you can do is
you<00:03:38.750> can<00:03:38.930> not<00:03:39.049> use<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> cloud<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:39.890> can<00:03:39.980> use

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
you can not use the cloud you can use

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.339 
you can not use the cloud you can use
your<00:03:40.250> computer<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:41.420> will<00:03:41.599> still<00:03:41.930> sync<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.319> your

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
your computer it will still sync to your

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.430 
your computer it will still sync to your
computer<00:03:42.920> automatically<00:03:44.290> while<00:03:45.290> you're

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
computer automatically while you're

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.789 
computer automatically while you're
sleeping<00:03:45.920> we<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.790> set<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:47.480> iTunes<00:03:47.799> so

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
sleeping we can set that up in iTunes so

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.080 
sleeping we can set that up in iTunes so
that's<00:03:48.950> another<00:03:49.190> option<00:03:49.459> if<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.790> just<00:03:49.940> want

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
that's another option if you just want

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.550 
that's another option if you just want
to<00:03:50.150> backup<00:03:50.299> your<00:03:50.480> computer<00:03:51.049> a<00:03:51.079> lot<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.319> people

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
to backup your computer a lot of people

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.319 
to backup your computer a lot of people
don't<00:03:52.250> have<00:03:52.340> computers<00:03:52.879> anymore<00:03:53.090> they<00:03:53.299> have

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
don't have computers anymore they have

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.930 
don't have computers anymore they have
iPads<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:53.930> iPhones<00:03:54.190> so<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.459> would<00:03:55.700> still<00:03:55.910> use

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
iPads and iPhones so I would still use

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.440 
iPads and iPhones so I would still use
the<00:03:56.090> cloud<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:57.790> would<00:03:58.790> say<00:03:58.970> if<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.269> have

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
the cloud and I would say if you have

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.629 
the cloud and I would say if you have
video<00:03:59.720> that's<00:03:59.989> so<00:04:00.319> important<00:04:00.919> that<00:04:01.459> you're

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
video that's so important that you're
