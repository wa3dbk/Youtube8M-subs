00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.929
 what made me want 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.599
 to become an actress I remember there is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 a show yet it's not at all 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.489
 really the kind of show that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.290
 I will see today but had a 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:26.070
 show that played a role 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.869
 it's straw hat italy 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 labiche it was maybe national 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.739
 place rogier it was at the van era 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 kessel I think so it was early 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.489
 90's 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.510
 I think alas I was going I believe for the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 second or third time at the theater 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.949
 but this is the first time that one 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.160
 removes full sight and makes it what 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.739
 hit me in this show this is the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 rhythm and changes of scenery I 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.730
 said to me after the communication 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.249
 I want to do theater and after all 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.569
 these condensed I started a little bit 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.210
 to write I started doing the 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.469
 music at the same time I play what I 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.739
 think she's all acquired these cities 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.890
 have lived I do not know if I can say 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.620
 that the world inspires me the world makes me 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.880
 scared it's really I'm not 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.630
 confident about the world and I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
 can say that it's someone pretty 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.450
 pessimistic it is undoubtedly this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.120
 fear of the world of the future that me 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.520
 fact that makes me act and that gives me 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.440
 today want to develop projects 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.040
 work and develop projects 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.140
 personal 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.230
 in general I put myself in the room with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 the technicians with my team and I 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.970
 know that I have half an hour to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.850
 take something 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.010
 and then I pick up some ideas 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
 some some ideas of the structure 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.360
 of lipovetsky gilles frozen and hop I them 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.000
 operators putting my words in the place 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.070
 I'm getting dressed up thinking makes it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 much more anecdotal what by posing 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 questions 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.870
 so that's how it becomes 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.220
 theatrical at the level of writing but 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.310
 after there is the music that comes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.470
 bring there 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.210
 the poetic touch he always has more 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.119
 more abstract that which allows 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.450
 breathe as a bit as the viewer 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.860
 can also provide its own 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.399
 answers and that it's not me who 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.049
 answer 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.390
 but that he can make his way 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.220
 so all alone I send you as 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.260
 sheep in the midst of wolves will be held at 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.060
