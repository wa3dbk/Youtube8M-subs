00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
for parties it's really important to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.080

keep<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> low<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.050> try<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.190> much

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.570 
keep it on a low and try not to do much
stuff<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> always<00:02:17.530> see<00:02:17.830> myself<00:02:18.040> getting

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
stuff but I always see myself getting

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.800 
stuff but I always see myself getting
into<00:02:19.030> some<00:02:19.810> tricks<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.440> stuff<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:22.480> get

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
into some tricks and stuff I do get

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.860 
into some tricks and stuff I do get
bored<00:02:23.110> quite<00:02:23.680> quick<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.300> really

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
bored quite quick and so I just really

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.780 
bored quite quick and so I just really
can't<00:02:25.900> let<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.560> track<00:02:27.070> play<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.490> do<00:02:27.580> nothing

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
can't let the track play and do nothing

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.360 
can't let the track play and do nothing
with<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.740> you'll<00:02:29.740> see<00:02:29.950> some<00:02:30.160> stuff

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
with it so you'll see some stuff

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.620 
with it so you'll see some stuff
probably

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.910 
my eye I do have for every song I have
few<00:02:53.210> points<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> first<00:02:54.020> break<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
few points on the first break and the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.970 
few points on the first break and the
second<00:02:55.310> break<00:02:55.490> and<00:02:56.050> every<00:02:57.050> time<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> mix<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.860> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980

new track I program those on a few
points<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:02.690> decide<00:03:03.050> whenever<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
points and so I can decide whenever the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.980 
points and so I can decide whenever the
new<00:03:04.310> brake<00:03:04.580> is<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> whenever<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.510> new<00:03:05.660> track

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
new brake is and whenever the new track

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.210 
new brake is and whenever the new track
comes<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.740> I<00:03:07.580> think<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.960> most<00:03:09.200> thing<00:03:09.740> the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
comes in and I think the most thing the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.700 
comes in and I think the most thing the
thing<00:03:10.400> I'm<00:03:10.580> used<00:03:11.060> most<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.630> those<00:03:12.290> memory

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
thing I'm used most is those memory

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.120 
thing I'm used most is those memory
cards<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.460> end<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.700> loop<00:03:13.880> functions<00:03:15.130> I'm

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
cards and the end the loop functions I'm

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.440
