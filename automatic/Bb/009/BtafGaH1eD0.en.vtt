00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.139
 our channel infor meter in which 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 now we want to show you after 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 have explained how to make a 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.340
 installation within windows dÃ­az 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 mobile app android tal 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.560
 which without making any modification 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.539
 Well we want to show how that 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.029
 performance is what is going to offer these 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.070
 applications then on a phone that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 well we can consider today 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 quite modest as can be the nokia 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.659
 Lumia 920 we have installed some 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 applications like twitter games and 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.519
 another photo application at 500 pixel and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.790
 Well, let's start, for example 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.790
 so it is the twitter application 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.360
 as we can see there is a small 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.079
 screen when it 's charging and good 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.679
 here we have it 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.679
 we can go to our last 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.190
 tweets and access good to the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.480
 notifications for example 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.480
 to the different messages 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.719
 we can write we can access the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.789
 settings what is an application then 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.549
 practically complete and good 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.679
 quite functional and the only thing is that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.209
 good notifications in real time 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.119
 they will not work because he does not have 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:39.069
 google services what second form 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.899
 I would need a modification that 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.060
 the developers will do but as 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.799
 you can see the operation is pretty 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.360
 pretty good for example let's be able to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.870
 try 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.090
 to choose a photo 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.990
 to see if they work 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.140
 and we can access that with what application 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 I can choose 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.850
 that that photo 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.009
 how can you check the operation 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.340
 it's pretty good the scroll that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.750
 He needs a little fluency but 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.510
 good to keep in mind that they are the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.629
 test versions as it is not nothing 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.629
 wrong 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.709
 is given for example we tested 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.709
 the game the candy class alone 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.260
 that today is not available in the 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.260
 windows home platform 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.510
 as we can check and do at 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.890
 sound 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.890
 and the operation 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.650
 full escobar do not use it 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.600
 None of the Google services as 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.600
 It's pretty pretty good 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.540
 Well, play too much 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.189
 but as you can see it's a game 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.189
 fully functional 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.810
 and well, there will be some 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.930
 another application 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.390
 For example, we can add one more 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 demanding 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.030
 in this to be able to check is played 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.030
 in horizontal 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.730
 and well it takes a little while to load but 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.500
 the game works 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.200
 as you can see 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.990
 it is possible good then 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.360
 has done a good job microsoft 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.900
 in which good because it manages to emulate 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.889
 all the environment of 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.979
 of an Android application 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.340
 yes, but in windows you are 10 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.340
 mobile 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.820
 and finally we are going to try other 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.820
 Applications 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.700
 month 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.180
 working more than correct taking 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:07.580
 note that they are a trial version 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.580
 and a terminal like columbia to 920
