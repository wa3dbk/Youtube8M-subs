drop off start statistic that you guys
see<00:00:15.870> free<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> gun<00:00:16.349> from<00:00:16.500> zero<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.290 
see free the gun from zero to that
number<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:17.670> where<00:00:17.820> we're<00:00:17.939> looking<00:00:18.150> at<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
number that's where we're looking at the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.420 
number that's where we're looking at the
max<00:00:18.480> damage<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.320> max<00:00:19.619> damage<00:00:19.860> from<00:00:20.160> zero

max damage so I'm max damage from zero
to<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> drop-off<00:00:21.030> start<00:00:21.390> statistic<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.170> go

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to the drop-off start statistic to go

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
to the drop-off start statistic to go
take<00:00:22.440> three<00:00:22.680> bolts<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.010> kill<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.250> either<00:00:23.400> gun

take three bolts to kill with either gun
okay<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.510> look<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> min<00:00:25.080> damage

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410

okay and we look at the min damage
that's<00:00:25.650> from<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> drop<00:00:26.400> off<00:00:26.550> n<00:00:26.760> statistic<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
that's from the drop off n statistic to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
that's from the drop off n statistic to
infinity<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> take<00:00:28.830> six

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
infinity and it's going to take six

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.679 
infinity and it's going to take six
bolts<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> kill<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> CBJ<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> seven<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.660> the

zigzag<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.689> hip<00:01:30.959> fire<00:01:31.289> is<00:01:31.649> like

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
zigzag but the hip fire is like

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:34.039 
zigzag but the hip fire is like
extremely<00:01:32.669> vertical<00:01:33.389> you<00:01:33.779> know<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.020> funny

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
extremely vertical you know it's funny

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.109 
extremely vertical you know it's funny
because<00:01:34.289> when<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.560> look<00:01:34.679> at<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.889> stats<00:01:35.249> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
because when you look at the stats the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.749 
because when you look at the stats the
CBJ<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.259> much<00:01:37.439> trumps<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.889> k7<00:01:38.429> in<00:01:38.490> almost

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
CBJ pretty much trumps the k7 in almost

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.459 
CBJ pretty much trumps the k7 in almost
every<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.719> when<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.869> actually<00:01:40.020> look<00:01:40.319> at

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
every way but when you actually look at

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.190 
every way but when you actually look at
the<00:01:40.499> gun<00:01:40.859> handling<00:01:41.929> you're<00:01:42.929> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.139> see

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the gun handling you're going to see

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.979 
the gun handling you're going to see
that<00:01:43.349> the<00:01:43.409> k7<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.159> easier<00:01:44.459> to<00:01:44.520> handle<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.840> at

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:45.989 
that the k7 is easier to handle so at

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.029 
that the k7 is easier to handle so at
the<00:01:46.049> end<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.319> video<00:01:46.469> going<00:01:46.739> to<00:01:46.829> need<00:01:46.919> to

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
the end of this video going to need to

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.679 
the end of this video going to need to
make<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.279> decision<00:01:47.759> what's<00:01:48.149> better<00:01:48.419> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
make the decision what's better the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.779 
make the decision what's better the
handling<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:50.159> able<00:01:50.219> to<00:01:50.340> kill<00:01:50.489> enemies

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
handling or be able to kill enemies

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.039 
handling or be able to kill enemies
quicker<00:01:50.999> I<00:01:51.270> don't<00:01:51.450> I'll<00:01:51.509> leave<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
quicker I don't I'll leave that to you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260 
quicker I don't I'll leave that to you
anyways<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:52.859> with<00:01:53.069> grip<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.819> can<00:01:53.999> see<00:01:54.239> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
anyways now with grip you can see that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.379 
anyways now with grip you can see that
the<00:01:54.419> k7<00:01:55.169> shooting<00:01:56.069> hit<00:01:56.609> far<00:01:56.789> as<00:01:56.939> well<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> a

the k7 shooting hit far as well as a

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.629 
the k7 shooting hit far as well as a
ds's<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.649> centered<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.549> know

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
ds's it's just really centered you know

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.129 
ds's it's just really centered you know
what<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.789> mean<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.989> you're<00:02:01.079> a

it's<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.539> nice<00:02:03.719> tight<00:02:03.989> little<00:02:04.200> circle<00:02:04.529> here<00:02:04.889> as

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it's a nice tight little circle here as

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.309 
it's a nice tight little circle here as
Arsene<00:02:05.399> ad<00:02:05.999> asks<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.689> get<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> really<00:02:07.289> good

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
Arsene ad asks you get a really good

Arsene ad asks you get a really good
perimeter<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.280> exactly<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> want

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
perimeter which is exactly what you want

with<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.569> full<00:02:09.780> bullets<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> sense<00:02:10.439> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
with the full bullets in the sense that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.970 
with the full bullets in the sense that
it's<00:02:10.769> it's<00:02:11.069> very<00:02:11.310> tight<00:02:11.579> good<00:02:12.450> hip<00:02:12.750> fire<00:02:13.019> with

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
it's it's very tight good hip fire with

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.450 
it's it's very tight good hip fire with
the<00:02:14.069> CBJ

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
the CBJ

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.970 
the CBJ
not<00:02:15.850> bad<00:02:16.060> both<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.990> hipfire<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.560> well<00:02:17.740> as<00:02:17.860> the

not bad both the hipfire as well as the

not bad both the hipfire as well as the
EDS<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.610> nice<00:02:19.060> tight<00:02:19.360> grouping<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.140> moves

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
EDS a nice tight grouping that moves

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.670 
EDS a nice tight grouping that moves
vertically<00:02:21.210> pretty<00:02:22.210> solid<00:02:22.720> I'd<00:02:22.900> give<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.350> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
vertically pretty solid I'd give it a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.140 
vertically pretty solid I'd give it a
pretty<00:02:24.190> good<00:02:24.250> rating<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.030> mean

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
pretty good rating you know what I mean

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.760 
pretty good rating you know what I mean
there's<00:02:25.570> having<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> huge<00:02:26.050> difference<00:02:26.320> looking

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
there's having a huge difference looking

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.060 
there's having a huge difference looking
at<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.920> CBJ<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.600> grip<00:02:28.840> versus<00:02:29.680> without

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
at the CBJ with the grip versus without

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.340 
at the CBJ with the grip versus without
the<00:02:30.220> grip<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> that's<00:02:31.930> something<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.140> keep<00:02:32.260> in

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
the grip so that's something to keep in

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the grip so that's something to keep in
mind<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:32.860> right<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:32.980> we're<00:02:33.160> gonna<00:02:33.250> be

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
mind but right now we're gonna be

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.570 
mind but right now we're gonna be
looking<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:33.730> rapid<00:02:34.360> fire<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.960> rapid<00:02:35.470> fire<00:02:35.710> with

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
looking at rapid fire so rapid fire with

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.300 
looking at rapid fire so rapid fire with
the<00:02:37.060> k7<00:02:37.900> again<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.200> see<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> top

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
the k7 again we see it going to the top

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.460 
the k7 again we see it going to the top
right<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:40.420> if<00:02:40.540> ours<00:02:40.720> pretty<00:02:40.990> good<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
right but if ours pretty good it's a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.950 
right but if ours pretty good it's a
nice<00:02:41.860> perimeter<00:02:42.370> as<00:02:42.520> we<00:02:43.270> saw<00:02:43.480> with<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> grip

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
nice perimeter as we saw with the grip

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.430 
nice perimeter as we saw with the grip
with<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.680> CBJ<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.970> mean<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:46.960> just<00:02:47.050> it's

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
with the CBJ I mean it's just it's

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.720 
with the CBJ I mean it's just it's
vertical<00:02:47.710> man<00:02:48.190> both<00:02:48.490> ad<00:02:48.790> s<00:02:49.060> hipfire<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:49.930> just

vertical man both ad s hipfire it's just

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.670 
vertical man both ad s hipfire it's just
almost<00:02:51.730> out<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> control<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.930> kind<00:02:53.560> of

almost out of control you know kind of

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.660 
almost out of control you know kind of
unusable<00:02:54.070> almost<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:55.060> extremely<00:02:55.870> vertical

unusable almost I'm extremely vertical

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.040 
unusable almost I'm extremely vertical

look at the CBJ pretty much the same

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.520

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.990 
yeah a little too vertical for comfort
with<00:03:44.410> steady<00:03:44.650> aim<00:03:44.800> all<00:03:45.010> we<00:03:45.160> see<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.370> ad<00:03:45.520> s<00:03:45.760> very

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
with steady aim all we see the ad s very

with steady aim all we see the ad s very
vertical<00:03:46.270> hip<00:03:46.900> fire<00:03:47.110> though<00:03:47.260> pretty<00:03:47.590> good<00:03:47.830> you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
vertical hip fire though pretty good you

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.500 
vertical hip fire though pretty good you
know<00:03:48.040> studying<00:03:48.730> doesn't<00:03:48.970> necessarily<00:03:49.390> make

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
know studying doesn't necessarily make

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.570 
know studying doesn't necessarily make
less<00:03:49.780> recoil<00:03:50.020> but<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.470> tightens<00:03:50.890> up<00:03:51.070> the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
less recoil but it tightens up the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.010 
less recoil but it tightens up the
crosshair<00:03:52.210> so<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.480> way<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.690> have<00:03:52.780> more

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
crosshair so that way you have more

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.110 
crosshair so that way you have more
bolts<00:03:53.380> going<00:03:53.710> in<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.980> center<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.940> cross

at<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.600> I'm<00:03:55.780> saying<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.410> we<00:03:56.500> shouldn't

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
at you know I'm saying so we shouldn't

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.350 
at you know I'm saying so we shouldn't
see<00:03:56.830> too<00:03:57.010> much<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.430> difference<00:03:57.820> with<00:03:58.240> the

see too much of a difference with the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.810 
see too much of a difference with the
actual<00:03:58.720> recoil<00:03:59.590> patterns<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.460> you<00:04:00.520> know<00:04:00.610> as<00:04:00.730> I

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
actual recoil patterns but you know as I

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
nice tight grouping on the k7 um they

nice tight grouping on the k7 um they
know<00:04:06.910> on<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.210> CBJ<00:04:07.660> look<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.930> said<00:04:08.110> although

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
know on the CBJ look I said although

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.020 
know on the CBJ look I said although
it's<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.650> tight<00:04:08.890> grouping<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.520> lot<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.730> bolts

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
it's a tight grouping so a lot of bolts

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.100 
it's a tight grouping so a lot of bolts
are<00:04:10.120> going<00:04:10.420> down<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> center<00:04:10.990> of<00:04:11.020> the

as 80s so you know moral story is if you

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.020 
as 80s so you know moral story is if you
have<00:04:46.629> studying<00:04:47.379> grip<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:47.949> hip<00:04:48.430> fire<00:04:48.639> on<00:04:48.759> you

have studying grip and hip fire on you

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.460 
have studying grip and hip fire on you
don't<00:04:49.180> be<00:04:49.270> getting<00:04:49.449> those<00:04:49.539> bowls<00:04:49.780> out<00:04:49.930> really

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
don't be getting those bowls out really

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.180 
don't be getting those bowls out really
fast<00:04:50.710> tight<00:04:51.280> abs<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.300> nice<00:04:52.479> tight<00:04:52.990> hip<00:04:53.949> fire

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.520 
fast tight abs and a nice tight hip fire
so<00:04:54.639> it's<00:04:55.150> actually<00:04:55.330> really<00:04:55.629> not<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> bad<00:04:56.050> combo

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
so it's actually really not a bad combo

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.529 
so it's actually really not a bad combo
I'd<00:04:56.650> probably<00:04:56.979> go<00:04:57.370> with<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.580> k7<00:04:58.090> overall<00:04:58.389> but

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
I'd probably go with the k7 overall but

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.399 
I'd probably go with the k7 overall but
the<00:04:58.629> CBJ<00:04:59.199> isn't<00:05:00.039> a<00:05:00.159> bad<00:05:00.520> option<00:05:01.259> so<00:05:02.259> right<00:05:02.380> now

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
the CBJ isn't a bad option so right now

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.809 
the CBJ isn't a bad option so right now
I<00:05:02.500> got<00:05:02.650> some<00:05:02.830> grasp<00:05:03.190> upon<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> screen

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
I got some grasp upon the screen

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.189 
I got some grasp upon the screen
essentially<00:05:04.240> going<00:05:04.360> over<00:05:04.569> the<00:05:04.659> information<00:05:04.840> I

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
essentially going over the information I

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.270 
essentially going over the information I
broke<00:05:05.409> down<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.650> beginning<00:05:06.009> of<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.159> video

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
broke down the beginning of the video

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.790 
broke down the beginning of the video
and<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:06.669> is<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.030> drop-off<00:05:07.569> start<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.319> drop

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
and that is the drop-off start and drop

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.010 
and that is the drop-off start and drop
off<00:05:08.949> end<00:05:09.360> distances<00:05:10.360> so<00:05:10.539> you<00:05:10.630> can<00:05:10.810> see<00:05:10.990> that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
off end distances so you can see that

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.749 
off end distances so you can see that
right<00:05:11.259> here<00:05:11.319> we<00:05:11.650> have<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.889> distance<00:05:12.370> on<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
right here we have the distance on the

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.879 
right here we have the distance on the
x-axis<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.659> you<00:05:13.810> know<00:05:13.930> say<00:05:14.139> on<00:05:14.289> this<00:05:14.470> graph<00:05:14.740> we

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
x-axis and you know say on this graph we

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.770 
x-axis and you know say on this graph we
have<00:05:14.979> the<00:05:15.069> Bulls<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.460> kill<00:05:15.639> on<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.030> y-axis<00:05:16.210> you

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
have the Bulls to kill on the y-axis you

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.689 
have the Bulls to kill on the y-axis you
guys<00:05:16.930> can<00:05:17.169> see<00:05:17.380> exactly<00:05:18.039> what<00:05:18.310> I<00:05:18.340> talked<00:05:18.580> about
