00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hello you two this is Mars row another

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.000 
hello you two this is Mars row another
train<00:00:05.250> update<00:00:05.700> but<00:00:06.000> uh<00:00:06.029> I've<00:00:06.569> decided<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.710> to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
train update but uh I've decided not to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.959 
train update but uh I've decided not to
go<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.189> o<00:00:08.610> gauge<00:00:08.880> anymore<00:00:09.480> because<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
go with o gauge anymore because the

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.539 
go with o gauge anymore because the
digital<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.660> expensive<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.679> Gorman<00:00:14.070> h/o

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
digital is so expensive some Gorman h/o

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
digital is so expensive some Gorman h/o
and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.179> started<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.750> these<00:00:15.929> two<00:00:16.260> Backman

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
and I started out with these two Backman

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.800 
and I started out with these two Backman
engines<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.789> start<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.359> because

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
engines just to start out with because

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.970 
engines just to start out with because
i'm<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.320> familiar<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.510> digital<00:00:21.510> command

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
i'm not familiar with digital command

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.429 
i'm not familiar with digital command
but<00:00:22.980> i<00:00:23.010> did<00:00:23.340> get<00:00:23.580> any<00:00:24.300> digitrax<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.609> far<00:00:26.910> i

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
but i did get any digitrax so far i

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.569 
but i did get any digitrax so far i
guess<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.250> pronounced<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:31.109> know

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
guess that way it's pronounced you know

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.590 
guess that way it's pronounced you know
so<00:00:32.579> i<00:00:32.910> am<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.540> started<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.579> and

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.569 

personal<00:00:39.600> power<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:43.010> engine<00:00:44.010> 3<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
personal power it on and engine 3 is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.139 
personal power it on and engine 3 is
this<00:00:44.820> Backman<00:00:45.660> switcher<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this Backman switcher right here which I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
this Backman switcher right here which I
haven't<00:00:48.420> been<00:00:48.510> able<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.989> program<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.469> number

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
haven't been able to program a number

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680 
haven't been able to program a number
into<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.250> won't<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> number<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.420> i<00:00:51.480> don't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
into it won't take a number so i don't

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110 
into it won't take a number so i don't
know<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
know if it's just it if it's just this

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.660 
know if it's just it if it's just this
switch<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.260> i<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:55.710> no<00:00:56.039> problem

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
switch or not because i had no problem

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.610 
switch or not because i had no problem
program<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.539> cxx<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:59.100> number<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.520> 44<00:00:59.940> 02<00:01:00.620> but

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
program that cxx the number is 44 02 but

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
program that cxx the number is 44 02 but
you<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> side<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.359> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you see on the side but I just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
you see on the side but I just
programmed<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> 44<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
programmed it 44 because I have

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.230 
programmed it 44 because I have
grandchildren<00:01:06.710> little<00:01:07.710> grandchildren<00:01:08.250> so
