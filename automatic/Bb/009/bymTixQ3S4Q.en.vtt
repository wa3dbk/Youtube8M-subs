looks like all right so this is the box
it<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.910> smartphone<00:00:25.910> robot<00:00:26.480> I<00:00:27.760> assume<00:00:29.470> these<00:00:30.470> are

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
it a smartphone robot I assume these are

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.090 
it a smartphone robot I assume these are
directions<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.020> just<00:00:33.230> stuff<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.590> shows<00:00:33.890> you

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
directions and just stuff it shows you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.660 
directions and just stuff it shows you
can<00:00:34.220> do<00:00:34.370> with<00:00:34.490> it<00:00:34.670> on<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.660> side<00:00:36.670> experience

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670
