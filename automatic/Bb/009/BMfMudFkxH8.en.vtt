00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello my see them play what's this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.540
 we hit today and tomorrow 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.790
 today we are going to sew the nina dress 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.000
 okay it's made up of what 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 so it consists of a front and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 so it's closed by little ones 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.650
 ties to the neck a little in tail of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.289
 rat and there will be ticket so like 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.929
 celikkol gold there we chose to put the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.510
 grege in front we can do what we want 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.340
 we can put the rose in front of the ass and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
 pink sandstone there are other combinations 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 this model it is done here in treatment 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 which is pretty transparent so it's 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 rather to put on a swimsuit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.690
 in other models it will be done in 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
 other tissues that may have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 less transparency in a first 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.620
 time it is netting the four sides 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.969
 we are sure to spin all four sides because 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 we chose to sew 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.920
 opening the sides so now looking forward 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 to this rib culture and to 1 cm for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 the side seam it will be necessary to do 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.420
 attention to one thing is that evolved 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.869
 with the screen there is half a centimeter of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 more wind between the two notches because 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.350
 that there is a little bit of purpose for 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.270
 place the chest between the two notches 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.439
 from before there is this enemy and the two 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.240
 back notches there are seven 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280
 it will be necessary to put pins as 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 screen and then forehead it's very very 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 slightly for the purpose it is a small 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 very simple model and in this fabric 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.759
 crepon on this case there is no sense 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.430
 so we made our side seams at 1 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.729
 cm and then we ironed by opening the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 sewing so we have the top of the front 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.070
 and there we put the bias in the sleeve 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.390
 so had the bihan cut it in half and 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.399
 so that they are less broad which we 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.460
 remains more than 2 cm wide of the ticket 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.850
 and there we put it on the edge we are friends cm 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.740
 from the edge 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 we see that there is half a centimeter of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 rose that exceeds we will have folded our 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.250
 bias on 1 8 cm is that at the beginning 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.430
 they were edge to edge we folded the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.560
 well and we made a sting at a bit 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.960
 close to 0.5 edge so that's it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.509
 well the sleeve on and that's the little 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.030
 sting that we just made to 0.5 in 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.039
 below then we flip the bias on it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 shoot twice and did not ask 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.080
 before forehand 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.060
 We already have 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.070
 sewn each other in hand on how one 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870
 see here so the result it gives us 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.550
 this one place because there we see 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.170
 conditions the extent on where one 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.660
 does not see the bias because he 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.120
 was very fine we asked our bias 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.580
 as we said here now we 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.770
 prepare the duet hem that will have the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.210
 slide so you went back from 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.180
 how much 05 of 0.5 and after yeah we have 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.820
 folded of 2 we have two and a half so we have 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.400
 returned from a half and we will sting or 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.180
 that we will pique my reviews here the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.070
 rib it's right edge is launched to 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.680
 0.05 of the chord that makes it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.110
 should leave us about 1 cm at 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.230
 flat medium we're upside down we have 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.550
 makes the ribs edge and topstitching to 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:07.920
 0.5 which gives who will do the same 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.510
 thing on the milk so the saion did 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.310
 both sides of the front and back one will 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.110
 tackling the bottom hem to the bottom 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.860
 robine so we made a hem 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.760
 by reversing 1 cm then 1.5 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.709
 you do not ask if you want to build otherwise 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
 we make an overstitch directly at 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.570
 same edge here for the version in 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.780
 polka dot polyester and the same thing for the 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.470
 all in here in broderie anglaise that we 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.130
 ended with a hem always 1 cm 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.140
 plus one and a half centimeters for water there 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.690
 there was no time yet to do 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.760
 this little band from the top we will do 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.850
 the terminal in the bias of the same fabric and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.470
 this is the model finish this zoom that is 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.070
 quentin so these tapes are provided 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.660
 in the kit 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.930
 we must prepare them we will see how 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.360
 fold our band of biec and 3 cm on 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:02.700
 was filled into two not revert to 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.650
 close another fold of the strips 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.040
 tip on a centimeter marks a little to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.739
 loulle 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.310
 then we will lose on a half 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.500
 lapel centimeter goes then folded 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.390
 until half until trek we have 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.890
 marked with iron so we mark a little to 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.870
 the water must not go further than 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.549
 half earlier to mm in less and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.850
 now not branded the same 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.290
 way that we already have 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.790
 do as you train lapointe he 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.570
 do not have to go out like that 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.210
 not that that sort 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.210
 we cheat a little when we fold here 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.130
 we go down a little bit so that when we 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.050
 folds one is sure not to go out 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.510
 he has a little crushed offered tension not 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 you want a little by little less of the 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.880
 half for it to be well regular there right 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.070
 it's perfect 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.600
 when we have to iron on both sides 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.600
 we will then folded 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:02.199
 we check that we have a small space between 

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:03.939
 the two for him of thongs so that's it 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.909
 the little links we made that 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.189
 will serve for the high he has red united 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.349
 in this version there is no bias 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.629
 of trade there is ticket for them 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.249
 armholes that are made in the 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.199
 same fabric as the garment that are 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.239
 also provided with the kit of course 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.629
 to complete each of these models that 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.489
 it's the plain rina like here 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:27.189
 in red color or embroidery 

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:30.219
