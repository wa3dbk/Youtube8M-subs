00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:24.500
 Hi Omura who is Woodpecker 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:27.529
 Yes, this is a car to introduce this is our racer alto works 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.960
 Temporarily speaking of grade r rsz 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.149
 a just 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.120
 This is an altoworks of hk, but the engine is f 6 a twin cam 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.010
 We are replaced 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.550
 Yes 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.739
 First to from the exterior 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 Let's see it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.989
 It becomes surprisingly sober person when the candidate is going to ne circuit I'd look flashy 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:06.000
 I received some minor changes, but it may change again from now on 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.330
 Please call me when I saw it on a circuit with something like this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330
 Yes 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.570
 a Of course the same design is also here- 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.840
 Yes 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.160
 This is it actually that darker and I look to in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.160
 It is carbon bonnet 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.650
 We paint the same color as the body slightly to clear 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.250
 It seems like I tried to clock some lights as the spirits left 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.450
 Well this is a target 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.630
 Is it feeling 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:00.770
 It's like tow hook or something like this 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:05.240
 It is that necessities in that race If you decide that the course out, anywhere even in the way it is disturbed 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.680
 Here if so hung with that book in that it does not go and does not lower when early because 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.660
 In feeling that please take the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.360
 Entered was 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.660
 If you look at a small child, you will see Belo and this is usually said 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.660
 Yes 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.350
 Let's just look at the engine for a moment 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.350
 Hmm 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.050
 Ah 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.830
 Yes I do not meet 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.610
 I agree 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:52.590
 Of course, I am so-so air cleaner outside the company's often said from the intake and exhaust 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.690
 It is as it is a child I intercooler 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:01.870
 This also has been found 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.850
 And this has instead put on here if or Hey Gurokue twin is as I said earlier 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.120
 Ne 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.180
 It is for turbine wagon r wide 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.640
 ht 07 one of those 07 turbines 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.640
 It is a one-off product also tomorrow want to de 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.750
 But I think that turbines do not know even if it sees Nechotto from so much look 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.940
 Once again we have a little behalf of the larger 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.180
 It is a big guy in, of course it is the cooling system data also aluminum 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.819
 It is hot water kura 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.749
 After all 4 Management is here to because the most important thing 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.749
 It is a double item 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.580
 Yes 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.380
 It looks a bit over the theme, so it's a food exaggeration 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.300
 This Suzuki made of sports 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.150
 It becomes a thing 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.299
 Pillow upper left and right a fact angle is I'm slightly different 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.299
 Of course is it on that setting 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.780
 a And I do not seem- 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780
 ben 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.310
 Of course, I was saying that decorated it a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.310
 There is nothing 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.079
 I guess is around there is usually of not in the car fire extinguisher in reverse 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.620
 In here 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.580
 This one 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.270
 That's the kind of fuel you open 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.980
 1 driver other than the driver 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 It is the seat 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.780
 Here seat belt of the 5-point because it does not get stuck because it is that fixed 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.840
 Say staff is open 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.009
 It is for 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.260
 Day 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.520
 A Te 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.520
 Let's turn on the switch for a moment 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.820
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.040
 I do not have grandchildren There is no speed meta 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.280
 Scolded do 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.280
 stay 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.070
 There is a type 6 tachometer tree attached- 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.470
 Hmm 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.750
 me 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.750
 There is no need for mead . 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.090
 The after it is a place to go regularly absence 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.550
 Ring 's 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.840
 I think that you will install 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.840
 Me quit 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.030
 It is the biggest feature of this car after 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.030
 Hard to I I 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.450
 It is good here 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.310
 It is a full spot better how much easy-to-understand 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.310
 Made from white body 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.420
 I am waiting for the full spot 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.620
 Yes 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:29.319
 At a Kato, you open the fuel cover like that. 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.319
 It may be like nori together but this is it 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:41.810
 This is also life saving and so on 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.810
 It can be opened from the outside 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:51.100
 Running 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:51.100
 The damper is pulled out so as not to open even if it is open 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.250
 These details are also important in that race 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.250
 I'm waiting
