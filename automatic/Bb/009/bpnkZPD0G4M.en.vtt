to<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.489> think<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:09.120> sort<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.049> breaks

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
to be and I think that sort of breaks

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.280 
to be and I think that sort of breaks
the<00:03:10.590> bond<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.760> necessary<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:15.290> establish

the bond it's necessary to establish

that kind of intimacy and Trust is there

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.680 
that kind of intimacy and Trust is there
any<00:03:20.069> point<00:03:20.579> in<00:03:20.700> time<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.090> look<00:03:21.390> at<00:03:21.569> an

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
any point in time that you look at an

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.080 
any point in time that you look at an
image<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.200> say<00:03:25.489> look<00:03:26.489> like<00:03:26.670> how<00:03:26.849> that's

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
image and say look like how that's

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.630 
image and say look like how that's
portraying<00:03:27.629> that<00:03:27.780> individual<00:03:28.709> or<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.459> does

portraying that individual or if does
anything<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.239> would<00:03:30.390> happen<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.580 

lose<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.640> process<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> making<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.870> image<00:03:37.140> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
lose the process of making the image and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.800 
lose the process of making the image and
then<00:03:37.739> there's<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.010> process<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.640> evidence<00:03:39.150> you

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
then there's a process of evidence you

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.140 
then there's a process of evidence you
know<00:03:39.870> my<00:03:40.079> goal<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.709> not<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.980> exploit<00:03:41.609> someone

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
see a picture that that I think would

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.059 
see a picture that that I think would
you<00:03:51.030> know<00:03:51.150> misrepresent<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.230> person<00:03:52.680> or<00:03:52.859> the

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
you know misrepresent that person or the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.360 
you know misrepresent that person or the
you<00:03:53.760> know<00:03:53.879> what<00:03:54.060> they're<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.450> through<00:03:54.629> I

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
you know what they're going through I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.440 
you know what they're going through I
won't<00:03:56.370> choose<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.849> in<00:03:56.970> my<00:03:57.120> anime

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
won't choose it in my anime

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.240 
won't choose it in my anime
but<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.050> think<00:04:00.260> it's<00:04:00.410> very<00:04:00.590> important<00:04:01.190> for

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
but I think it's very important for

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.030 
but I think it's very important for
people<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.700> understand<00:04:02.360> stuff<00:04:02.890> for<00:04:03.890> both

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
people to understand stuff for both

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.430 
people to understand stuff for both
publishers<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.060> public<00:04:05.480> understand

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
publishers and the public understand

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.740 
publishers and the public understand
because<00:04:06.860> someone<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.460> suffering<00:04:07.760> does<00:04:08.570> not

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
because someone is suffering does not

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.990 
because someone is suffering does not
mean<00:04:08.960> they<00:04:09.110> don't<00:04:09.290> have<00:04:09.440> dignity<00:04:10.070> because

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
mean they don't have dignity because

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.450 
mean they don't have dignity because
someone<00:04:11.570> is<00:04:11.720> poor<00:04:12.080> does<00:04:12.680> not<00:04:12.890> mean<00:04:13.100> they<00:04:13.250> don't

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
someone is poor does not mean they don't

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.690 
someone is poor does not mean they don't
have<00:04:13.640> to<00:04:13.820> do<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.740> in<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.860> way<00:04:16.070> someone<00:04:16.549> who's

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
have to do it in a way someone who's
