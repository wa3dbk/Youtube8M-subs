00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.321
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:09.421
round and round, round and round

00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:13.321
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.221
All day long

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.270
The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:22.421
Swish swish swish, swish swish swish

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.421
The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.420
All day long

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.970
The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep

00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.421
Beep beep beep, beep beep beep

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.821
The horn on the bus goes beep beep beep

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.420
All day long

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.970
The people on the bus go chatter chatter chatter

00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:52.421
chatter chatter chatter, chatter chatter chatter

00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.821
The people on the bus go chatter chatter chatter

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.420
All day long

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.970
The babies on the bus go wah wah wah 

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.421
wah wah wah, wah wah wah 

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.821
The babies on the bus go wah wah wah 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.020
All day long

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.970
The bell on the bus goes ding ding ding

00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.421
ding ding ding, ding ding ding 

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.821
The bell on the bus goes ding ding ding

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.020
All day long

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.570
The doors on the bus go open and shut

00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:38.221
open and shut, open and shut

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:42.121
The doors on the bus go open and shut

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.020
All day long

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.020
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.421
round and round, round and round

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.321
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:01:54.421 --> 00:02:02.221
All day long, All day long,
