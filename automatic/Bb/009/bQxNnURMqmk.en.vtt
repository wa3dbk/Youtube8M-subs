00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and basically the defense is to get in

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
and basically the defense is to get in
that<00:01:06.299> core<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> rage<00:01:07.979> spell

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
most of the gold and elixir is outside
of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> base<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.439> collectors<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of the base in the collectors and not in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
of the base in the collectors and not in
the<00:01:44.820> storages<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.840> there<00:01:45.990> are<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.200> pekka's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the storages so there are some pekka's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.170 
the storages so there are some pekka's
that<00:01:46.799> went<00:01:46.979> around<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> base<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:47.970> some

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that went around the base and there some

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.149 
that went around the base and there some
that<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.540> still<00:01:48.840> inside<00:01:49.259> taking<00:01:49.770> care<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that are still inside taking care of the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
that are still inside taking care of the
rest<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> base<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> other<00:01:51.420> ones<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
rest of the base but the other ones are

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
rest of the base but the other ones are
chopping<00:01:52.770> down<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.280> barracks

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
chopping down those barracks

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
chopping down those barracks
it<00:01:54.329> looks<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.020> Archer<00:01:55.470> Queen<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.860> down

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it looks like my Archer Queen is down

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
it looks like my Archer Queen is down
and<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.790> barbarian<00:01:57.719> king<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.170> still<00:01:58.320> alive

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and my barbarian king is still alive

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.700 
and my barbarian king is still alive
which<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.670> he<00:02:00.240> almost<00:02:00.719> has<00:02:00.960> full

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
which is really good he almost has full

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.469 
which is really good he almost has full
health<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.189> look<00:02:02.520> how<00:02:02.670> many<00:02:02.880> pekka's<00:02:03.299> are

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
health and look how many pekka's are

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
health and look how many pekka's are
left<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.860> surprising<00:02:05.040> they're

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
left this is really surprising they're

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.760 
left this is really surprising they're
so<00:02:05.969> opie<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.780> maybe<00:02:07.049> next<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.619> should

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so opie so maybe next time you should

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.260 
so opie so maybe next time you should
read<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.129> all<00:02:08.280> ten<00:02:08.550> Packers<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.119> next

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
read with all ten Packers in your next

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.110 
read with all ten Packers in your next
army<00:02:09.599> comes<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> three-star<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> a

army comes to get a three-star on a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.509 
army comes to get a three-star on a
ace<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.379> looks<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.830> there<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.310> some

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
ace so it looks like there are so some

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.149 
ace so it looks like there are so some
defenses<00:02:13.940> left<00:02:14.150> at<00:02:14.299> one<00:02:14.480> archer<00:02:14.930> tower<00:02:15.159> our

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
defenses left at one archer tower our

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.649 
defenses left at one archer tower our
Packers<00:02:16.549> are<00:02:16.670> getting<00:02:16.909> rid<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.120> all<00:02:17.450> the

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
Packers are getting rid of all the

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.589 
Packers are getting rid of all the
elixir<00:02:17.930> pubs<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.560> gold<00:02:19.040> mines<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.239> believe

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
elixir pubs and gold mines and I believe

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.839 
elixir pubs and gold mines and I believe
there<00:02:20.780> are<00:02:20.810> still<00:02:21.230> two<00:02:21.799> archer<00:02:22.220> towers<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
there are still two archer towers and

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.360 
there are still two archer towers and
one<00:02:23.450> cannon<00:02:23.930> left<00:02:24.260> after<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.010> one<00:02:25.159> was<00:02:25.340> just

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
one cannon left after this one was just

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.660 
one cannon left after this one was just
destroyed<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:27.049> only<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.829> 95<00:02:28.640> percent

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
destroyed and we only have a 95 percent

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.729 
destroyed and we only have a 95 percent
and<00:02:29.239> we're<00:02:29.420> looking<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.989> base<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.379> yeah<00:02:30.709> I

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
and we're looking at the base and yeah I

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.979 
and we're looking at the base and yeah I
was<00:02:30.860> correct<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:32.480> looks<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:32.780> they're

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
was correct so it looks like they're

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.960 
was correct so it looks like they're
going<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.230> make<00:02:33.379> their<00:02:33.560> way<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> opposite

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
going to make their way to the opposite

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.220 
going to make their way to the opposite
side<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.420> base<00:02:35.599> since<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.079> were<00:02:36.200> no

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
side of the base since there were no

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.710 
side of the base since there were no
troops<00:02:36.680> there<00:02:36.890> already<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.670> they're<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.569> in

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.569 
troops there already and they're just in
a<00:02:38.780> big<00:02:39.079> clump<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.860> looks<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.310> our

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
a big clump and it looks like our
