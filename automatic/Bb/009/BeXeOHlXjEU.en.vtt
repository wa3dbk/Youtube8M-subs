swear to God
bullshit<00:03:43.220> I'm<00:03:43.400> doing<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.269> quick<00:03:44.420> calculation

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
bullshit I'm doing a quick calculation

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.050 
bullshit I'm doing a quick calculation
to<00:03:45.350> work<00:03:45.500> out<00:03:45.709> what<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.010> probability<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.910> her

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
to work out what the probability of her

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.500 
to work out what the probability of her
getting<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.780> those<00:03:47.959> are<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:49.070> was<00:03:50.920> 5/11

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
getting all of those are so it was 5/11

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.440 
getting all of those are so it was 5/11
the<00:03:53.510> first<00:03:53.780> time<00:03:54.080> round<00:03:54.290> times<00:03:55.269> you<00:03:56.269> had

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
the first time round times you had

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.259 
the first time round times you had
worked<00:03:57.410> out<00:03:57.650> there<00:03:58.190> was<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.370> six<00:03:58.820> percent

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
worked out there was a six percent

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.050 
worked out there was a six percent
chance<00:03:59.690> that<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:00.320> would<00:04:00.470> hit<00:04:00.820> every<00:04:01.820> single

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
chance that you would hit every single

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.770 
chance that you would hit every single
one<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.780> row<00:04:03.019> from<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.190> start<00:04:04.540> why<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:05.599> that

one in a row from the start why is that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.990 
one in a row from the start why is that
well<00:04:06.680> what<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.190> means<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.490> battle<00:04:07.819> those<00:04:08.000> on
