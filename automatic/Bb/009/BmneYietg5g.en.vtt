especially for advanced players you want
to<00:00:49.720> be<00:00:49.840> able<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.050> drive<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.740> ball<00:00:50.920> with<00:00:51.160> a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
to be able to drive the ball with a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.430 
to be able to drive the ball with a
tight<00:00:51.520> spin<00:00:51.880> and<00:00:52.180> when<00:00:52.720> you<00:00:52.840> do<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.050> you're

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
tight spin and when you do that you're

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.530 
tight spin and when you do that you're
going<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.620> swing<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.670> racket<00:00:55.090> goes<00:00:55.240> more

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
going to swing and the racket goes more

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.660 
going to swing and the racket goes more
across<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.410> body<00:00:56.620> so<00:00:57.250> you're<00:00:57.340> going<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.520> focus

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
across the body so you're going to focus

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.730 
across the body so you're going to focus
on<00:00:57.940> going<00:00:58.120> across<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.930> body<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.320> your<00:00:59.410> swing

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
on going across the body with your swing

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.000 
on going across the body with your swing
instead<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.700> low<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.540> high<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.590> I'm<00:01:02.860> going<00:01:02.980> to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
instead of low to high so I'm going to

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.469 
instead of low to high so I'm going to
go<00:01:03.100> ahead<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.430> demonstrate<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:04.059> one<00:01:04.269> more

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
go ahead and demonstrate that one more

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.779 
go ahead and demonstrate that one more
time<00:01:04.509> for<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.080> but<00:01:05.290> basically<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.340> key<00:01:06.640> to

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
time for you but basically the key to

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.480 
time for you but basically the key to
driving<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.450> ball<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.899> to<00:01:08.409> swing<00:01:08.710> across<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
driving the ball is to swing across the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.239 
driving the ball is to swing across the
body<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.969> notice<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.780> my<00:01:10.990> hand<00:01:11.350> is<00:01:11.530> going<00:01:12.100> to

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
body and notice that my hand is going to

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.819 
body and notice that my hand is going to
turn<00:01:12.609> when<00:01:13.359> I<00:01:13.390> swing<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.049> not<00:01:14.259> going<00:01:14.499> to<00:01:14.590> stay

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
turn when I swing it's not going to stay

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.349 
turn when I swing it's not going to stay
like<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.609> it's<00:01:15.729> not<00:01:15.880> going<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.179> stay

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359 
like this and it's not going to stay

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.120 
like this and it's not going to stay
like<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:16.630> it's<00:01:17.229> actually<00:01:17.590> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.799> relax

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
like this it's actually going to relax

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.090 
like this it's actually going to relax
and<00:01:18.520> turn<00:01:18.969> and<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:19.810> add<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.170> last<00:01:20.619> element

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
and turn and then I add the last element

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.529 
and turn and then I add the last element
of<00:01:21.159> catching<00:01:21.609> the<00:01:21.700> racket<00:01:22.030> which<00:01:22.149> we'll<00:01:22.299> do<00:01:22.420> in
