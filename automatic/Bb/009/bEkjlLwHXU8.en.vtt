00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
gain knobs a girl grinded the overall

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
gain knobs a girl grinded the overall
gain<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> girth<00:01:29.970> knob<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
gain so the girth knob is more like a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.920 
gain so the girth knob is more like a
low<00:01:31.140> frequency<00:01:31.440> gain<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> an

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
low frequency gain so if you have an

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
low frequency gain so if you have an
eighth<00:01:34.080> string<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.190> download<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
low weight and low tunings and the grind

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.919 
low weight and low tunings and the grind
is<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:41.580> high<00:01:41.729> frequency<00:01:41.940> gain<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.569> could

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
is the high frequency gain which could

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.480 
is the high frequency gain which could
give<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> reel<00:01:44.280> one

of your of the amp before going to the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.430 
of your of the amp before going to the
overall<00:01:53.100> game<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.690> also<00:01:54.929> features<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
download away with the sweep knob like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.380 
download away with the sweep knob like
this<00:02:06.920> as<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> kill<00:02:08.280> switch<00:02:08.399> which<00:02:08.880> which<00:02:09.239> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this as a kill switch which which is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.890 
this as a kill switch which which is
basically<00:02:09.869> an<00:02:10.049> added<00:02:10.410> gain<00:02:10.799> stage<00:02:11.280> thing<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
basically an added gain stage thing and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.360 
basically an added gain stage thing and
the<00:02:12.989> cool<00:02:13.140> another<00:02:13.530> cool<00:02:13.739> thing<00:02:13.769> with<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370
