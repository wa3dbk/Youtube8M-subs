00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.420
 hello everyone with you circle tv 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.549
 here just recently bought myself as 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.460
 water give birth to practice good I mean 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.320
 German tiger and now that's left in 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.530
 fight I want to show you what kind of car 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.640
 he has absolutely no such condition 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.949
 that stock 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.160
 only gun there are eight eighty 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.010
 centimeters from vodka 3601 thing which 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.809
 I recently sold with great regret 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.109
 all the same circumstances forced me 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.159
 Faster buying new tanks to general 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:44.159
 then you give them and tiger I do not know 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.219
 I rolled up on it just one fight 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.690
 took off the x-37 odd thousands and in principle i 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.429
 I think that rolled back pretty good 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.819
 I hope this fight will work for me too 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.309
 do all this no worse but in general 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:00.339
 so far the guns are already missing this one 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.010
 here that is the goal of some 5 levels yet 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.920
 ok beat but that's higher 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.720
 which level is thicker 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 Well, not really in that fight came from me 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.240
 just pure beating babes I drove 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.730
 I just donâ€™t know about me 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.160
 It turned out such a speed to whom and two 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.170
 shell shell polapat boeukladki 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.380
 I clicked and the cover from me tried to leave 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.330
 but could not general here and there 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.070
 understand there were all sorts of there type 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.040
 big I also managed to circle around 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.770
 pick up a little poke around 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.500
 I picked it and realized that well, in general 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.720
 the gun certainly no longer rolls even though it is 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.160
 principle is quite a still ride 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.600
 DPS may have the form of a note 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.970
 one and a half thousand damage I managed to inflict 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.220
 although it seems to be nothing special 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.930
 thing that can be said for the armor but 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.350
 armor and this tank principle is the same 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.110
 as wikky3000 that first well I do not know there 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.050
 so about the tower, she seems to be like that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.510
 same, too, then another form 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.580
 in general it is enough sometimes for a tank 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.300
 there are some neprobit 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 in general, all the tanks here make their way and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.709
 in the royal theater can already be 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.869
 meet some good enough 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.330
 armor and here it is but not always 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.209
 so let's say sometimes when you really want 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.920
 she doesn't save 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 well what else can I say that me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 here is exactly pleased with this number 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.090
 hit points became already kisses a thousand 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 more you represent a whole thousand this 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.990
 so much can I endure here that is I 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.520
 already got some shots from there 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.069
 some not very big tanks and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.500
 In general, this hip I have not to say that 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.680
 you will be directly strongly melted that is 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.400
 I still have a chance to endure enough 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.340
 many shots 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.300
 let's say from the same isa I can stand 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.600
 shot 3 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.790
 if he is lucky there is more than 600 damage 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.519
 him go that is, it is already as much as three 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.680
 a shot he needs to reload his 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.470
 somewhere around 15 seconds this is not well 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.920
 so too fast I would say so 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.440
 let's put on a harp 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.150
 we will try to kill it to just 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.000
 if it doesn't work out at all 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.540
 sad really want to put something here 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.890
 some days and so too it became tasty 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 well let's come stand fine get well 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 come on, but for that, I just don't like me 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.480
 I do not like for this game just do not like 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.370
 such situations leave me to tank 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.110
 there are literally a few hit points the way 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.700
 my and got but it was agree 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.060
 insulting what remains is a tank 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 there sometimes 10 points there one he happened 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.049
 this also remains one hit tank 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.570
 leaves and after that still travel 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.250
 any hero of the battle she has there 10 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.250
 frags he has there I do not know all sorts 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.530
 medals a lot of all the damage there are thousands of 10 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.540
 was such and drying, I saw it well 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.400
 It costs but a very beast machine is very 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.500
 I want to go there, but I think 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.540
 there is no need to wait for this in the near future 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.760
 name will get her opening shaking now 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 Germans soon I will have 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.910
 bromine bar and hopefully i correct it 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.370
 I called and the bullpen 4 very well, I do not want 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.650
 hope because soon 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.160
 opportunity so let's say their trying them 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.920
 open also 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.750
 a guide will be released soon or by 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.780
 At the time of release of this video will already be 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.220
 century guide 3002 db 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.260
 in general, what can become a typewriter poet 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.550
 she is interesting and fast enough with 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.820
 normal gun 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.900
 but generally quite good 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.250
 best mediocre obskazal after it on 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.590
 my panther will go 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.990
 Someone would already have asked subscribers 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.620
 guide on it, do not try with all your might 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.810
 I open this one in to opened trying 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.030
 go up to the panther will tell you for long 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.490
 I left Vika do top to 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.200
 I will not open the panther that is there 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.870
 you can open it immediately and I will not 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.470
 do anything 3,600 damage meanwhile 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.970
 by the way I will not bother on 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.570
 opening modules better there right away on 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.240
 panther do not know how much time there 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.250
 it will pour out the schedule and schedule your affairs 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.360
 some will not try faster so 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.310
 wait in general what can be said for the tiger 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.900
 tank is now slow I don't know how 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.270
 will be with top engines if their 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.380
 I will certainly put but now he somehow 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.660
 generally goes armor he well but there 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.940
 it is not there that is such an average as this 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.680
 armor if there tuck like there 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.570
 on occasion there may be sometime 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.370
 anything but no longer here and the gun but I 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.980
 I do not know with this instrument is difficult to ride 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.700
 enough now we are just lucky 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.040
 in battle, literally only the seventh 6 and 5 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.280
 come across to us 8 and so on here 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.470
 with them, too, generally problems begin 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.050
 you almost never pierce them 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.050
 and nowhere but they naturally their own 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.640
 the guns are easy to sew but 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.350
 This situation is difficult for us 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.250
 enough opponent in the forehead he is taken from 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.680
 this gun is tight 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.250
 how many we have there from 80 to punch us 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:05.340
 from 87 to 165 they have armor of 120,000 and with 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.560
 any inclined that is necessary above 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.529
 average threshold breaking through somehow successfully 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.929
 shoot some weak spot 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:17.029
 well t-34 is not such a danger 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:19.739
 although sometimes damn so shit these little 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:21.239
 t-34 to any in kind do not expect from them 

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:25.349
 that they are going to punch you like 

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:27.779
 like in the house u so the prize got up like 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.239
 as it crawl took so let's say they 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.729
 cancer thank goodness to god 

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:35.699
 drive and then they start to sew just 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:40.459
 incomprehensible where and incomprehensible how was it 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:43.079
 such a tank is a mystery 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:44.039
 it is not clear yet that is the first impression 

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:46.139
 about the tank is good 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.749
 the only speed and missing and 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.309
 guns though in principle here and with such 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:53.959
 you see you can somehow ride somehow 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:57.299
 survive now 34-ka in my opinion at all 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:07:01.739
 wants to die is not yet lit 

00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:06.779
 enemy t34 he remembers shoots from me 

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:09.619
 scares just really need to now 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:15.089
 try not to get a tass 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:17.219
 yes of course good luck good luck mary krismas not 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:19.259
 we get from her not to punch him why am I 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:22.079
 spoke that is an adversary so complex 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:25.110
 how is he a top gun at all him good 

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:28.379
 it will be difficult to cope with him now 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.229
 then punch him hard and even 34 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:32.419
 it is not clear where the pancake probably beats the most 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.879
 nasty 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:38.929
 than the main problem is this from this on 

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:43.529
 really problems with a capital letter 

00:07:38.929 --> 00:07:45.959
 I hope very well 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.849
 and breaking through and of course not getting with 

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:50.039
 our speed go private on not 

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:54.029
 very much and it will work but you need it 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:56.789
 get yes of course gun us it is not 

00:07:54.029 --> 00:08:00.449
 let us do we'll wait for him 

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:03.689
 and hope for a miracle and not a miracle 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:07.409
 happened and in general I don't know it all 

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:09.689
 very sad but tegar-tan good here 

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:13.499
 so miracle happened somehow 

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:15.479
 and I did not even hope for 5000 damage to the gentlemen 

00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:19.939
 in general, I think you understand this tank 

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:19.939
 all buy, I recommend it to you
