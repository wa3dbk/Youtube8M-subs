 the fact that there is still a bunch of other titles but 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.830
 it does not matter that's all he's wool and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810

 This is the same chess of the 21st century. 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.850

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.170
 five types just go die fine 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.670
 gvp these guys well you made a conclusion that 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.350
 they can not be invited to the beater with 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.209
 such a game I would not have invited them to blood 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.670
 despite being part of navi i 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.560
 But for them I was sick as it put 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.830

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.019

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.170
 Someone will remove that as virtus.pro 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.180

 you can not clean up the wild and you can not 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.030
 no one invites you to do that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.830
 what we tell you we go out on and 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.420
 when we see boys who just 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.100
 go on us a bunch of crazy nuby mills we 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.239
 we go to fight with them and we all die and we 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.300
 we are going to talk to you 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.210

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.850
 you still can 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.010
 forgot i'm saying dima is ok 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.260
 Apple cleans and he is crooked 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.330
 look then he kind of realized that well 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.090
 how would I warn him about it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.940
 I will openly say that if 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.350
 well, there would be two I was a captain and vp or 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.110
 in on youtube some people chose 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.280
 immediately no chance at all 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.390
 We look virtus.pro saying I do not know who they are 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.980
 what are they doing there their manager 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.360
 useless best look useless 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.160
 the manager is there just the manager does not sit 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.600
 doing nothing doing nothing they don't 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.220
 know nothing in dota maybe not know 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.640
 nothing sport forest that sport knows 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.919
 only one thing you enter the hall and 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.669
 swing barbell all that all they know 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.980
 In my opinion 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.900
 the world of eSports where cuts intelligence here 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.480
 this trumpet blows it all they know 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.950
 mint with another slit there is not here at Virtus 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.750
 more or less another manager looked 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.370
 but if you remove these here which of 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.840
 teams follow that is a diver drimer 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.240
 at least they know what is like 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.460
 modifying your skills ram avenger 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.169
 sits he will say something on viva will be sent and 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.800
 everything and the manager is sitting no further 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:29.630
 development 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:31.640
 there is no it and this development will be only 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.169
 in five ten years when we will be 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.090
 I do not know for 100 million bucks to give 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.990
 like real football then 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.960
 real development 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.030
 yes will start showing the top of the frame bucks not 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.340
 will you by no means be 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.890
 my need to develop these five rum and 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.380

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.860
 they need trainers yo all who such 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.110
