00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 hello how about friends this time 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.200
 I bring the game of nba 2 every 15 so 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.840
 I hope you open them from this video and what 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.550
 can support with a line and we can 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.710
 just released and is available so 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.180
 only in the actor measurement so the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 description of the video will leave you in link 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.450
 so they can download it and once 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 leave the game in prehistory 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.030
 update the link so they can 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.520
 download directly from there 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.200
 the fire has a weight of 1.9 gigas 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.060
 approximately and requires a 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.670
 4.2 top version of Android for 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.380
 to be able to operate in terms of hardware what 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 more advisable is to execute yo game in 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.420
 devices that have a memory 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 1gb ram as the game as you can 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.230
 see account with some excellent graphics 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.880
 and therefore needs a good 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.650
 hardware to be able to move from good 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.360
 way maybe I can the functions in 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.910
 devices that have a memory 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.800
 so 512 megabytes but commercially not 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.720
 it is more advisable to execute it in 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.489
 devices with at least 1 gb of ram 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.670
 so that it does not work in a more 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.670
 fluid 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.800
 i 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 yes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.330
 the version until 10 then 1.0 but 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.920
 I remind you that in the link of the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.869
 description of the video you will find 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.490
 he was updated as he gets in 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.430
 the fire once it is available in the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.410
 Facebook 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 the game as you can see has about 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.370
 excellent graphics and because of that is the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 play something every good thing of this 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 game is that we do not need a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370
 Internet connection to play 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.289
 or not 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 As for the gameplay, it's pretty 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.030
 simple and easy to understand from the side 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.440
 left of the screen we will have the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.180
 joystick with which we will move to 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.980
 our players and the right side 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 We will have three different buttons 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160
 action 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
