00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 

you'll<00:01:57.150> see<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.570> mean<00:01:57.600> what<00:01:57.900> how<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.229> makes

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you'll see what I mean what how it makes

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
you'll see what I mean what how it makes
it<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.220> have<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.430> like<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it be here well you have it like this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.570 
it be here well you have it like this
open<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.660> back<00:02:00.810> up<00:02:02.450> take<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.570> scissors<00:02:04.050> and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
open it back up take your scissors and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.210 
open it back up take your scissors and
you<00:02:05.840> estimate<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> third<00:02:07.620> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> paper

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you estimate about a third of the paper

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.140 
you estimate about a third of the paper
so<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:09.390> should<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.220> two

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
so one should be like right here two

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.650 
so one should be like right here two
three<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> third<00:02:14.160> well<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.240> can<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
three on a third well you can do this

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.550 
three on a third well you can do this
down<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:18.110> you're<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.200> take<00:02:19.440> your

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
down here you're gonna take your

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.030 
down here you're gonna take your
scissors<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.040> cut<00:02:20.270> on<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.989> line<00:02:22.320> up<00:02:22.530> the

scissors and cut on that line up the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.350 
scissors and cut on that line up the
first<00:02:23.280> third<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.610> accurate<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.090> cut

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
someone might want to fill it a bit a

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.650 
someone might want to fill it a bit a
couple<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.430> times<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:20.060> try<00:05:21.060> try<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.510> make<00:05:21.630> it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
couple of times so I try try and make it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.680 
couple of times so I try try and make it
stand<00:05:22.560> up<00:05:22.889> if<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.789> can't<00:05:24.030> don't<00:05:24.270> worry<00:05:24.330> about

stand up if you can't don't worry about

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.420 
stand up if you can't don't worry about
it<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.919> those<00:05:27.410> see<00:05:28.410> it<00:05:28.650> cannot<00:05:29.130> fit

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
it and that's those see it cannot fit

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.930 
it and that's those see it cannot fit
there<00:05:29.729> although<00:05:30.120> it's<00:05:30.450> like<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.630> perfect<00:05:31.229> fit

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
there although it's like a perfect fit

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.840 
there although it's like a perfect fit
well<00:05:32.940> this<00:05:33.419> piece<00:05:33.720> is<00:05:34.710> about<00:05:34.889> a<00:05:35.010> perfect<00:05:35.580> fit

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
well this piece is about a perfect fit

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.400 
well this piece is about a perfect fit
and<00:05:36.770> over<00:05:37.770> here<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:39.270> half<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:40.080> about<00:05:40.350> a

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
and over here this half it's about a

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.690 
and over here this half it's about a
perfect<00:05:40.860> fit<00:05:41.130> but<00:05:41.520> it<00:05:42.210> will<00:05:42.389> not<00:05:42.570> fit<00:05:42.930> because

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
perfect fit but it will not fit because

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.290 
perfect fit but it will not fit because
it's<00:05:44.700> an<00:05:44.820> illusion<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:47.460> only<00:05:47.789> way<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.000> do

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
it's an illusion and the only way to do

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.379 
it's an illusion and the only way to do
it<00:05:48.479> is<00:05:48.690> if<00:05:49.080> you<00:05:49.229> were<00:05:49.380> well<00:05:49.830> this<00:05:50.820> is<00:05:50.970> cheating

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
it is if you were well this is cheating

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.940 
it is if you were well this is cheating
