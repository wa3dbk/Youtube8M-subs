00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.219
 for when they detect that the pool is 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.590
 overflowing doors that warn if someone 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.840
 enter or leave the house edges means 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 monitors or electricity if 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.310
 produces a leak is not about a 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.189
 fiction this is a digital home a 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.210
 house the center allows you thanks to 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.210
 new technologies 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.280
 insurance is very important the part of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.390
 security the control part of all 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.400
 the resources that we can have 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.720
 we have to think that we in the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.670
 digital home the only thing we do is 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.590
 interact with the teams and the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.600
 systems of people 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 pending becomes also a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 tool we can help the caregiver to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 that certain tasks can be developed 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200
 just turn it on 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.410
 with your eyes 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.740
 Y 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.780
 us through a device like 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.670
 this one we could control by 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.119
 example a water leak in case you 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.880
 we had an intrusion alert or 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.500
 we could control that a person then 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.180
 have a problem and let's see what 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.800
 government moves or is trying 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.869
 leave home when not when not 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.430
 should we could access cameras from 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.020
 security to see from outside that is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.840
 what's happening is the technology 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 and nobody is going to cost because he is in charge 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 that of paying it all when it gets up 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.250
 put the house to your liking 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.960
 the issue of heating temperature 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.610
 It is also something that we are 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.729
 activities that we consider very 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.810
 obvious very habit of us but for 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.810
 these people are not so 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 can help remember labels 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.250
 smart that can carry the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 objects when they approach it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.050
 indicate tasks that they have to 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.050
 perform and what it serves in its object 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.709
 but of the present 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.750
 it's about incorporating technologies 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.849
 that we all know to be more 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.620
 comfortable in our home something that 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.319
 only can they be allowed 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.480
