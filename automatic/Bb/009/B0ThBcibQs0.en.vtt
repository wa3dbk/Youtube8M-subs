okay well a degree in civil engineering

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
okay well a degree in civil engineering
it's<00:00:35.100> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> give<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> broad<00:00:36.240> range<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it's kind of give you a broad range of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.030 
it's kind of give you a broad range of
all<00:00:37.860> different<00:00:38.430> types<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.700> work<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.450> example

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
all different types of work for example

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
all different types of work for example
siblings<00:00:41.040> Silvan<00:00:41.730> engineering<00:00:42.120> deals<00:00:42.390> with

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
siblings Silvan engineering deals with

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.570 
siblings Silvan engineering deals with
structures<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.070> you'll<00:00:44.220> be<00:00:44.310> getting<00:00:44.490> the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
structures so you'll be getting the

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.910 
structures so you'll be getting the
concrete<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.090> steel<00:00:45.330> it<00:00:46.170> deals<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.560> soul

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
concrete and steel it deals with soul

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.729 
concrete and steel it deals with soul
and<00:00:46.950> rock<00:00:47.250> stability<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:49.290> look<00:00:49.470> down<00:00:49.590> at

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and rock stability so you look down at

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
and rock stability so you look down at
the<00:00:49.770> ground<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.180> may<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the ground you know you may think it's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.440 
the ground you know you may think it's
really<00:00:51.900> boring<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.380> it's<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.800> technical

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
really boring but it's really technical

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.299 
really boring but it's really technical
then<00:00:54.450> you<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.900> water<00:00:55.320> resources<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
then you have water resources so you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
then you have water resources so you
think<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.760> flood<00:00:56.970> control<00:00:57.140> when<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> rains

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
think of flood control when it rains

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
think of flood control when it rains
where<00:00:58.860> does<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.010> water<00:00:59.130> go<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.790> do<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> do

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
where does the water go what do you do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.329 
where does the water go what do you do
with<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.339> environmental

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
with it you have environmental

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.160 
with it you have environmental
engineering<00:01:02.699> which<00:01:02.970> deals<00:01:03.269> with<00:01:03.390> okay<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
engineering which deals with okay you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.720 
engineering which deals with okay you
have<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.440> this<00:01:04.589> waste<00:01:04.920> coming<00:01:05.190> from<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.489> city

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
have all this waste coming from a city

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.400 
have all this waste coming from a city
how<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> treat<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.080> after

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
how do you treat it what do you do after

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.500 
how do you treat it what do you do after
that<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.910> have<00:01:09.060> project

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that and then you have project

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120 
that and then you have project
management<00:01:09.810> where<00:01:10.230> it's<00:01:10.620> more<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
management where it's more on the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
management where it's more on the
construction<00:01:11.610> side<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.060> okay<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.660> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
construction side of okay we have to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.030 
construction side of okay we have to
build<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.170> building<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.620> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> build

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
build this building we have to build

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.399 
build this building we have to build
this<00:01:14.190> project<00:01:14.540> what's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> best<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> do

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this project what's the best way to do

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.450 
this project what's the best way to do
it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.550 
it
the<00:01:17.940> most<00:01:18.120> efficiently<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.200> cheapest

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the most efficiently and the cheapest

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680 
the most efficiently and the cheapest
way<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.460> civil<00:01:20.730> engineering<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.360> broad

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
way so civil engineering is very broad

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.320 
way so civil engineering is very broad
so<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.010> University<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.370> Texas<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so here at the University of Texas they

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.560 
so here at the University of Texas they
give<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.370> brief<00:01:26.370> exposure<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:27.090> each<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
give you brief exposure to each one of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
give you brief exposure to each one of
these<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.620> through<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> major<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
these as you go through the major and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.390 
these as you go through the major and
then<00:01:29.940> kind<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.540> last<00:01:30.780> semester<00:01:31.229> -<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
then kind of your last semester - you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
then kind of your last semester - you
kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.880> choose<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:34.290> which

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
kind of get to choose the which

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.810 
kind of get to choose the which
direction<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.010> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:35.550> far<00:01:35.700> as

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
direction you want to take as far as

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
direction you want to take as far as
your<00:01:35.940> elective<00:01:36.300> classes<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:37.260> those<00:01:37.410> different

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
your elective classes in those different

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.760 
your elective classes in those different
areas<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> described

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.080 

okay<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.950> pursued<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.550> degree<00:01:45.670> in<00:01:45.820> civil

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
okay I pursued a degree in civil

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.000 
okay I pursued a degree in civil
engineering<00:01:46.180> because<00:01:46.870> growing<00:01:47.230> up<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:47.590> always

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
engineering because growing up I always

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.430 
engineering because growing up I always
liked<00:01:48.340> math<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.700> science<00:01:49.300> always<00:01:50.050> did<00:01:50.260> well

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
liked math and science always did well

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.110 
liked math and science always did well
in<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.890> thought<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.160> was<00:01:51.250> interesting<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.090> I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
in it I thought it was interesting so I

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.270 
in it I thought it was interesting so I
was<00:01:52.330> thinking<00:01:52.630> okay<00:01:53.050> I<00:01:53.290> want<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.950> do<00:01:54.040> civil

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
was thinking okay I want to do civil

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280 
was thinking okay I want to do civil
engineering<00:01:54.760> even<00:01:55.600> though<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.780> really<00:01:56.080> didn't

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
engineering even though I really didn't

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.730 
engineering even though I really didn't
quite<00:01:56.500> know<00:01:56.710> what<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.890> was<00:01:57.480> but<00:01:58.480> I<00:01:58.870> suggested

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
quite know what it was but I suggested

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.020 
quite know what it was but I suggested
people<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.160> are<00:02:00.250> very<00:02:00.430> interested<00:02:00.760> in<00:02:00.850> math

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
people that are very interested in math

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.100 
people that are very interested in math
and<00:02:01.180> science<00:02:01.260> especially<00:02:02.260> especially<00:02:03.130> how

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and science especially especially how

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.750 
and science especially especially how
physical<00:02:05.110> principles<00:02:05.590> work<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.160> maybe<00:02:06.520> how<00:02:06.730> a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
physical principles work of maybe how a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.540 
physical principles work of maybe how a
building<00:02:07.120> is<00:02:07.480> able<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.870> stand<00:02:08.170> or<00:02:08.710> maybe<00:02:09.369> if

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
building is able to stand or maybe if

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
building is able to stand or maybe if
you're<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.970> kid<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.300> you're<00:02:10.420> playing

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
you're a little kid and you're playing

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.890 
you're a little kid and you're playing
with<00:02:10.690> Legos<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.470> like<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.980> build<00:02:12.160> things<00:02:12.900> just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
with Legos and like to build things just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.510 
with Legos and like to build things just
if<00:02:14.140> you're<00:02:14.320> interested<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:14.860> physics<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.460> how

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
if you're interested in physics and how

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.449 
if you're interested in physics and how
forces<00:02:15.910> work<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.660> things<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.980> would

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
forces work and things like that I would

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.760 
forces work and things like that I would
definitely<00:02:19.030> say<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.660> civil<00:02:20.200> engineering<00:02:20.530> route

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
definitely say a civil engineering route

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.910 
definitely say a civil engineering route
is<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.640> great<00:02:22.090> way<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> go<00:02:22.630> especially<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.830> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
is a great way to go especially if you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.890 
is a great way to go especially if you
want<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.250> deal<00:02:24.430> with<00:02:24.580> large-scale<00:02:25.030> projects

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
want to deal with large-scale projects

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.800 
want to deal with large-scale projects
civil<00:02:26.800> engineering<00:02:27.040> projects<00:02:27.490> always<00:02:27.810> range

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
civil engineering projects always range

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.230 
civil engineering projects always range
in<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.170> multi-million<00:02:29.800> dollar<00:02:30.100> projects<00:02:30.790> so

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
in the multi-million dollar projects so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.060 
in the multi-million dollar projects so
if<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.600> want<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.870> work<00:02:32.020> large-scale<00:02:32.620> and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
if you want to work large-scale and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.890 
if you want to work large-scale and
really<00:02:33.700> help<00:02:34.000> Society<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
really help Society in the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.410 
really help Society in the
infrastructure<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.830> society<00:02:36.700> that's<00:02:36.970> really

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
infrastructure of society that's really

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
infrastructure of society that's really
a<00:02:37.600> great<00:02:37.959> way<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.140> go<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.709> good<00:02:38.890> if<00:02:39.040> you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
a great way to go so it's good if you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.160 
a great way to go so it's good if you
like<00:02:39.250> math<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:39.490> science<00:02:39.690> also<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.020> want

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
like math and science also if you want

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.260 
like math and science also if you want
to<00:02:41.230> help<00:02:41.320> society<00:02:41.800> become<00:02:42.100> better<00:02:42.880> more

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
to help society become better more

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.449 
to help society become better more
technical<00:02:43.840> more<00:02:43.870> advanced<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:45.010> also<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.340> good

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
technical more advanced it's also a good

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.740 
technical more advanced it's also a good
way<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> go<00:02:45.910> also

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.699 

so<00:02:51.750> once<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.080> get<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> degree<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.530> civil

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
so once you get a degree in civil

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.680 
so once you get a degree in civil
engineering<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.580> several<00:02:54.000> options<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
engineering you have several options the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.869 
engineering you have several options the
option<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.470> took<00:02:55.709> was<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.340> grad<00:02:56.610> school

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
option I took was to go to grad school

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.220 
option I took was to go to grad school
because<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.330> wanted<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.690> learn<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.140> about

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because I wanted to learn more about

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.050 
because I wanted to learn more about
civil<00:02:58.560> engineering<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.879> more

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
civil engineering and be more

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.330 
civil engineering and be more
specialized<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.290> certain<00:03:01.319> area<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:01.980> civil

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
specialized in a certain area of civil

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.860 
specialized in a certain area of civil
engineering<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.269> that's<00:03:03.420> why<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.569> chose<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
engineering so that's why I chose to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.839 
engineering so that's why I chose to
pursue<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.260> master's<00:03:04.470> degree<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:05.250> highly

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
pursue a master's degree I highly

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.780 
pursue a master's degree I highly
recommend<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.799> but<00:03:07.799> obviously<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.610> lot<00:03:08.760> of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
recommend it but obviously a lot of

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.150 
recommend it but obviously a lot of
people<00:03:09.060> go<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.450> work<00:03:09.599> with<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.650> degree<00:03:11.069> in

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
people go out and work with a degree in

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.820 
people go out and work with a degree in
civil<00:03:11.340> engineering<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.989> gives<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> lot<00:03:13.650> of

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
civil engineering it gives you a lot of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.880 
civil engineering it gives you a lot of
options<00:03:14.069> for<00:03:14.549> example<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.690> work<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.230> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
options for example you can work in a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.440 
options for example you can work in a
consulting<00:03:17.459> route<00:03:17.610> with<00:03:17.819> a<00:03:17.849> private<00:03:18.299> company

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
consulting route with a private company

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.490 
consulting route with a private company
you<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.769> work<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.640> government<00:03:20.670> as<00:03:21.629> such

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you can work with the government as such

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.520 
you can work with the government as such
as<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> state<00:03:23.040> or<00:03:23.220> federal<00:03:23.250> agency<00:03:24.239> for<00:03:24.530> example

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
as a state or federal agency for example

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.660 
as a state or federal agency for example
we<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.739> Texas<00:03:26.250> Department<00:03:26.370> of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
we have Texas Department of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.729 
we have Texas Department of
Transportation<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:27.569> my<00:03:28.260> research

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
Transportation here my research

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.370 
Transportation here my research
currently<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.970> joint<00:03:30.329> project<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:31.110> them

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
currently is a joint project with them

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.650 
currently is a joint project with them
so<00:03:32.220> they<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.910> civil<00:03:33.180> engineers<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.630> staff

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
so they have civil engineers on staff

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780 
so they have civil engineers on staff
and<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.860> work<00:03:35.069> with<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> state<00:03:35.549> obviously

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and you work with the state obviously

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.020 
and you work with the state obviously
that<00:03:36.090> has<00:03:36.180> benefits<00:03:36.629> of<00:03:36.750> its<00:03:36.870> own<00:03:37.910> on<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
that has benefits of its own on the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.789 
that has benefits of its own on the
other<00:03:39.180> hand<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.599> can<00:03:39.750> also<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.170> military

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
other hand you can also go the military

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.490 
other hand you can also go the military
route<00:03:41.120> military<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.299> always<00:03:42.720> building<00:03:43.170> things

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
route military is always building things

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.069 
route military is always building things
and<00:03:44.010> remote<00:03:44.910> places<00:03:45.209> they<00:03:45.569> always<00:03:45.930> need

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
and remote places they always need

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.009 
and remote places they always need
engineers<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:47.190> construct<00:03:47.340> bases<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.540> do<00:03:48.840> this

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
engineers to construct bases and do this

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.050 
engineers to construct bases and do this
in<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.379> so<00:03:50.250> with<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.549> degree<00:03:50.819> in<00:03:50.879> civil

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
in that so with a degree in civil

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.479 
in that so with a degree in civil
engineering<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.200> several<00:03:52.650> options<00:03:52.890> and

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
engineering you have several options and

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.160 
engineering you have several options and
all<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.750> them<00:03:54.900> are<00:03:55.019> really<00:03:55.139> good

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.980 

so<00:03:59.770> the<00:04:00.370> typical<00:04:00.610> course<00:04:01.120> load<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.720> course

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
so the typical course load and course

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.470 
so the typical course load and course
progression<00:04:02.590> as<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:02.890> go<00:04:03.090> through<00:04:04.090> getting

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
progression as you go through getting

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.660 
progression as you go through getting
your<00:04:04.690> siblings<00:04:05.050> and<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.260> degree<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.740> one<00:04:06.459> your

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
your siblings and in degree is one your

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.980 
your siblings and in degree is one your
first<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.090> second<00:04:07.360> year<00:04:07.569> are<00:04:07.720> going<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.930> be

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
first and second year are going to be

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.800 
first and second year are going to be
covering<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.530> basics<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:09.400> example<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.660> have

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
covering the basics for example you have

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.660 
covering the basics for example you have
your<00:04:10.959> physics<00:04:11.410> one<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.040> two<00:04:12.160> you<00:04:12.400> have<00:04:12.520> your

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
your physics one and two you have your

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.630 
your physics one and two you have your
chem<00:04:12.970> 1<00:04:13.209> &amp;<00:04:13.390> 2<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.780> have<00:04:13.870> your<00:04:14.020> calculus<00:04:14.560> 1<00:04:15.280> 2<00:04:15.459> &amp;

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
chem 1 &amp; 2 you have your calculus 1 2 &amp;

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.550 
chem 1 &amp; 2 you have your calculus 1 2 &amp;
3<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.540> that's<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.900> lay<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.200> groundwork

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
3 so that's going to lay the groundwork

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.640 
3 so that's going to lay the groundwork
for<00:04:17.739> everything<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.669> do<00:04:19.120> after<00:04:19.329> that

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
for everything that you do after that

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.409 
for everything that you do after that
okay<00:04:20.650> moving<00:04:21.100> on<00:04:21.220> from<00:04:21.370> there<00:04:21.609> you<00:04:22.060> kind<00:04:22.360> of

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
okay moving on from there you kind of

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.409 
okay moving on from there you kind of
get<00:04:22.570> into<00:04:22.780> your<00:04:23.650> statics<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.580> dynamics<00:04:24.669> where

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
get into your statics and dynamics where

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.540 
get into your statics and dynamics where
you<00:04:25.540> get<00:04:25.690> into<00:04:25.870> forces<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.830> how<00:04:27.400> they

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
you get into forces and how they

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.550 
you get into forces and how they
interact<00:04:28.000> with<00:04:28.090> one<00:04:28.210> another<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:29.110> doing

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
interact with one another and doing

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.720 
interact with one another and doing
force<00:04:30.250> Freebody<00:04:30.910> diagrams<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.010> then<00:04:33.400> once

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
force Freebody diagrams and then once

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.000 
force Freebody diagrams and then once
you<00:04:33.850> get<00:04:33.970> past<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.500> then<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.620> start<00:04:35.860> getting

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
you get past that then you start getting

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.520 
you get past that then you start getting
into<00:04:36.280> your<00:04:36.790> intro<00:04:37.270> level<00:04:37.510> courses<00:04:37.930> -<00:04:38.260> civil

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
into your intro level courses - civil

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.320 
into your intro level courses - civil
engineering<00:04:38.919> so<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.700> have<00:04:39.820> intro<00:04:40.180> and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
engineering so you have intro and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.820 
engineering so you have intro and
environmental<00:04:40.870> engineering<00:04:41.260> intro<00:04:41.770> to

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
environmental engineering intro to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.640 
environmental engineering intro to
structural<00:04:42.760> engineering<00:04:43.390> so<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.530> so

okay<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.919> want<00:05:09.190> to<00:05:09.340> take<00:05:09.970> a<00:05:10.000> more<00:05:10.270> advanced

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
okay I want to take a more advanced

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.540 
okay I want to take a more advanced
class<00:05:10.930> in<00:05:11.320> environmental<00:05:11.890> engineering<00:05:12.280> or

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
class in environmental engineering or

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.060 
class in environmental engineering or
geotechnical<00:05:13.120> engineering<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.440> that's<00:05:14.860> kind

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
geotechnical engineering so that's kind

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.780 
geotechnical engineering so that's kind
of<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.250> progression<00:05:15.430> of<00:05:15.760> how<00:05:15.910> it<00:05:16.030> goes

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.030 

so<00:05:20.790> as<00:05:21.000> far<00:05:21.180> as<00:05:21.240> classes<00:05:21.780> that<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.740> could<00:05:22.890> take

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
so as far as classes that you could take

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.650 
so as far as classes that you could take
as<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.220> high<00:05:23.400> school<00:05:23.640> student<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:24.120> benefit<00:05:24.540> you

as a high school student to benefit you

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.500 
as a high school student to benefit you
in<00:05:24.690> college<00:05:25.170> for<00:05:25.710> sure<00:05:26.040> take<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.850> AP<00:05:27.180> courses

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
in college for sure take the AP courses

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.100 
in college for sure take the AP courses
especially<00:05:28.350> AP<00:05:28.980> Physics<00:05:29.460> AP<00:05:30.300> calculus<00:05:30.870> AP

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
chemistry because you're going to be

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.540 
chemistry because you're going to be
seeing<00:05:33.840> all<00:05:34.110> those<00:05:34.500> things<00:05:34.770> again<00:05:35.100> your<00:05:35.310> first

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and second years of college so it's not

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.940 
and second years of college so it's not
necessarily<00:05:39.120> civil<00:05:39.930> engineering<00:05:40.290> but<00:05:40.650> those

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
necessarily civil engineering but those

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.300 
necessarily civil engineering but those
basic<00:05:41.940> principles<00:05:42.170> carry<00:05:43.170> over<00:05:43.620> as<00:05:43.950> far<00:05:44.130> as

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
basic principles carry over as far as

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.640 
basic principles carry over as far as
how<00:05:44.910> physics<00:05:45.390> work<00:05:45.630> interaction<00:05:46.530> between

going<00:06:48.120> into<00:06:48.270> civil<00:06:48.600> engineering<00:06:49.220> but<00:06:50.220> I<00:06:50.490> found

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
going into civil engineering but I found

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.900 
going into civil engineering but I found
out<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.480> in<00:06:51.840> my<00:06:52.169> college<00:06:52.680> life<00:06:53.310> so<00:06:53.610> far<00:06:53.790> I've

out that in my college life so far I've
been<00:06:53.940> on<00:06:54.180> the<00:06:54.270> campus<00:06:54.600> six<00:06:54.840> years<00:06:55.139> that<00:06:55.980> I

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
been on the campus six years that I

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.550 
been on the campus six years that I
thought<00:06:57.480> I've<00:06:57.630> really<00:06:57.870> matured<00:06:57.990> as<00:06:58.440> a<00:06:58.470> person

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560
