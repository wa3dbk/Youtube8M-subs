tend to drop things so that's one

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
tend to drop things so that's one
concern<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.539> that<00:01:12.929> if<00:01:13.079> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> this

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
concern that I have that if this is this

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.489 
concern that I have that if this is this
thin<00:01:14.219> and<00:01:14.399> might<00:01:14.579> break<00:01:14.990> they<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.139> to<00:01:16.289> buy<00:01:16.469> a

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
going to go here you are once the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.470 
going to go here you are once the
bluetooth<00:02:31.070> keyboard<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:31.910> connected<00:02:32.390> and

everything<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.110> ipad<00:02:33.500> one<00:02:34.250> nice<00:02:34.430> thing<00:02:34.460> is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
everything to the ipad one nice thing is

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.090 
everything to the ipad one nice thing is
the<00:02:35.270> battery<00:02:35.660> life<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.530> batteries

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
the battery life on the batteries

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.370 
the battery life on the batteries
themselves<00:02:37.250> are<00:02:37.970> really<00:02:38.420> long<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.960> one<00:02:39.140> main

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
themselves are really long the one main

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.970 
themselves are really long the one main
reason<00:02:39.410> for<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:40.070> is<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.970> it's<00:02:41.150> closed<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
reason for that is when it's closed it

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.710 
reason for that is when it's closed it

back<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:46.520> turns<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.030> auto<00:02:47.690> connects

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
back up it turns on and auto connects

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.680 
back up it turns on and auto connects

right away as you can see like I said
with<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.170> use<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:52.510> magnet<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.720> stays<00:02:54.620> up

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
with the use of this magnet it stays up

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.070 
with the use of this magnet it stays up
very<00:02:55.010> well<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.670> actually<00:02:55.850> put<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.930> to

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
very well you can actually put it to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.250 
very well you can actually put it to
almost<00:02:57.500> any<00:02:57.800> angle<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.640> want<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:59.360> don't<00:03:00.200> know

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
almost any angle you want I don't know

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.290 
almost any angle you want I don't know
why<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.440> would<00:03:00.590> want<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:01.030> all<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.090> way<00:03:02.150> back

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
why you would want it all the way back

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.260 
why you would want it all the way back
here<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.780> could<00:03:02.990> if<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.380> want<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.270> one

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
can move this whole bottom part to the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.260 
can move this whole bottom part to the
back<00:03:33.230> but<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.010> keyboard<00:03:34.490> itself<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
back but then the keyboard itself the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
back but then the keyboard itself the
farthest<00:03:35.720> it's<00:03:36.110> going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> go<00:03:36.710> is<00:03:37.010> right<00:03:37.430> there

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
farthest it's going to go is right there

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.890 
farthest it's going to go is right there
so<00:03:39.290> if<00:03:39.680> i'm<00:03:39.920> not<00:03:40.160> using<00:03:40.430> keyboard<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.300> i<00:03:41.660> just

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so if i'm not using keyboard and i just

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.820 
so if i'm not using keyboard and i just
want<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.260> know<00:03:43.510> will<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.690> something<00:03:44.960> the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
want to know will do something the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.080 
want to know will do something the
keyboard<00:03:46.160> obviously<00:03:46.550> this<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.790> not<00:03:46.820> her

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
keyboard obviously this is not her

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.210 
keyboard obviously this is not her
canonically<00:03:47.800> whatsoever<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.830> good<00:03:49.130> idea<00:03:49.400> so<00:03:51.220> so

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
canonically whatsoever a good idea so so

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.790 
canonically whatsoever a good idea so so
yeah<00:03:52.400> for<00:03:52.670> me<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.240> would<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:53.660> be<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.170> best

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
yeah for me this would not be the best

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.150 
yeah for me this would not be the best
solution<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:57.200> like<00:03:57.530> having<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.980> go<00:03:58.130> all

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
solution I I do like having to go all

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.090 
solution I I do like having to go all
the<00:03:58.370> way<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.000> back<00:03:59.210> but<00:03:59.960> if<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.560> are<00:04:00.590> pay

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
the way to the back but if you are pay

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.270 
the way to the back but if you are pay
with<00:04:01.400> not<00:04:01.640> doing<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.920> some<00:04:03.920> other<00:04:03.950> nice

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
with not doing that then some other nice

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280 
with not doing that then some other nice
things<00:04:04.520> about<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:05.030> is<00:04:05.240> that<00:04:05.480> well<00:04:05.930> first<00:04:06.200> of

and another key that i noticed that i
tend<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.169> hit<00:06:07.410> a<00:06:07.440> lot<00:06:07.650> when<00:06:07.860> I<00:06:07.890> was<00:06:07.979> using<00:06:08.220> this

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
tend to hit a lot when I was using this

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.430 
tend to hit a lot when I was using this
the<00:06:09.090> left<00:06:09.419> shift<00:06:09.870> key<00:06:09.990> is<00:06:11.030> nice<00:06:12.030> and<00:06:12.240> big<00:06:12.539> the

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
the left shift key is nice and big the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.159 
the left shift key is nice and big the
right<00:06:13.770> shift<00:06:14.160> key<00:06:14.250> it's<00:06:15.180> only<00:06:15.390> half<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.750> size

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
right shift key it's only half the size

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.830 
right shift key it's only half the size
because<00:06:16.590> part<00:06:16.890> of<00:06:16.950> it<00:06:17.100> is<00:06:17.280> with<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.060> up<00:06:18.240> arrow

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
because part of it is with the up arrow

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.159 
because part of it is with the up arrow
so<00:06:19.680> if<00:06:19.979> I<00:06:20.280> wanted<00:06:20.669> a<00:06:20.760> shift<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.510> I'm<00:06:21.600> using<00:06:21.810> the

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
so if I wanted a shift and I'm using the

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.719 
so if I wanted a shift and I'm using the
right<00:06:22.470> shift<00:06:22.800> key<00:06:22.860> sometimes<00:06:23.430> I<00:06:23.520> would<00:06:23.640> hit

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
right shift key sometimes I would hit

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.090 
right shift key sometimes I would hit
the<00:06:23.880> up<00:06:24.060> arrow<00:06:24.090> so<00:06:25.020> those<00:06:25.229> are<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:25.440> two<00:06:25.500> keys

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
the up arrow so those are the two keys

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.200 
the up arrow so those are the two keys
