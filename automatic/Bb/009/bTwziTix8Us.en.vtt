because<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.990> took<00:00:10.230> back<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.710> my<00:00:10.950> friends<00:00:11.610> from

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
because I took back to my friends from

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
because I took back to my friends from
their<00:00:12.330> camp<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.840> had<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.320> year<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
their camp and I had this year one now I

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.420 
their camp and I had this year one now I
decided<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.120> back<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.599> him

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.269 

so<00:00:19.180> we<00:00:19.420> had<00:00:19.599> very<00:00:19.630> good<00:00:20.080> results<00:00:20.710> but<00:00:20.859> also<00:00:21.070> I

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
so we had very good results but also I

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.760 
so we had very good results but also I
think<00:00:21.820> it's<00:00:22.029> due<00:00:22.509> to<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.900> quality<00:00:23.230> of<00:00:23.560> the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
think it's due to the quality of the

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.470 
think it's due to the quality of the
things<00:00:24.279> we<00:00:24.520> are<00:00:24.550> proposing<00:00:25.270> and<00:00:25.450> the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
things we are proposing and the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.470 
things we are proposing and the
philosophy

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
philosophy

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.820 
philosophy
I<00:00:28.010> introduce<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.490> very<00:00:30.090> special<00:00:30.180> watch<00:00:30.900> concept

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
I introduce a very special watch concept

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.710 
I introduce a very special watch concept
watch<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.820> absolutely<00:00:33.480> crazy

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
watch with which is absolutely crazy

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.060 
watch with which is absolutely crazy
because<00:00:34.050> basically<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:35.970> charity<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
because basically it was for charity and

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.479 
because basically it was for charity and
charity<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.820> children<00:00:39.480> seek<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> looking

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
charity for children seek and looking

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.619 
charity for children seek and looking
for<00:00:41.760> some<00:00:42.090> let's<00:00:42.720> say<00:00:42.960> solution<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.010> find<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
for some let's say solution to find a

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.470 
for some let's say solution to find a
solution<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.350> disease<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.400> in<00:00:48.059> fact<00:00:48.330> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
solution for this disease and in fact I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
solution for this disease and in fact I
thought<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> mother<00:00:49.800> taking<00:00:50.309> charge

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
thought about a mother taking charge

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.340 
thought about a mother taking charge
only<00:00:51.330> in<00:00:51.840> her<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.519> decide<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.180> try<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
only in her and I decide to try to to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
only in her and I decide to try to to
put<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> watch

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
put that on the watch

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.780 
put that on the watch
so<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.540> by<00:00:57.750> pushing<00:00:58.110> you<00:00:58.860> know<00:00:59.040> on<00:00:59.580> both

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
so just by pushing you know on both

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.259 
so just by pushing you know on both
sides<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.140> open<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.710> arm<00:01:02.550> if<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.030> may<00:01:03.210> see

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
sides you can open your arm if I may see

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.560 
sides you can open your arm if I may see
and<00:01:03.659> closing<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.620> but<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.519> only<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and closing it but it's not only as the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
and closing it but it's not only as the
only<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> owe

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
only thing if you want you can just owe

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.469 
only thing if you want you can just owe
our<00:01:09.180> flip<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.860> turning<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.120> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
our flip it and by turning like that to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.750 
our flip it and by turning like that to
bring<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.250> mess

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
bring it back it's a mess

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.620 
bring it back it's a mess
but<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.140> yeah<00:01:16.740> still<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> tells

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
but it is time to yeah still it tells

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.230 
but it is time to yeah still it tells
time<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> conic<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.970> fact

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
time but it's a conic off and in fact

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.340 
time but it's a conic off and in fact
the<00:01:21.869> main<00:01:22.140> fact<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:23.070> how<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:24.350> these

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the main fact was how to put these

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 
the main fact was how to put these
windows<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.190> front<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.760> both<00:01:27.030> sides<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.720> again

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
windows in front on both sides so again

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.109 
windows in front on both sides so again
you<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> Owls<00:01:28.920> independent<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you have the Owls independent and the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
you have the Owls independent and the
minutes<00:01:30.540> independent<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> say

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
minutes independent when I say

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
minutes independent when I say
independent<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:32.909> because<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.479> working

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
independent it's because I'm working

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.529 
independent it's because I'm working
with<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.409> was<00:01:34.649> Segundo<00:01:35.159> Gio's<00:01:35.430> he<00:01:35.909> surpassed

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
with that was Segundo Gio's he surpassed

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.319 
with that was Segundo Gio's he surpassed
on<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> other<00:01:37.020> side<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:38.039> same<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
on the other side and same here so it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
on the other side and same here so it
means<00:01:39.840> each<00:01:40.229> time<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.859> a<00:01:41.009> construction

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
means each time it's a construction

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.609 
means each time it's a construction
never<00:01:41.969> seen<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.390> derby<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.899> piece<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.500> the

cast and I always keep cease to be on
but<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.859> want<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.340> make<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:09.270> different<00:02:09.990> style<00:02:10.289> of

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
but I want to make a different style of

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.590 
but I want to make a different style of
Tomio<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.460> the<00:02:11.610> only<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.090> will<00:02:12.300> say<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
Tomio so the only thing I will say is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.620 
Tomio so the only thing I will say is
you<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.680> see<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.190> teeth<00:02:14.520> shining<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.390> some

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
you can see some teeth shining and some

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
you can see some teeth shining and some
matte<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.770> my<00:02:17.430> vision<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:18.030> to

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
matte one here and my vision was to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.380 
matte one here and my vision was to
create<00:02:18.300> something<00:02:18.980> exclusive<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.640> they'll

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
create something exclusive so they'll

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.930 
create something exclusive so they'll
work<00:02:21.660> with<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.110> exclusive<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.460> almost<00:02:23.760> like

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
work with the exclusive it's almost like

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.390 
work with the exclusive it's almost like
a<00:02:23.970> skeleton<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.290> skeleton<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
a skeleton it's a skeleton but it's a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.750 
a skeleton it's a skeleton but it's a
skeleton<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.180> 3d<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:28.530> never<00:02:28.950> exists<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
skeleton in 3d what never exists on the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.820 
skeleton in 3d what never exists on the
watch<00:02:29.970> did<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.690> how<00:02:30.870> deep<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.319> get

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
watch did you see how deep is it get

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.000 
watch did you see how deep is it get
gorgeous<00:02:32.340> means<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
gorgeous means I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.640 
gorgeous means I
I<00:02:34.040> made<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> skeleton<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.690> each<00:02:35.900> piece<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
I made the skeleton of each piece and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.920 
I made the skeleton of each piece and
afterward<00:02:37.129> I've<00:02:37.280> rebuilt<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.910> movement<00:02:38.120> what's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
afterward I've rebuilt a movement what's

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.600 
afterward I've rebuilt a movement what's
the<00:02:39.080> price<00:02:39.290> point<00:02:39.319> within<00:02:39.920> without<00:02:40.069> idols

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
the price point within without idols

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.360 
the price point within without idols
were<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:41.150> fact<00:02:41.480> without<00:02:41.720> diamond<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:43.010> think

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
were in fact without diamond I think

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.960 
were in fact without diamond I think
it's<00:02:43.610> 230<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:45.080> one<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> nail<00:02:46.160> titanium

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
it's 230 this one is a nail titanium

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.119 
it's 230 this one is a nail titanium
knee<00:02:47.239> or<00:02:47.360> titanium<00:02:47.660> means<00:02:48.080> it's<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.500> titanium

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
knee or titanium means it's a titanium

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.150 
knee or titanium means it's a titanium
that<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:49.879> treat<00:02:50.180> changing<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.050> molecule<00:02:51.530> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
that we treat changing the molecule to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.160 
that we treat changing the molecule to
have<00:02:52.310> something<00:02:52.790> harder<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.480> changing<00:02:54.019> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
have something harder and changing the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.949 
have something harder and changing the
color<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.099> want<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:55.760> color<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.480> be<00:02:56.630> rude

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
color so I want this color to be rude

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.350 
color so I want this color to be rude
like<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.920> was<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.190> room<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.760> fear<00:02:58.970> something

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
like if it was a room I fear something

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.530 
like if it was a room I fear something
very<00:02:59.750> natural<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.470> inside<00:03:01.370> I'm<00:03:01.670> putting<00:03:02.390> a

dyes that we produce ourselves and it's
hand<00:03:05.450> dyed<00:03:06.230> when<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.739> say<00:03:07.069> hunter<00:03:07.480> means<00:03:08.480> would

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
hand dyed when I say hunter means would

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.199 
hand dyed when I say hunter means would
use<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.980> by<00:03:10.130> hand<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.700> what's<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.030> price

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
use it by hand and what's the price

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.670 
use it by hand and what's the price
point<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.630> this<00:03:11.720> workshop<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.500> one<00:03:12.829> is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
point of this workshop this one is

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.670 
point of this workshop this one is
25,000<00:03:15.680> more<00:03:15.890> there's<00:03:16.329> 25,000<00:03:17.349> Swiss<00:03:18.349> franc

25,000 more there's 25,000 Swiss franc

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.860 
25,000 more there's 25,000 Swiss franc
excellent<00:03:19.519> another<00:03:20.090> piece<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.810> piece

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
excellent another piece and this piece

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.589 
excellent another piece and this piece
is<00:03:21.220> very<00:03:22.220> simple<00:03:22.940> again<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:25.030> conic<00:03:26.030> it's<00:03:26.450> a

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
is very simple again it's a conic it's a

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.069 
is very simple again it's a conic it's a
normal<00:03:26.930> watch<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.250> see<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.489> cases<00:03:29.269> with

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
normal watch but you see the cases with

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.069 
normal watch but you see the cases with
less<00:03:30.410> column<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.430> stronger<00:03:32.090> one<00:03:32.269> even<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:32.959> it

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
less column and stronger one even so it

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.539 
less column and stronger one even so it
gives<00:03:33.349> more<00:03:34.329> energy<00:03:35.329> if<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.930> may<00:03:36.079> say<00:03:36.319> it's<00:03:36.980> deep

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
gives more energy if I may say it's deep

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.150 
gives more energy if I may say it's deep
oh<00:03:38.000> well<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> way<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:38.900> treat<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.829> very

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
oh well the way we treat it is very

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.910 
oh well the way we treat it is very
funny<00:03:40.579> because<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:41.569> fact<00:03:41.840> on<00:03:42.079> one<00:03:42.290> side<00:03:42.590> half

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
funny because in fact on one side half

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.009 
funny because in fact on one side half
of<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.250> watch<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.910> completely<00:03:44.569> dark<00:03:44.780> you

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
of the watch it's completely dark you

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.340 
of the watch it's completely dark you
can<00:03:45.230> see<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.620> movement<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.760> once<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:48.049> also

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
can see the movement and once time also

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.699 
can see the movement and once time also
so<00:03:48.620> secondly<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.489> passing<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.209> part<00:03:51.109> at

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
so secondly is passing on this part at

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.830 
so secondly is passing on this part at
this<00:03:51.920> time<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.370> will<00:03:52.609> slow<00:03:52.970> down<00:03:53.000> because<00:03:53.510> you

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this time it will slow down because you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.520 
this time it will slow down because you
have<00:03:54.049> no<00:03:54.609> no<00:03:55.609> nothing<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.600> see<00:03:57.079> what's<00:03:57.380> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
have no no nothing to see what's the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.890 
have no no nothing to see what's the
time<00:03:57.769> so<00:03:58.069> when<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:58.579> have<00:03:58.730> nothing<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.420> see<00:03:59.780> you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
time so when you have nothing to see you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.569 
time so when you have nothing to see you
know<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.170> seems<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.769> be<00:04:00.889> very<00:04:01.100> long<00:04:01.280> and

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
know it seems to be very long and

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.599 
know it seems to be very long and
certainly<00:04:02.329> from<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:03.109> o'clock<00:04:03.440> till<00:04:04.190> seven

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
certainly from one o'clock till seven

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.270 
certainly from one o'clock till seven
o'clock<00:04:04.850> you<00:04:05.660> have<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:06.139> one<00:04:06.410> working<00:04:07.069> and

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
o'clock you have this one working and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.210 
o'clock you have this one working and
you<00:04:07.760> think<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> will<00:04:08.359> slip<00:04:08.780> down<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:09.739> this

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
you think it will slip down like if this
