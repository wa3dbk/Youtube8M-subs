 5s I'm going to leave the factory with the s7 people 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.860
 recommends that you back up 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 details of the new system for safety and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.270
 You can do this in two ways. 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.879
 icloud or itunes after 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.280
 install s7 in good 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.859
 microsoft released the prices of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.140
 windows 8.1 for those who do not have windows 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 8 is because who already has 128 can 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.200
 update for free has a version 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 costing $ 119 and the proof version goes 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.330
 cost 199 dollars 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 who has windows 7 can upgrade 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.259
 wherever you want but Microsoft does not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 recommends that anyone with a windows 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.049
 view or xp face and bad that the machine 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.119
 may not support windows 8.1 that will be 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.990
 officially launched on the 18th of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.939
 October 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.360
 a highlight of the new iphones is the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.229
 processor 7 having architecture 64 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.030
 bits 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.759
 but look what legal curiosity 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.100
 raised by the site ars technica knew 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.240
 you android have this support already 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.520
 quite a long time 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.280
 this is because it is based on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.530
 linux what happens is that it does not have 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.439
 no smartphone or tablet with a 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 hardware that supports 64 architecture 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.740
 bits 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.720
 but depending on samsung this can be 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.149
 sports change soon she promised that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.060
 the next device of the company will have 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.310
 support for 64 bit architecture 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.979
 let's wait for bacteria and cells 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.920
 may be the future of industry and 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.360
 existing factories in general 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 projects that work with 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.709
 manipulation of bacteria and cells to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
 manufacture products 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.970
 example, this sheet of cells and the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.430
 benefit of the handling of 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.140
 micro-organisms is less dependent on the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.380
 This oil is always good. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.650

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.900
