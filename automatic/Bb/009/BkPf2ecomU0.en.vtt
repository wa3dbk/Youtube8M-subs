00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
the first tweet me looking at is a tweak

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.540 
the first tweet me looking at is a tweak
or<00:00:46.969> choose<00:00:47.270> my<00:00:47.480> function<00:00:47.989> now<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.010> is<00:00:49.160> an

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
or choose my function now this is an

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.369 
or choose my function now this is an
interesting<00:00:49.670> little<00:00:50.149> app<00:00:50.360> actually<00:00:50.570> which<00:00:51.350> is

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
interesting little app actually which is

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.720 
interesting little app actually which is
kind<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:51.920> different<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.280> anything<00:00:52.430> I've<00:00:52.610> seen

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
kind of different to anything I've seen

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.000 
kind of different to anything I've seen
before<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:53.930> is<00:00:54.050> obviously<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.649> two-year

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
before so this is obviously a two-year

do safe mode so those who I think could

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.480 
do safe mode so those who I think could
really<00:01:24.110> come<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.289> quite<00:01:24.560> handy<00:01:24.590> actually<00:01:25.220> just

obviously you've got to be a little bit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.139 
obviously you've got to be a little bit
careful<00:01:30.349> if<00:01:30.590> you've<00:01:30.740> got<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.369> safe<00:01:31.940> mode

song skip and just your sort of function

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.590 
song skip and just your sort of function
how<00:03:57.930> you'd<00:03:58.110> expect<00:03:58.530> shuffle<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.239> repeat<00:04:00.239> and

things like that so it is kind of good

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.670 
things like that so it is kind of good
in<00:04:03.570> my<00:04:03.690> opinion<00:04:03.720> because<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.290> doesn't<00:04:04.530> take<00:04:04.650> up

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
in my opinion because it doesn't take up

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.860 
in my opinion because it doesn't take up
much<00:04:04.830> space<00:04:04.980> you'll<00:04:05.520> see<00:04:05.820> I<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.570> quite<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.810> few

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
much space you'll see I have quite a few

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.479 
much space you'll see I have quite a few
things<00:04:07.170> on<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.320> notification<00:04:07.920> center<00:04:08.250> anyway

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
things on my notification center anyway

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.280 
things on my notification center anyway
so<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.880> need<00:04:09.030> any<00:04:09.450> space<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.930> actually<00:04:10.020> see

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
so you need any space to actually see

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.140 
so you need any space to actually see
notifications<00:04:10.560> at<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.130> end<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.400> day<00:04:11.520> so

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
notifications at the end of the day so

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.790 
notifications at the end of the day so
that's<00:04:12.810> quite<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.080> good<00:04:13.230> little<00:04:13.350> sweet<00:04:13.590> because

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
that's quite a good little sweet because

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.470 
that's quite a good little sweet because
it<00:04:13.920> doesn't<00:04:14.130> take<00:04:14.250> up<00:04:14.370> much<00:04:14.430> room<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
it doesn't take up much room so the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.360 
it doesn't take up much room so the
ideal<00:04:15.840> to<00:04:15.989> use<00:04:16.020> with<00:04:16.260> dashboard<00:04:16.709> X<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.220> can

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
at here is called invisible grab a 5.1

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.499 
at here is called invisible grab a 5.1
so<00:04:40.770> if<00:04:41.099> you're<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.400> five<00:04:41.669> point<00:04:41.909> one<00:04:41.970> point<00:04:42.090> one

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
so if you're on five point one point one

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.510 
so if you're on five point one point one
and<00:04:42.539> you've<00:04:42.810> got<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.050> camera<00:04:43.919> grab<00:04:44.159> a<00:04:44.190> thing

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
and you've got the camera grab a thing

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.330 
and you've got the camera grab a thing
for<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:44.849> lock<00:04:45.599> screen<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:46.560> basically<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.220> a

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
for the lock screen this basically is a

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.890 
for the lock screen this basically is a
winterboard<00:04:47.759> theme<00:04:48.000> which<00:04:48.180> you'll<00:04:48.419> hide<00:04:48.690> that

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
winterboard theme which you'll hide that

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.510 
winterboard theme which you'll hide that
for<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.289> so<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:49.919> see<00:04:50.099> here<00:04:50.370> I've

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
for you so you can see here I've

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.180 
for you so you can see here I've
actually<00:04:50.900> got<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.080> little<00:04:52.319> icon<00:04:52.710> hidden<00:04:53.039> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
actually got the little icon hidden and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.790 
actually got the little icon hidden and
it<00:04:54.090> still<00:04:54.300> works<00:04:54.599> actually<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.650> still

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
it still works actually so you can still

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.770 
it still works actually so you can still
go<00:04:56.099> ahead<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.430> slide<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.639> up<00:04:56.849> and<00:04:57.000> open<00:04:57.690> the

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
go ahead and slide it up and open the

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.330 
go ahead and slide it up and open the
camera<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.229> stuff<00:04:58.409> but<00:04:58.650> obviously<00:04:59.009> you<00:04:59.129> don't

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
camera and stuff but obviously you don't

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.399 
camera and stuff but obviously you don't
have<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.520> little<00:04:59.759> icon<00:05:00.120> there<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.960> would<00:05:01.319> be

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
have a little icon there and would be

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.439 
have a little icon there and would be
nice<00:05:01.620> actually<00:05:02.099> if<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.430> kind<00:05:02.699> of<00:05:02.879> extended

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
nice actually if this kind of extended

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.119 
nice actually if this kind of extended
all<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.659> way<00:05:03.720> across<00:05:03.840> because<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.919> kind<00:05:05.039> of

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:05.129 
all the way across because that kind of

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:07.399 
all the way across because that kind of
looks<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.370> bit<00:05:05.460> weird<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:06.000> be<00:05:06.270> honest<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.690> I

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
looks a bit weird to be honest and I

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.200 
looks a bit weird to be honest and I
think<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.860> kind<00:05:08.159> of<00:05:08.280> benefits<00:05:08.849> you<00:05:08.940> just<00:05:09.090> have

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
think it kind of benefits you just have

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.219 
think it kind of benefits you just have
the<00:05:09.300> iphone<00:05:09.599> there<00:05:09.750> anyway<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.139> it's

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
the iphone there anyway because it's

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.770 
the iphone there anyway because it's
kind<00:05:10.590> of<00:05:10.650> why<00:05:11.280> it's<00:05:11.460> over<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.849> one<00:05:12.000> side<00:05:12.030> but

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
kind of why it's over to one side but

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.029 
kind of why it's over to one side but
then<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:12.930> guess<00:05:12.990> luck<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.800> still<00:05:14.009> use

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
then I guess luck so you can still use

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.430 
then I guess luck so you can still use
the<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:15.030> camera<00:05:15.419> grabber<00:05:15.659> there<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.199> still

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
the the camera grabber there so still

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.680 
the the camera grabber there so still
opens<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.949> camera<00:05:17.219> and<00:05:17.340> things<00:05:17.520> so<00:05:18.150> that's

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
opens the camera and things so that's

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.209 
opens the camera and things so that's
that<00:05:18.870> cool<00:05:19.169> little<00:05:19.349> tweak<00:05:19.620> so<00:05:19.979> that's

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
that cool little tweak so that's

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.529 
that cool little tweak so that's
actually<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.550> winterboard<00:05:21.060> theme<00:05:21.270> i<00:05:21.300> should

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
this works so they said this has three

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.269 
this works so they said this has three
main<00:06:00.360> features<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.990> first<00:06:01.020> feature<00:06:01.319> is<00:06:02.009> going

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
main features the first feature is going

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.980 
main features the first feature is going
to<00:06:02.340> be<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.490> three<00:06:02.909> finger<00:06:03.150> tap<00:06:03.509> on<00:06:03.719> the<00:06:03.750> screen

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
to be a three finger tap on the screen

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.170 
to be a three finger tap on the screen
actually<00:06:04.409> gives<00:06:05.219> you<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.490> full<00:06:05.699> screen<00:06:05.969> mode

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
actually gives you the full screen mode

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.269 
actually gives you the full screen mode
so<00:06:06.690> in<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.050> sense<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.590> better<00:06:07.800> than<00:06:07.919> safari

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
so in a sense is better than safari

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.430 
so in a sense is better than safari
anyway<00:06:08.669> because<00:06:08.849> you<00:06:09.120> don't<00:06:09.300> have<00:06:09.389> this<00:06:09.629> bar<00:06:10.409> a

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
anyway because you don't have this bar a

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.959 
anyway because you don't have this bar a
bottom<00:06:10.919> kind<00:06:11.129> of<00:06:11.219> covering<00:06:11.520> up<00:06:11.550> some<00:06:11.789> of<00:06:11.909> the

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
bottom kind of covering up some of the

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.420 
bottom kind of covering up some of the
screen<00:06:12.240> and<00:06:12.270> i<00:06:12.509> think<00:06:12.719> reading<00:06:12.979> kind<00:06:13.979> of<00:06:14.069> text

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
screen and i think reading kind of text

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.909 
screen and i think reading kind of text
on<00:06:14.520> safari<00:06:15.000> for<00:06:15.300> iphone<00:06:15.719> or<00:06:15.960> ipod<00:06:16.500> touch<00:06:16.710> or

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
on safari for iphone or ipod touch or

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.790 
on safari for iphone or ipod touch or
the<00:06:17.099> smallest<00:06:17.490> screen<00:06:18.479> devices<00:06:18.810> it's<00:06:19.409> kind<00:06:19.650> of

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
the smallest screen devices it's kind of

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.439 
the smallest screen devices it's kind of
difficult<00:06:19.979> so<00:06:20.430> this<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.789> going<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.029> be<00:06:21.120> great

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
difficult so this is going to be great

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:22.730 
difficult so this is going to be great
and<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:21.690> fact<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:21.960> can<00:06:22.139> do<00:06:22.229> it<00:06:22.289> on<00:06:22.349> the<00:06:22.469> fly<00:06:22.590> is

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
and the fact you can do it on the fly is

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.219 
and the fact you can do it on the fly is
going<00:06:23.009> to<00:06:23.069> be<00:06:23.129> so<00:06:23.340> good<00:06:23.520> you<00:06:24.029> know<00:06:24.210> when<00:06:25.110> you

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
going to be so good you know when you

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:26.990 
going to be so good you know when you
reach<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.860> page<00:06:26.039> where<00:06:26.219> you<00:06:26.370> can't<00:06:26.610> really<00:06:26.849> read

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
reach a page where you can't really read

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.969 
reach a page where you can't really read
the<00:06:27.090> text<00:06:27.509> and<00:06:27.810> you<00:06:27.990> want<00:06:28.169> to<00:06:28.229> kind<00:06:28.379> of<00:06:28.469> do<00:06:28.650> bit

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
the text and you want to kind of do bit

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.950 
the text and you want to kind of do bit
of<00:06:29.069> reading<00:06:29.250> you<00:06:29.460> can<00:06:29.550> just<00:06:29.729> do<00:06:29.819> it<00:06:29.849> but<00:06:30.479> anyway

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
of reading you can just do it but anyway

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.869 
of reading you can just do it but anyway

kind of a funny angle because the camera
but<00:06:34.680> um<00:06:34.889> when<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:35.699> do<00:06:35.819> this<00:06:35.940> up<00:06:36.150> just<00:06:36.180> in<00:06:36.509> your

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
but um when you do this up just in your

but um when you do this up just in your
hand<00:06:36.810> you'll<00:06:36.990> get<00:06:37.139> it<00:06:37.229> every<00:06:37.409> time<00:06:37.590> but<00:06:37.710> i

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
hand you'll get it every time but i

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.290 
hand you'll get it every time but i

might actually get this every time so i
just<00:06:39.779> try<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.110> do<00:06:40.319> this<00:06:40.349> and<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:41.129> problem<00:06:41.460> you

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
just try and do this and the problem you

Chrome<00:06:54.360> for<00:06:54.540> iOS<00:06:54.600> browser<00:06:55.290> it's<00:06:55.650> definitely<00:06:56.040> a

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
Chrome for iOS browser it's definitely a

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.980 
Chrome for iOS browser it's definitely a
lot<00:06:56.220> better<00:06:56.400> than<00:06:56.610> safari<00:06:56.880> in<00:06:57.060> my<00:06:57.180> opinion<00:06:57.420> so

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
lot better than safari in my opinion so

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.440 
lot better than safari in my opinion so
you<00:06:58.080> see<00:06:58.230> here<00:06:58.410> text<00:06:58.800> is<00:06:58.890> just<00:06:59.070> a<00:06:59.160> breeze<00:06:59.460> and

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
you see here text is just a breeze and

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.690 
you see here text is just a breeze and
then<00:07:00.600> you<00:07:00.720> can<00:07:01.160> like<00:07:02.160> if<00:07:02.370> you<00:07:02.460> want<00:07:02.610> to

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
then you can like if you want to

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.000 
then you can like if you want to
obviously<00:07:02.790> bring<00:07:03.120> the<00:07:03.260> top<00:07:04.260> bar<00:07:04.290> back<00:07:04.620> up<00:07:04.830> you

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
obviously bring the top bar back up you

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.710 
obviously bring the top bar back up you
can<00:07:05.160> just<00:07:05.280> go<00:07:05.430> ahead<00:07:05.490> and<00:07:05.610> tap<00:07:05.820> that<00:07:06.000> your<00:07:06.540> top

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
can just go ahead and tap that your top

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.630 
can just go ahead and tap that your top
bar<00:07:06.900> comes<00:07:07.170> up<00:07:07.410> so<00:07:07.920> that's<00:07:08.100> the<00:07:08.220> first<00:07:08.520> thing

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
bar comes up so that's the first thing

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.520 
bar comes up so that's the first thing
and<00:07:08.910> then<00:07:09.000> the<00:07:09.090> second<00:07:09.420> thing<00:07:09.450> which<00:07:10.110> just

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
and then the second thing which just

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.560 
and then the second thing which just
makes<00:07:10.740> it<00:07:10.890> a<00:07:10.950> lot<00:07:11.190> more<00:07:11.250> intuitive<00:07:11.880> is<00:07:12.090> a<00:07:12.270> pull

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
makes it a lot more intuitive is a pull

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.720 
makes it a lot more intuitive is a pull
to<00:07:12.720> refresh<00:07:12.840> the<00:07:13.680> other<00:07:13.860> animation<00:07:14.490> that<00:07:14.640> you

can use so anywhere any page you can
oddities<00:07:18.090> pull<00:07:18.390> to<00:07:18.510> refresh<00:07:18.600> which<00:07:19.130> makes<00:07:20.130> it

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
oddities pull to refresh which makes it

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.860 
oddities pull to refresh which makes it
feel<00:07:20.460> in<00:07:20.790> line<00:07:20.940> a<00:07:20.970> lot<00:07:21.210> more<00:07:21.390> with<00:07:21.600> all<00:07:21.750> the

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
feel in line a lot more with all the

other iOS apps that are available and
then<00:07:25.500> last<00:07:25.860> but<00:07:25.950> not<00:07:26.100> least<00:07:26.160> if<00:07:26.490> you<00:07:27.060> do<00:07:27.450> a

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
then last but not least if you do a

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.260 
then last but not least if you do a
two-finger<00:07:28.140> swipe<00:07:28.290> from<00:07:29.100> left<00:07:29.160> to<00:07:29.400> right<00:07:29.490> then

two-finger swipe from left to right then

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.450 
two-finger swipe from left to right then
you<00:07:30.510> can<00:07:30.750> go<00:07:31.110> back<00:07:31.470> to<00:07:31.500> the<00:07:31.710> last<00:07:31.890> page<00:07:32.160> so
