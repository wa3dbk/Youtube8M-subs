00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
where's the motor will you just took it

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.710 
where's the motor will you just took it
in<00:00:32.320> actually<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.710> other<00:00:32.860> day<00:00:33.010> um<00:00:33.790> all<00:00:34.449> the

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
the guys gonna try to just hone it out

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.270 
the guys gonna try to just hone it out
but<00:00:43.330> it<00:00:43.750> might<00:00:44.500> need<00:00:44.650> a<00:00:44.710> little<00:00:44.860> bit<00:00:45.040> more<00:00:45.220> work

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
back in yes yeah yeah so since the block

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.170 
back in yes yeah yeah so since the block

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
was in we moved on to the transmission

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.030 
was in we moved on to the transmission
we<00:01:04.449> took<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.720> out<00:01:04.839> got<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.170> all<00:01:05.290> cleaned<00:01:05.560> up<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
we took it out got it all cleaned up and

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.000 
we took it out got it all cleaned up and
we<00:01:06.130> gave<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.610> really<00:01:06.850> nice<00:01:07.060> coat<00:01:07.420> of<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
we gave it a really nice coat of this

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.000 
we gave it a really nice coat of this
cast<00:01:09.640> iron<00:01:09.880> gray<00:01:10.330> all<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.409> these<00:01:11.560> I<00:01:11.590> thought

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
cast iron gray all of these I thought

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
cast iron gray all of these I thought
everything<00:01:12.220> was<00:01:12.430> gonna<00:01:12.610> be<00:01:12.729> bright<00:01:13.060> silver

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
everything was gonna be bright silver

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
everything was gonna be bright silver
yes<00:01:14.860> except<00:01:15.070> for<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.280> why<00:01:17.429> but<00:01:18.429> that<00:01:18.579> was<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
yes except for this why but that was the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.160 
yes except for this why but that was the
whole<00:01:19.000> point<00:01:19.210> was<00:01:19.359> everything<00:01:19.780> was<00:01:19.929> going<00:01:20.109> to

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
whole point was everything was going to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.169 
whole point was everything was going to
be<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.380> same<00:01:20.560> color<00:01:20.890> yeah<00:01:21.460> but<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.759> silver<00:01:22.060> we

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
be the same color yeah but the silver we

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.760 
be the same color yeah but the silver we
got<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.509> was<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.659> little<00:01:22.869> bit<00:01:23.020> too<00:01:23.259> bright<00:01:23.560> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
got it was a little bit too bright and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.859 
got it was a little bit too bright and
it<00:01:24.640> didn't<00:01:24.880> really<00:01:25.030> look<00:01:25.149> too<00:01:25.390> good<00:01:25.539> on<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
it didn't really look too good on the

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.810 
it didn't really look too good on the
transmission<00:01:26.439> so<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.799> guys<00:01:27.100> try<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.460> paint<00:01:27.670> it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
transmission so you guys try to paint it

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.399 
transmission so you guys try to paint it
the<00:01:27.850> other<00:01:28.030> silver<00:01:28.420> color<00:01:28.630> yeah<00:01:28.899> we<00:01:29.049> painted

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
the other silver color yeah we painted

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.410 
the other silver color yeah we painted
it<00:01:29.499> the<00:01:29.560> other<00:01:29.770> color<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.369> then<00:01:30.520> let<00:01:31.179> me<00:01:31.270> see

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
it the other color and then let me see

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.690 
it the other color and then let me see
this<00:01:31.570> day<00:01:31.749> shift<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:32.409> really<00:01:32.530> cool<00:01:32.700> yeah

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
this day shift this is really cool yeah

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.370 
this day shift this is really cool yeah
let<00:01:34.030> me<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.299> like<00:01:34.719> these<00:01:34.929> are<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.170> sensors

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
let me just like these are the sensors

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.469 
let me just like these are the sensors
they<00:01:36.039> were<00:01:36.100> really<00:01:36.460> really<00:01:36.759> rough<00:01:36.969> we<00:01:37.270> clean

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
they were really really rough we clean

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.020 
they were really really rough we clean
them<00:01:37.600> all<00:01:37.780> up<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:40.170> set<00:01:41.170> sensors<00:01:41.619> for<00:01:41.829> what<00:01:42.069> you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
them all up and set sensors for what you

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.880 
them all up and set sensors for what you
know<00:01:43.119> I'm<00:01:43.359> not<00:01:43.630> honestly<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.530> hundred<00:01:44.829> percent

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
know I'm not honestly a hundred percent

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.999 
know I'm not honestly a hundred percent
sure<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.579> think<00:01:45.789> it's<00:01:45.939> for<00:01:46.319> like<00:01:47.319> temperature

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
sure I think it's for like temperature

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.399 
sure I think it's for like temperature
probably<00:01:48.819> fluids<00:01:49.240> or<00:01:49.390> something<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.289> that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
probably fluids or something is that

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.109 
probably fluids or something is that
duct<00:01:50.740> tape<00:01:50.979> I<00:01:51.130> see<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:51.490> there<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.819> is<00:01:52.090> not

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
duct tape I see on there that is not

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.620 
duct tape I see on there that is not
ducks<00:01:52.420> eat<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.689> is<00:01:52.840> electrical<00:01:53.200> tape<00:01:54.630> don't

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
ducks eat that is electrical tape don't

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.539 
ducks eat that is electrical tape don't
worry<00:01:55.840> about<00:01:56.049> it<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.439> is<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.979> supposed<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.460> be

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
worry about it it is it supposed to be

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.029 
worry about it it is it supposed to be
electrical<00:01:58.179> tape<00:01:58.389> or<00:01:58.659> Jenna<00:01:59.109> didn't<00:01:59.590> see<00:01:59.889> it's

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
electrical tape or Jenna didn't see it's

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.010 
electrical tape or Jenna didn't see it's
just<00:02:00.249> it's<00:02:00.490> all<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:00.939> electrical<00:02:01.420> wires<00:02:01.659> I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
gear lever out that it was missing two

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.350 
gear lever out that it was missing two
really<00:02:25.430> important<00:02:27.340> little<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.520> guess<00:02:28.580> washers

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
really important little I guess washers

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.730 
really important little I guess washers
are<00:02:30.430> little<00:02:31.430> rubber<00:02:31.820> things<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.500> felt

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
are little rubber things and so it felt

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.290 
are little rubber things and so it felt
like<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> seven-speed<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:35.000> couldn't

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
like it was a seven-speed you couldn't

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.940 
like it was a seven-speed you couldn't
really<00:02:35.450> find<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.870> gear<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.320> now<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.620> real

bushings in mm-hmm um when fat girls
piece<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.820> lookbook<00:03:20.510> oh<00:03:20.720> yeah<00:03:21.140> we're<00:03:21.320> just

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
piece of lookbook oh yeah we're just

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.050 
piece of lookbook oh yeah we're just
slowly<00:03:21.830> trying<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.250> get<00:03:22.370> all<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.550> brake<00:03:22.790> lines

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
slowly trying to get all the brake lines

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.610 
slowly trying to get all the brake lines
and<00:03:23.330> all<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.690> kind<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.960> crap<00:03:24.020> out<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.410> there

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
and all that kind of crap out of there

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.810 
and all that kind of crap out of there
so<00:03:24.830> we<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:26.170> eventually<00:03:27.170> get<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.770> entire<00:03:28.400> car

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
so we can eventually get the entire car

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.190 
so we can eventually get the entire car
off<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.300> frame<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.780> send<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.050> in<00:03:30.170> for

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
off of the frame and send it in for

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.770 
off of the frame and send it in for
paint<00:03:30.590> job<00:03:30.800> but<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.550> is<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:32.060> brake

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
paint job but this is just the brake

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.360 
paint job but this is just the brake
booster<00:03:33.350> okay<00:03:33.709> what<00:03:33.920> are<00:03:33.950> they<00:03:34.100> with<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
booster okay what are they with the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.890 
booster okay what are they with the
difference<00:03:34.640> between<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.120> silver<00:03:35.750> and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
difference between that silver and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.979 
difference between that silver and
that's<00:03:36.080> for<00:03:36.830> shiny<00:03:37.100> silver<00:03:37.580> um<00:03:38.000> well<00:03:38.870> this

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
that's for shiny silver um well this

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.300 
that's for shiny silver um well this
comes<00:03:39.170> off<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.590> front<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.070> block

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
comes off of the front of the block

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.250 
comes off of the front of the block
actually<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.300> it's<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> process<00:03:42.080> of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
actually and so it's in the process of

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.440 
actually and so it's in the process of
turning<00:03:42.530> into<00:03:42.980> becoming<00:03:43.370> like<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.000> silver

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
turning into becoming like this silver

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.050 
turning into becoming like this silver
ok<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.830> painted<00:03:46.190> or<00:03:46.280> just<00:03:46.459> polish<00:03:46.820> this

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
looked like that mm-hmm and we sanded it

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.460 
looked like that mm-hmm and we sanded it
to<00:03:52.370> look<00:03:52.489> like<00:03:52.550> that<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.300> then<00:03:53.750> polish<00:03:54.170> it<00:03:54.350> to
