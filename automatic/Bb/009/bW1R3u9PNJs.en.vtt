he<00:01:57.960> had<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.619> happen<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> first

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
he had that doesn't happen in the first

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.860 
he had that doesn't happen in the first
so<00:02:00.480> he<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.170> insecure<00:02:01.820> collected

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
so he was very insecure collected

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.920 
so he was very insecure collected
definitely<00:02:03.870> I<00:02:04.700> always<00:02:05.700> look<00:02:05.970> at<00:02:06.090> things<00:02:06.420> metal

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
definitely I always look at things metal

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.170 
definitely I always look at things metal
things<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.770> still<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.820> clear<00:02:09.030> out

time she ever saw it this metal I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.190 
time she ever saw it this metal I
understood<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.550> about<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.239> size<00:03:36.570> of

that but every time she would say

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.310 
that but every time she would say
anything<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.640> she<00:03:53.880> emphasized<00:03:54.420> but<00:03:55.170> it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
anything like that she emphasized but it
