00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 mortals as they are speaking 307 a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.269
 new video from minecraft pocket edition 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 good guys this time I will bring you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.880
 as is probably minecraft in the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.590
 version 0.20 fine boys so that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 see the success that these videos have had 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 we get to version 0.20 and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 we started to feel lost videos 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 previous looks at the active favors and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.700
 we started good in this new version 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.469
 there is going to be a very powerful 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.170
 the robot machine gun 7 an ally of what 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.329
 which is the brand jose 0 or 7 good lie 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.789
 but a robot submachine gun in which 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.190
 we can kill also at a distance or 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 weapons that will give us in the game as 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 we can observe here in the next 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.789
 image we are going to have weapons and we can 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 also practice with the scarecrow 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.430
 although as you can see in the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.859
 image to defeat the robot 7 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 that have machine guns also not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 only with a sword but 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 we recommend weapons in this version 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.310
 0.20 of abuse that of said this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.670
 version we're going to have what they are 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 Special mannequins even for mini 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.610
 zombies that we make and spend animals and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.000
 all made to measure and size of box that go 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.759
 exist for this version 0.20 so 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.689
 enjoy it here so we can see and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.640
 accommodate our scarecrow of 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 from training to not destroy 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 our giant box 07 we can 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 dress as we want we can 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.470
 say it with gold armor with 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.010
 diamonds and it's going to be very very but very 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.040
 resistant to test our shots 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.540
 version 0.20 also to see blocks 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.850
 traps that are going to fire a burst of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 but according to what the block is for 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.900
 example a burst of diamonds a 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.450
 diamond block obviously that will kill 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.260
 the player if he does not itch with the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 correct peak here in this new version 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.790
 0.20 what do you think the good idea up 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680
 here I will leave in this first season of 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
 what is how will they dance 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 future mortals if they like the video 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.210
 you know there may be a lot more in the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.260
 future and yes they like to like 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.480
 share and have spoken to them 07/12/10 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.730

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
 author and based also species some 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 of some new or good ones that have not 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.760
 existed not even in 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.670
 computers so here we are 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.260
 innovating dale like for a greater because 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.880

 minecraft because devillo in the future and 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.800
 if you would like to leave me the recommendation 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.819
 of some game or video game that I had to 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.069
 you want me to do 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.319
 a container as I think they could be 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.189
 those games based on the trajectory 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.599
 of the same 2007 table and thanks for 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.639

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.139
 they saw if I do not recommend them look at it 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.629

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.269
