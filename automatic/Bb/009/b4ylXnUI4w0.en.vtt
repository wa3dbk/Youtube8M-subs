faint<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.869> tried<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.350> something

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
faint where they tried to do something

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
faint where they tried to do something
about<00:01:49.740> crop<00:01:50.040> subsidies<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> trim<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.210> just

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
about crop subsidies and trim them just

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.240 
about crop subsidies and trim them just
a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.899> around<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> margin<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:52.710> boom

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
a little bit around the margin then boom

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.700 
a little bit around the margin then boom
they<00:01:53.490> were<00:01:53.549> stopped<00:01:53.939> by<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.689> house<00:01:55.380> AG

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
they were stopped by the house AG

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.880 
they were stopped by the house AG
committee<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.259> he's<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.740> up

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
committee and so I think he's really up

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
committee and so I think he's really up
against<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.240> what's<00:02:00.390> happening<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
against it I think what's happening is

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
against it I think what's happening is
it<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.799> deliberate<00:02:02.219> strategy<00:02:02.520> where

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it is a pretty deliberate strategy where

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
it is a pretty deliberate strategy where
where<00:02:04.880> Michelle<00:02:05.880> Obama<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.780> raising<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
where Michelle Obama is is raising the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.040 
where Michelle Obama is is raising the
consciousness<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> issue<00:02:08.280> because

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
consciousness of the issue because

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.600 
consciousness of the issue because
important<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> recognize<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
important thing to recognize is for a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.790 
important thing to recognize is for a
great<00:02:11.910> many<00:02:12.209> Americans<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.230> food<00:02:13.470> system

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
great many Americans this food system

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
great many Americans this food system
works<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.160> fine<00:02:14.400> there's<00:02:15.030> plenty<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.480> cheap

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
works just fine there's plenty of cheap

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.210 
works just fine there's plenty of cheap
food<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.680> highly<00:02:17.310> edible<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:19.010> it's<00:02:20.010> not

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
food and it's highly edible and it's not

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.420 
food and it's highly edible and it's not
a<00:02:20.250> problem<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:22.349> not<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> crisis<00:02:23.069> doesn't<00:02:23.340> feel

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
a problem it's not a crisis doesn't feel

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
a problem it's not a crisis doesn't feel
like<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.550> crisis<00:02:24.030> too<00:02:24.239> many<00:02:24.720> people<00:02:25.080> even

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
like a crisis too many people even

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.229 
like a crisis too many people even
though<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.190> food<00:02:26.370> system<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.819> producing

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
though the food system is producing

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.339 
though the food system is producing
diseases<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.900> we're<00:02:28.050> having<00:02:28.260> trouble

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
diseases that we're having trouble

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.809 
diseases that we're having trouble
dealing<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.160> food<00:02:29.340> system<00:02:29.520> is

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
dealing with in the food system is

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.640 
dealing with in the food system is
bleeding<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.269> climate<00:02:30.629> change<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.019> all<00:02:31.470> of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
bleeding the climate change and all of

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.119 
bleeding the climate change and all of
all<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.099> problems<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:34.470> involved

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
all the problems we we know are involved

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.900 
all the problems we we know are involved
so<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:37.280> she's<00:02:38.280> creating<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
so I think that she's creating the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.140 
so I think that she's creating the
constituency<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:39.989> future<00:02:40.650> reform<00:02:41.129> at<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
constituency for future reform at a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
constituency for future reform at a
legislative<00:02:42.810> level<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.319> think<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.650> she's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
legislative level and I think what she's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.170 
legislative level and I think what she's
doing<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.099> significant<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:44.910> very

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
doing is very significant and very

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
doing is very significant and very
deliberate<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.950> think<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.280> that's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
deliberate and I think that that's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.440 
deliberate and I think that that's
exciting<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:49.530> I'm<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.099> I'm<00:02:50.450> moderately

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
exciting so I'm you know I'm moderately

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.559 
exciting so I'm you know I'm moderately
hopeful<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:53.730> what<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.879> really<00:02:54.300> drive

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
hopeful I think what a really drive

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.850 
hopeful I think what a really drive
change<00:02:55.849> what<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:56.970> will<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.349> oddly<00:02:58.349> enough<00:02:58.379> is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
change what it will take oddly enough is

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.790 
change what it will take oddly enough is
if<00:02:59.099> we<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.640> health<00:02:59.879> care<00:03:00.090> reform<00:03:00.800> because

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
if we do get health care reform because

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.770 
if we do get health care reform because
then<00:03:02.129> you'll<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> situation<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:03.480> mean

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
then you'll have a situation I mean

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
then you'll have a situation I mean
whatever<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.769> plan<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.550> will<00:03:05.670> probably<00:03:05.909> be

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
whatever the plan is it will probably be

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.000 
whatever the plan is it will probably be
a<00:03:06.209> plan<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.720> which<00:03:06.750> health<00:03:07.379> care<00:03:07.590> companies

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
a plan in which health care companies

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.949 
a plan in which health care companies
can<00:03:08.159> no<00:03:08.190> longer<00:03:08.519> pick<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:08.940> choose<00:03:09.180> their

prevention which they don't have now

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.750 
prevention which they don't have now
right<00:03:23.840> now<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.049> economics<00:03:24.709> are<00:03:24.889> if<00:03:25.519> you're<00:03:25.730> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
right now the economics are if you're a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.890 
right now the economics are if you're a
health<00:03:25.999> insurer<00:03:26.389> you're<00:03:26.599> better<00:03:26.810> off

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
health insurer you're better off

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.229 
health insurer you're better off
treating<00:03:27.769> diabetes<00:03:28.280> performing<00:03:29.150> an

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239

amputation say than preventing it a case

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.429 
amputation say than preventing it a case
of<00:03:31.519> type<00:03:31.819> 2<00:03:31.969> diabetes<00:03:32.299> which<00:03:32.689> is<00:03:32.840> horrible<00:03:33.409> but

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
of type 2 diabetes which is horrible but

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.209 
of type 2 diabetes which is horrible but
that's<00:03:33.709> that's<00:03:34.129> economic<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:35.569> if<00:03:35.930> they<00:03:36.349> if<00:03:36.980> you

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
that's that's economic so if they if you

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.520 
that's that's economic so if they if you
change<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.700> system<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.329> give<00:03:38.540> them<00:03:38.569> and

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
change the system and you give them and
