things<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.130> were<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> game<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:44.820> he<00:02:44.910> said

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
things that were in a game but he said

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.570 
things that were in a game but he said
this<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> different<00:02:45.810> universe<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:47.190> of

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
this is a different universe because of

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820 
this is a different universe because of
the<00:02:47.700> generations<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.450> consoles<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:48.960> ps2<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the generations of consoles like ps2 and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.660 
the generations of consoles like ps2 and
at<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.000> time<00:02:51.210> 360<00:02:52.170> or<00:02:52.260> ps3<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:53.100> alternate

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
at the time 360 or ps3 is alternate

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.790 
at the time 360 or ps3 is alternate
universes<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.360> literally<00:02:54.810> what<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
universes that's literally what the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.340 
universes that's literally what the
story<00:02:56.130> said<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.700> they<00:02:56.790> said<00:02:57.000> CJ<00:02:57.270> does<00:02:58.110> not

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
story said so they said CJ does not

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.800 
story said so they said CJ does not
exist<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.490> universe<00:02:59.600> meanwhile<00:03:00.600> they

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
exist in this universe meanwhile they

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.800 
exist in this universe meanwhile they
had<00:03:01.050> notes<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.250> game<00:03:02.460> about<00:03:03.000> CJ's<00:03:03.480> mom's

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
had notes in the game about CJ's mom's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.350 
had notes in the game about CJ's mom's
death<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:04.740> contradicts<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.580> what<00:03:06.240> they

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
death so that contradicts to what they

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.180 
death so that contradicts to what they
said<00:03:06.540> originally<00:03:07.020> but<00:03:07.530> that's<00:03:07.830> what<00:03:07.980> people

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
said originally but that's what people

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.840 
said originally but that's what people
want<00:03:08.220> Lamar<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.150> CJ<00:03:09.600> if<00:03:10.250> rockstar<00:03:11.250> would<00:03:11.580> give
