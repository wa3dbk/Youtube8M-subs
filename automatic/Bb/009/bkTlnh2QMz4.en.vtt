this time Hilton I want to talk to you
about<00:00:03.270> our<00:00:03.659> true<00:00:04.140> color<00:00:04.470> imagery<00:00:07.189> we<00:00:08.189> don't

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
about our true color imagery we don't

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.680 
about our true color imagery we don't
necessarily<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:11.370> true<00:00:11.940> color<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.509> every

off-color turbid fresh river water is
coming<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> Delta<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.620> had

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
coming out of the Delta and had

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.630 
coming out of the Delta and had
intermingles<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.350> mixes<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.770> forms

these<00:01:03.390> color<00:01:04.229> changes<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> forth

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
these color changes and and so forth

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.140 
these color changes and and so forth
this<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> taken<00:01:11.460> by<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> same

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this is this is taken by the same

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.320 
this is this is taken by the same
satellite<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.110> sheets<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.710> chlorophyll

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
satellite that sheets your chlorophyll

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.800 
satellite that sheets your chlorophyll
imageries<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.759> great<00:01:20.970> learning<00:01:21.570> tool

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
imageries and it's a great learning tool

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.490 
imageries and it's a great learning tool
to<00:01:22.350> kind<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.189> compare<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.570> between<00:01:25.259> your

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to kind of compare this between your

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.480 
to kind of compare this between your
chlorophyll<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:27.290> learn<00:01:28.310> what<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
chlorophyll to learn what the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.690 
chlorophyll to learn what the
chlorophyll<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> showing<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.670> relative<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
chlorophyll is showing you relative to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
chlorophyll is showing you relative to
actual<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.360> watercolors<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:38.329> it's<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
actual and watercolors and it's it's a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.340 
actual and watercolors and it's it's a
great<00:01:40.500> tool<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.850> compare<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.869> types<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
great tool to compare the two types of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
great tool to compare the two types of
imageries<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.220> they're<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:45.060> shot

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
imageries because they're actually shot

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.350 
imageries because they're actually shot
from<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> same<00:01:47.090> satellite<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:49.729> my<00:01:50.729> belief<00:01:51.090> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
from the same satellite and my belief is

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.730 
from the same satellite and my belief is
that<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.369> human<00:01:53.369> eye<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.909> limited<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.110> terms

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
that the human eye is limited in terms

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.149 
that the human eye is limited in terms
of<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:57.170> glean<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.770> type<00:01:59.130> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
of what we can glean from this type of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.060 
of what we can glean from this type of
data<00:02:01.009> won't<00:02:02.009> look<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.399> further<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.180> into

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
data won't look a little further up into

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.770 
data won't look a little further up into
towards<00:02:05.070> Biloxi<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
towards Biloxi and there's the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.160 
towards Biloxi and there's the
chandeliers<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
chandeliers and you can see how the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.630 
chandeliers and you can see how the
colors<00:02:12.170> tell<00:02:13.170> which<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.860> areas<00:02:14.459> are

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
colors tell which which areas are

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.680 
colors tell which which areas are
fishable<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:15.599> ones<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:17.690> I've

placed the nav tool brought on this

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.070 
placed the nav tool brought on this
color<00:02:21.390> change<00:02:21.810> line<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.360> we've<00:02:24.540> trained<00:02:24.840> this

on that position i'm going to compare

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.759 
on that position i'm going to compare
what<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.709> showing<00:02:34.739> relative<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.880> your

going to go to the single day shot on

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.150 
going to go to the single day shot on
the<00:02:47.640> twenty-eighth<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.650> back<00:02:52.890> in

the twenty-eighth and this is in back in

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.309 
the twenty-eighth and this is in back in
and<00:02:53.819> you'll<00:02:54.000> see<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:57.660> filter<00:02:58.019> change

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
and you'll see that the filter change

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.570 
and you'll see that the filter change
line<00:02:58.680> is<00:03:00.470> consistent<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:02.370> we're
