can go cut some cut some or find some
sticks<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.759> things<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
sticks from things like this is the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.889 
sticks from things like this is the
crepe<00:02:01.110> myrtle<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.490> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> look<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.149> sticks

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
crepe myrtle you want to look for sticks

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.620 
crepe myrtle you want to look for sticks
that<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.229> more<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> surface<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> these

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that have more of a surface to it these

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
that have more of a surface to it these
are<00:02:06.840> okay<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.200> they're<00:02:07.530> smooth<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
are okay but they're smooth and the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
are okay but they're smooth and the
vines<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:09.179> something<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.989> bind<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
vines really want something to bind to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.910 
vines really want something to bind to
so<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> texture<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:13.020> sticks<00:02:13.349> gives<00:02:13.800> it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
so the texture on the sticks gives it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
so the texture on the sticks gives it
something<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.310> grab<00:02:14.489> on<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> easier<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.420> if

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
something to grab on to easier and if

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.660 
something to grab on to easier and if
you<00:02:15.870> leave<00:02:16.050> little<00:02:16.349> nubs<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.190> cleaning

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you leave little nubs as you're cleaning

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
you leave little nubs as you're cleaning
off<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.209> stick<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.379> give<00:02:19.530> something

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
off the stick that will give something

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.650 
off the stick that will give something
else<00:02:20.010> for<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> vine<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.550> attach<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.270> as<00:02:21.510> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
else for the vine to attach to as it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.500 
else for the vine to attach to as it
grows<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.440> these<00:02:23.040> crepe<00:02:23.700> myrtles<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.239> really

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
grows and these crepe myrtles are really

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.780 
grows and these crepe myrtles are really
nice<00:02:24.720> because<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.010> branches<00:02:26.489> are<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
nice because the the branches are so

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.110 
nice because the the branches are so
tall<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.390> linear<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.840> makes<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.080> really<00:02:28.200> good

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
tall and linear it makes a really good

tall and linear it makes a really good
material<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.239> work<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:31.110> need<00:02:31.140> to

now<00:05:48.639> what<00:05:48.820> we're<00:05:48.970> doing<00:05:49.000> here<00:05:49.599> is<00:05:49.720> using<00:05:50.020> a

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
now what we're doing here is using a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.170 
now what we're doing here is using a
stick<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.770> Dibble<00:05:51.190> this<00:05:51.370> is<00:05:51.460> called<00:05:51.699> Dib<00:05:51.940> lean

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
stick to Dibble this is called Dib lean

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.270 
stick to Dibble this is called Dib lean
when<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.750> put<00:05:53.050> make<00:05:53.650> little<00:05:53.860> holes<00:05:53.889> on<00:05:54.159> the

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
when you put make little holes on the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.680 
when you put make little holes on the
ground<00:05:54.460> for<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:54.759> seeds<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.270> you<00:05:55.330> want<00:05:55.509> to<00:05:55.599> go

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
ground for the seeds and you want to go

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.320 
ground for the seeds and you want to go
about<00:05:55.930> twice<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.650> depth<00:05:56.889> of<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.490> seed<00:05:57.729> that's

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
about twice the depth of the seed that's

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.510 
about twice the depth of the seed that's
about<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.690> right<00:05:58.900> depth<00:05:59.259> to<00:05:59.409> plant<00:05:59.650> it<00:05:59.800> at<00:05:59.949> too

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
about the right depth to plant it at too

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.790 
about the right depth to plant it at too
deep<00:06:00.729> and<00:06:01.060> it'll<00:06:01.270> won't<00:06:01.539> come<00:06:01.780> up<00:06:01.960> too<00:06:02.500> shallow

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
deep and it'll won't come up too shallow

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.240 
deep and it'll won't come up too shallow
and<00:06:03.039> it'll<00:06:03.219> dry<00:06:03.490> out<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:04.030> it'll<00:06:04.240> die<00:06:05.159> so<00:06:06.159> we're

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
and it'll dry out and it'll die so we're

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.230 
and it'll dry out and it'll die so we're
just<00:06:06.280> going<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.520> Dibble<00:06:06.820> with<00:06:06.940> some<00:06:07.090> sticks

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
just going to Dibble with some sticks

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.420 
just going to Dibble with some sticks
they<00:06:08.840> have<00:06:09.020> professional<00:06:09.470> doubles<00:06:10.160> but<00:06:10.340> you

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430

kids just use a stick okay so we finish
with<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.259> twine<00:06:15.470> here<00:06:15.520> yeah<00:06:16.520> now<00:06:16.849> some<00:06:17.090> people

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
with the twine here yeah now some people

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.740 
with the twine here yeah now some people
have<00:06:18.020> been<00:06:18.229> told<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:18.740> like<00:06:19.069> tie<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:20.419> stakes

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
have been told to like tie the stakes

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.260 
have been told to like tie the stakes
together<00:06:21.199> and<00:06:21.550> provide<00:06:22.550> more<00:06:22.729> stability<00:06:23.060> for

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
together and provide more stability for

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.320 
together and provide more stability for
the<00:06:23.690> bean<00:06:24.080> teepee<00:06:24.410> but<00:06:24.650> that's<00:06:24.830> not<00:06:24.979> advised

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
the bean teepee but that's not advised

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.850 
the bean teepee but that's not advised
because<00:06:26.330> when<00:06:26.539> these<00:06:26.660> grow<00:06:27.020> you<00:06:27.500> want<00:06:27.680> them<00:06:27.770> to

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
because when these grow you want them to

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.830 
because when these grow you want them to
grow<00:06:28.069> straight<00:06:28.789> up<00:06:28.819> if<00:06:29.210> they<00:06:29.360> have<00:06:29.389> these

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
grow straight up if they have these

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.749 
grow straight up if they have these
cross<00:06:30.139> pieces<00:06:30.440> then<00:06:31.160> they'll<00:06:31.310> grow<00:06:31.430> along

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
cross pieces then they'll grow along

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.309 
cross pieces then they'll grow along
here<00:06:32.060> and<00:06:32.240> they'll<00:06:32.389> go<00:06:32.509> around<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:33.169> and

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
here and they'll go around it and

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.080 
here and they'll go around it and
they'll<00:06:33.470> choke<00:06:33.650> each<00:06:33.830> other<00:06:34.039> out<00:06:34.310> and<00:06:34.940> it

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
they'll choke each other out and it

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.460 
they'll choke each other out and it
won't<00:06:35.180> grow<00:06:35.389> as<00:06:35.539> well<00:06:35.720> so<00:06:35.900> it's<00:06:36.050> not<00:06:36.199> advised

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
won't grow as well so it's not advised

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.830 
won't grow as well so it's not advised
to<00:06:36.680> tie<00:06:36.860> them<00:06:37.009> together<00:06:37.130> okay<00:06:38.000> well<00:06:38.419> our<00:06:38.449> beans

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
to tie them together okay well our beans

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.510 
to tie them together okay well our beans
are<00:06:39.080> going<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.319> germinate<00:06:39.979> in<00:06:40.160> about<00:06:40.340> one<00:06:40.490> to

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
are going to germinate in about one to

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.010 
are going to germinate in about one to
two<00:06:40.789> weeks<00:06:40.909> and<00:06:41.180> at<00:06:41.270> that<00:06:41.419> time<00:06:41.599> we<00:06:41.750> could<00:06:41.900> come

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
two weeks and at that time we could come

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.629 
two weeks and at that time we could come
back<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.440> thin<00:06:42.889> them<00:06:42.949> out<00:06:43.099> to<00:06:43.340> the<00:06:43.460> two

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
back and thin them out to the two

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.850 
back and thin them out to the two
strongest<00:06:44.000> plants<00:06:44.659> okay<00:06:45.259> and<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.500> last<00:06:45.620> thing

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
strongest plants okay and the last thing

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.790 
strongest plants okay and the last thing
we<00:06:45.919> need<00:06:46.069> to<00:06:46.099> do<00:06:46.220> is<00:06:46.370> water<00:06:46.639> these<00:06:46.940> guys<00:06:47.150> in
