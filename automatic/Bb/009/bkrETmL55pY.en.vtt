00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 the audience with you as usual pit dakota it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.930
 My regular review on anime 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 titled titans invasion 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.760
 quite popular work which 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.129
 many causes only admiration and at 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.769
 others , on the contrary, in this video I 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.420
 I will try to tell a little about the plot 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.670
 bohkov and many other things and most importantly 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.290
 find out why viewers say so 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.180
 divided when viewing this 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.980
 TV series the plot extends to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.890
 alternate reality where people lived 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.120
 alone were engaged in everyday affairs 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.769
 there were of course between sits between 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720
 countries but all did not go beyond 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.860
 ordinary 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.500
 however, it is not known where they came from 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.049
 big i would even say just huge 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.390
 humanoid creatures which have become 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.280
 after calling titanium 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.570
 they began to continuously have people at 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.180
 this is not paying attention to the whole 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.159
 the rest of the living matter however 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.020
 the surviving part of the world's population was 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.799
 forced mean yourself for unbelievable 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.360
 big walls protecting even that 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 for hundreds of years the price has been kept but in one 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.009
 beautiful day titan above 50 meters 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 height broke it and here it is all and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.170
 rolled the main character district huntsman his 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 step sister mikasa akerman managed 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 survive stories from not 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 and set a goal to avenge 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.049
 the death of their mother all over the city thereby 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.789
 setting a roar of soldiers into a house plot case 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.609
 I liked not to say that really straight 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.039
 bomb but nevertheless it turned out just 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.320
 great here and awesome action 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.869
 no such snot constantly in the battle 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.240
 there is a continuous movement of the hero then 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.619
 the case of dying is of course not a plus but 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.539
 adds a point to reality 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.579
 what is happening on the screen after reading 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.799
 comments I understood that someone is looking for 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.780
 meaning in these titans and suggests that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.899
 such titanium is for sure in each of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.060
 but we understood one thing for sure and the author 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.400
 tried to convey to us the idea that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 people even being on the verge of doom 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 humanity is not always capable 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.940
 unite in front of a common threat they say 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 there are always gentlemen who are deep 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.830
 shit on ordinary people have 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.750
 injustice and much more but in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.240
 In general, as usual, I did not regret my 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.810
 time and looked at all 25 episodes of this 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.000
 anime 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.520
 and say that I was in some kind of trance 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.880
 after watching I only thought about 10 minutes 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.709
 in all that happened but to lovers 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.010
 genres like fantasy adventures 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.220
 reveal I just strongly recommend 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 This work at the end I will say that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.959
 with you was pit dakota you watched review 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.300
 on it and the invasion of the titans I will note that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.310
 This is only my personal opinion if 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.069
 it is not the same as yours there too 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.810
