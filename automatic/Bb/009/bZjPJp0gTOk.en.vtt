why is that way it's actually very hard
to<00:00:17.789> explain<00:00:17.970> why<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.449> yeah<00:00:18.840> well<00:00:19.140> I'm

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
to explain why because yeah well I'm

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.920 
to explain why because yeah well I'm
gonna<00:00:19.529> show<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.730> did<00:00:20.939> detect<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.689> beam

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
gonna show you we did detect this beam

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.320 
gonna show you we did detect this beam
but<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.560> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.070> americium<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.970> hard

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
but I for show you the americium on hard

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.439 
but I for show you the americium on hard
on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> tetris<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.820> half<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> star

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
on the tetris one we got half a star

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.210 
on the tetris one we got half a star
because<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.380> couldn't<00:00:28.650> figure<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
because we couldn't figure out how it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
because we couldn't figure out how it
works<00:00:29.369> probably<00:00:29.699> cuz<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> movements<00:00:31.109> they

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
works probably cuz the movements they

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
works probably cuz the movements they
give<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> perspective<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.489> makes<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> seem

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
give the perspective it makes it seem

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.220 
give the perspective it makes it seem
like<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.510> left<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> right<00:00:33.960> but

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
like we have to go left and right but

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
like we have to go left and right but
it's<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.620> down<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.160> just<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.550> hard

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it's up and down and it's just it's hard

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's up and down and it's just it's hard
to<00:00:36.030> remember<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.469> down<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
to remember which way up is and down is

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
to remember which way up is and down is
because<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.280> respective<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> left<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> right

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
because the respective is left and right

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.740 
because the respective is left and right
and<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.020> annoying<00:00:41.750> but

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and it was just a bit annoying but

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.279 
and it was just a bit annoying but
basically<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.829> set<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.090> takes<00:00:45.360> way

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
basically you set up and it takes way

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.650 
basically you set up and it takes way
too<00:00:46.320> long<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.340> work<00:00:47.850> out<00:00:48.090> where<00:00:48.329> you're<00:00:48.480> cuz

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
too long to work out where you're cuz

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
too long to work out where you're cuz
like<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.230> hope<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.590> both<00:00:49.739> all<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> remotes

together so you're holding it and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.439 
together so you're holding it and
