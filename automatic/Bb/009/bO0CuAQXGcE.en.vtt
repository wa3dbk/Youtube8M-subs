00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.660
 and try something completely new again 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:14.929
 Let's see if it will turn out like that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.910
 biscuits and bananas blueberries 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:28.590
 oatmeal biocacca lean quark small 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.769
 little way and cookies cream flooring and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.219
 sympathetic too normally again 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 still pure sweetener but I think through 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:42.420
 through the cookies cream become sweet enough 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 I'll give it a try first 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.039
 you cut a banana very small 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.719
 Cube is in a bowl 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.520
 now it is quite another convincing purely 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.129
 I'm going to become a banana I'm 100 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:10.650
 grams of lean quark pure two 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:12.020
 teaspoon baking powder organic cocoa powder 40 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.080
 vanished km / h 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.909
 So 100 grams of blueberries 50 times eggs 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.520
 and then comes cinnamon and cookies 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.369
 cream florian pure 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.479
 Well, let's see how it gets to bake 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.640
 has to go to 200 degrees 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.600
 that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 blueberries sometimes left out 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.820
 So I have no sweetener purely why 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.020
 that tastes really good 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 I already have it without testing 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.869
 So, without interest, good off now 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:55.159
 to be given and then off in the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.159
 oven as well as a venture 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:08.040
 so believe is now comes the whole 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:12.870
 on the baking tray so I'm very curious 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.240
 as I said the first time that makes you 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.040
 Believe the parts will be right 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.280
 I'm curious what I'm still cold 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 Cool something and then I will 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.780
 or two eat the rest with 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.610
 working so long for the really cool 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 i am really and he could 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.350
 until 10 on top of it if yes 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.370
 then eat said I'll try it 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.090
 two the macro 70 easy for it will be 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.000
 taken me to work all the way to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.120
 Purchase made an evening eaten awesome 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 so really nice and juicy by the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:07.350
 blueberries so give it a try 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:10.830
 here are the ingredients 500 70 calories 17 54 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.350
 grams of carbs and 46 compose her 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.160
 can only take the egg whites 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.940
 So I have two eggs now 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.080
 reingemacht 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.570
 there you can if you only aigner 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.709
 then takes 100 grams 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.030
 instead of two whole eggs then you have like that 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.430
 good as no fat then you have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.950
 just five grams of fat 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.610
 the whole portion 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:43.860
 but as I said maximum on the whole day 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.340
 on 55 and the maximum limit 70 years 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.340
