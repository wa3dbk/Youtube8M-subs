00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
of what can help you and then there's
obviously<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:22.229> advanced<00:01:22.740> theory<00:01:22.950> getting

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
obviously more advanced theory getting

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
obviously more advanced theory getting
into<00:01:23.670> different<00:01:24.180> types<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.689> scales<00:01:24.900> and

into different types of scales and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.570 
into different types of scales and

least starting out but I want to just

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
least starting out but I want to just
talk<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> point<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.900> I've<00:01:34.170> mentioned

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
talk about a point that I've mentioned

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.859 
talk about a point that I've mentioned
before<00:01:34.560> learning<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.490> keys<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.240> learning

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
before learning your keys and learning

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
before learning your keys and learning
your<00:01:36.960> scales<00:01:37.020> some<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> might<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your scales some of you might think that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
your scales some of you might think that
that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> daunting<00:01:39.420> task<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.590> so

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that is a daunting task that is so

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
that is a daunting task that is so
difficult<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:42.030> quite<00:01:42.270> honest<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
difficult to do be quite honest you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
difficult to do be quite honest you
could<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.439> away<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.100> earn<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
could really get away if you earn a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.999 
could really get away if you earn a
couple<00:01:44.729> scales<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.720> samplers<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.500> our

instrument things like that ideally you
learn<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> keys<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.240> scales<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
learn all the keys and scales and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.969 
learn all the keys and scales and
there's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.049> simple<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.770> look

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
with no sharps or flats and then from

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.020 
with no sharps or flats and then from
there<00:02:13.530> as<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.770> go<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.190> sharp<00:02:14.580> Keys<00:02:14.790> you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
there as you go into sharp Keys you

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.520 
there as you go into sharp Keys you
progress<00:02:15.240> up<00:02:15.600> from<00:02:15.870> there<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.290> goes<00:02:16.410> on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
progress up from there and that goes on

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.930 
progress up from there and that goes on
the<00:02:16.620> right-hand<00:02:17.010> side<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> circle<00:02:17.700> fist

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the right-hand side of the circle fist

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
the right-hand side of the circle fist
and<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.630> left<00:02:18.840> hand<00:02:18.960> side<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.380> where<00:02:19.500> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
and on the left hand side is where you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
and on the left hand side is where you
go<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.710> your<00:02:19.860> flat<00:02:20.100> cams<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.060> probably

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
go to your flat cams and so you probably

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.380 
go to your flat cams and so you probably
already<00:02:21.600> know<00:02:21.780> middle<00:02:22.080> C<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.700> here<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
already know middle C is right here and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.530 
already know middle C is right here and
so<00:02:24.570> if<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.870> C<00:02:25.320> scale

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.970 

and<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.690> then<00:02:34.840> if<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.019> wanted<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.319> move<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.680> say

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and so then if I wanted to move up say

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.830 
and so then if I wanted to move up say
the<00:02:36.129> first<00:02:36.400> sharp<00:02:36.879> key<00:02:37.060> referring<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the first sharp key referring to the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
the first sharp key referring to the
circle<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.409> that<00:02:38.890> would<00:02:38.980> put<00:02:39.159> me<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.310> G

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
circle of this that would put me in G

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.369 
circle of this that would put me in G
and<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.239> only<00:02:40.360> thing<00:02:40.510> different<00:02:40.659> with<00:02:41.019> G<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
and the only thing different with G is

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.440 
and the only thing different with G is
going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.650> majority<00:02:42.459> all-white<00:02:42.879> notes<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
going to be majority all-white notes and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.369 
going to be majority all-white notes and
then<00:02:43.569> we're<00:02:43.659> just<00:02:43.690> going<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.930> sharp<00:02:44.230> the

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
then we're just going to sharp the

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.020 
then we're just going to sharp the
seventh<00:02:44.799> these<00:02:44.980> scales<00:02:45.280> have<00:02:45.519> eight<00:02:45.760> notes

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
seventh these scales have eight notes

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000 
seventh these scales have eight notes
including<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.720> root<00:02:46.959> key<00:02:47.170> twice<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.920> you're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
including the root key twice so you're

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.770 
including the root key twice so you're
gonna<00:02:48.129> hit<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.280> root<00:02:48.519> key<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.209> beginning<00:02:49.569> and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
gonna hit the root key the beginning and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.509 
gonna hit the root key the beginning and
you're<00:02:49.900> going<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.049> end<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.410> root<00:02:50.590> kick<00:02:50.769> so

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
you're going to end on the root kick so

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.160 
you're going to end on the root kick so
if<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.700> start<00:02:51.940> at<00:02:52.030> G<00:02:54.780> now<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.110> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
if I start at G now I'm going to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.020 
if I start at G now I'm going to
actually<00:02:56.379> sharp<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.549> F<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.790> again<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
actually sharp this F and again the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580 
actually sharp this F and again the
circle<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.390> fists<00:03:04.660> will<00:03:04.780> step<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.140> up<00:03:05.349> through

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
circle of fists will step you up through

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.110 
circle of fists will step you up through
that<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.040> then<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.489> work<00:03:06.670> away<00:03:06.879> on<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
that and then as you work away on the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.670 
that and then as you work away on the
left<00:03:07.359> side<00:03:07.599> you'll<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:08.019> introduced<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
left side you'll be introduced to the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.710 
left side you'll be introduced to the
flat<00:03:08.950> keys<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> first<00:03:10.359> one<00:03:10.540> would<00:03:10.660> be

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
flat keys and so the first one would be

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:22.700 
flat keys and so the first one would be
an<00:03:10.959> F<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.510> we're<00:03:13.599> going<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.750> do<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> b-flat<00:03:14.440> here

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.050 

my<00:03:23.710> personal<00:03:24.160> recommendation<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> way

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
my personal recommendation in the way

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.090 
my personal recommendation in the way
that<00:03:25.240> I<00:03:25.420> learned<00:03:25.780> when<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.200> was<00:03:26.380> taking<00:03:26.740> formal

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
that I learned when I was taking formal

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.580 
that I learned when I was taking formal
lessons<00:03:27.520> was<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.420> do<00:03:28.630> each<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.230> scales

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
lessons was to do each of the scales

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.530 
lessons was to do each of the scales
slower<00:03:30.250> speed<00:03:30.760> obviously<00:03:31.000> when<00:03:31.450> you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
slower speed obviously when you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.870 
slower speed obviously when you're
learning<00:03:31.990> them<00:03:32.140> do<00:03:32.380> them<00:03:32.560> hands<00:03:33.100> independent

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
learning them do them hands independent

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.130 
learning them do them hands independent
you<00:03:33.940> have<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.150> learn<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.450> fingering<00:03:34.840> for<00:03:34.990> your

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
you have to learn the fingering for your

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.990 
you have to learn the fingering for your
right<00:03:35.380> hand<00:03:37.230> for<00:03:38.230> your<00:03:38.290> left<00:03:38.500> hand<00:03:38.740> also

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.850 

and<00:03:42.300> then<00:03:42.810> once<00:03:42.990> you<00:03:43.080> get<00:03:43.230> good<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.710> can

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and then once you get good you can

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.620 
and then once you get good you can
increase<00:03:44.130> speed<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.880> can<00:03:44.910> also<00:03:45.150> do<00:03:45.420> both

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
increase speed and you can also do both

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.340 
increase speed and you can also do both
hands<00:03:50.150> you're<00:03:51.150> probably<00:03:51.390> also<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.080> want

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
hands you're probably also going to want

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.200 
hands you're probably also going to want
to<00:03:52.410> learn<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.830> relative<00:03:53.280> minors<00:03:53.760> they're

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
to learn the relative minors they're

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.670 
to learn the relative minors they're
going<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.720> helpful<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.410> personally

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
going to be very helpful I personally

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.290 
going to be very helpful I personally
create<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.070> majority<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.490> production<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.120> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
create the majority my production in a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.270 
create the majority my production in a
minor<00:03:57.600> key<00:03:57.960> in<00:03:58.200> particular<00:03:58.650> learning<00:03:59.190> your

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
minor key in particular learning your

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.040 
minor key in particular learning your
harmonic<00:03:59.820> minor<00:04:00.000> scales<00:04:00.450> now<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> don't

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
harmonic minor scales now if you don't

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.750 
harmonic minor scales now if you don't
know<00:04:01.170> any<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.530> stuff<00:04:01.590> means<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.310> really

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
know any of this stuff means it's really

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.610 
know any of this stuff means it's really
not<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.060> difficult<00:04:03.510> again<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.380> want<00:04:04.590> to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
not that difficult again I want to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.380 
not that difficult again I want to
encourage<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.430> look<00:04:05.610> up<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.970> circle<00:04:06.300> of

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
encourage you to look up the circle of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.030 
encourage you to look up the circle of
fist<00:04:06.690> there's<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:06.990> lot<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.230> resources<00:04:07.590> also<00:04:07.800> on

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
fist there's a lot of resources also on

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.350 
fist there's a lot of resources also on
the<00:04:08.130> web<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.520> I'll<00:04:08.610> make<00:04:08.730> sure<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.880> link<00:04:09.120> one

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
the web and I'll make sure to link one

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880 
the web and I'll make sure to link one
of<00:04:09.450> those<00:04:09.600> too<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.230> way<00:04:10.380> you'll<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:10.680> more

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
of those too that way you'll have more

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.140 
of those too that way you'll have more
of<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.100> reference<00:04:11.430> or<00:04:11.610> some<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.880> these<00:04:11.940> things

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
of a reference or some of these things

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.520 
of a reference or some of these things
look<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:12.660> instance<00:04:12.930> what<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.200> mean<00:04:13.410> by

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
look for instance what I mean by

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.140 
look for instance what I mean by
relative<00:04:13.770> minor<00:04:14.280> key<00:04:14.520> if<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.760> don't<00:04:14.940> already

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
relative minor key if you don't already

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.750 
relative minor key if you don't already
know<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.990> C<00:04:16.260> major<00:04:16.470> board<00:04:16.859> right<00:04:19.760> like

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
know this is a C major board right like

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.090 
know this is a C major board right like
the<00:04:20.880> C<00:04:21.090> major<00:04:21.269> triad<00:04:21.600> but<00:04:22.200> also<00:04:22.380> following

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
the C major triad but also following

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.430 
the C major triad but also following
very<00:04:23.310> similar<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.210> scale<00:04:24.540> is<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> relative

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
very similar to this scale is a relative

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.230 
very similar to this scale is a relative
minor<00:04:25.980> key<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.610> case<00:04:26.790> it's<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> be

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
minor key in this case it's going to be

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.210 
minor key in this case it's going to be
an<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.630> minor<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.590> hear<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.980> major

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
an a minor and so you hear the major

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.900 
an a minor and so you hear the major
sound<00:04:29.790> here<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:31.530> now<00:04:31.680> if<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.890> drop<00:04:32.250> down<00:04:32.460> three

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
sound here and now if I drop down three

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.240 
sound here and now if I drop down three
half<00:04:33.120> steps<00:04:33.480> which<00:04:33.720> means<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.950> two<00:04:36.200> three<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
half steps which means one two three the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.340 
half steps which means one two three the
relative<00:04:38.580> minor<00:04:38.850> is<00:04:39.060> going<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.270> be<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.390> minor<00:04:39.840> so

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
relative minor is going to be a minor so

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.720 
relative minor is going to be a minor so
if<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.500> play<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:40.830> minor<00:04:41.130> triad

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.920 

you<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.850> definitely<00:04:45.000> hear<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.390> dairy<00:04:45.600> swing

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
you can definitely hear the dairy swing

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.270 
you can definitely hear the dairy swing
the<00:04:47.000> major<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.360> minor<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.800> basically<00:04:50.100> the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
the major in the minor so basically the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.620 
the major in the minor so basically the
relative<00:04:50.670> minor<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:51.090> going<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.270> follow<00:04:51.450> the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
relative minor is going to follow the

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.900 
relative minor is going to follow the
same<00:04:51.840> scale<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:52.500> if<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:52.950> play<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.310> harmonic

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
same scale and if I play the harmonic

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.520 
same scale and if I play the harmonic
minor<00:04:54.090> I'm<00:04:54.450> actually<00:04:54.600> going<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.960> raise<00:04:55.200> the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
minor I'm actually going to raise the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.990 
minor I'm actually going to raise the
seventh<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:56.070> what<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.280> means<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.580> if<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.760> play

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
seventh so what that means is if I play

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.270 
seventh so what that means is if I play
a<00:04:57.030> natural<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.900> minor<00:04:58.350> scale<00:04:58.710> I'm<00:04:58.980> just<00:04:59.160> going

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
a natural a minor scale I'm just going

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.860 
a natural a minor scale I'm just going
to<00:04:59.310> play<00:04:59.490> an<00:04:59.580> all-white<00:05:00.000> key<00:05:00.240> like<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.600> played

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
to play an all-white key like I played

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.930 
to play an all-white key like I played
for<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.560> C<00:05:01.710> major<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.400> would<00:05:02.580> be

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.880 

know<00:05:08.630> any<00:05:08.870> different<00:05:09.140> that<00:05:09.170> you<00:05:09.290> do<00:05:09.470> with<00:05:09.680> the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
know any different that you do with the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.340 
know any different that you do with the
harmonic<00:05:10.550> minor<00:05:10.760> is<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.450> raise<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.840> set<00:05:12.050> so

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
harmonic minor is you raise the set so

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.230 
harmonic minor is you raise the set so
we'll<00:05:12.500> go<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.830> this

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.600 

no<00:05:16.690> g-sharp

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.680 

so<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.640> was<00:05:24.760> basically<00:05:24.880> just<00:05:25.180> demonstrated

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
so I was basically just demonstrated

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.570 
so I was basically just demonstrated
using<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:25.990> C<00:05:26.170> major<00:05:26.350> scale<00:05:26.470> as<00:05:26.830> an<00:05:26.950> example<00:05:27.250> in

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
using the C major scale as an example in

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.700 
using the C major scale as an example in
a<00:05:27.670> relative<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.150> minor<00:05:28.510> harmonic<00:05:28.870> scale<00:05:29.380> but

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
a relative a minor harmonic scale but

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.320 
a relative a minor harmonic scale but
the<00:05:29.800> same<00:05:30.010> principle<00:05:30.460> applies<00:05:30.670> for<00:05:31.000> all<00:05:31.120> your

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
the same principle applies for all your

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.760 
the same principle applies for all your
scales<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:31.840> once<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.080> learn<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:32.350> major<00:05:32.500> scale

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
scales so once you learn the major scale

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.270 
scales so once you learn the major scale
whether<00:05:32.980> it<00:05:33.070> be<00:05:33.190> C<00:05:33.460> G<00:05:34.240> D<00:05:34.720> a<00:05:35.050> as<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.710> progress<00:05:35.920> up

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
whether it be C G D a as you progress up

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.620 
whether it be C G D a as you progress up
on<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> sharp<00:05:36.730> side<00:05:36.970> you're<00:05:37.270> going<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.450> have<00:05:37.600> a

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
on the sharp side you're going to have a

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.570 
on the sharp side you're going to have a
relative<00:05:38.290> minor<00:05:38.560> key<00:05:38.920> in<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.370> way<00:05:39.520> to

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
relative minor key in the way to

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.520 
relative minor key in the way to
identify<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.270> minor<00:05:40.570> key<00:05:40.870> that's<00:05:41.080> relative

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
identify that minor key that's relative

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.920 
identify that minor key that's relative
to<00:05:41.620> that<00:05:41.770> major<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.310> you<00:05:42.430> drop<00:05:42.760> down<00:05:43.120> three

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
to that major is you drop down three

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.050 
to that major is you drop down three
half<00:05:44.200> steps<00:05:44.560> from<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.070> major<00:05:45.310> root<00:05:45.640> key<00:05:45.850> and

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
half steps from the major root key and

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.150 
half steps from the major root key and
so<00:05:46.210> again<00:05:46.480> I<00:05:46.540> just<00:05:46.810> want<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.050> re-emphasize

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
so again I just want to re-emphasize

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.790 
so again I just want to re-emphasize
let's<00:05:48.160> start<00:05:48.400> with<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.610> G<00:05:48.820> Major<00:05:49.030> scale

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.870 

okay<00:05:55.800> now<00:05:55.980> if<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:56.130> want<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.370> find<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.700> relative

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
okay now if I want to find the relative

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.210 
okay now if I want to find the relative
monitor<00:05:57.660> this<00:05:57.840> g-major<00:05:58.290> what<00:05:58.950> I'm<00:05:59.040> going<00:05:59.190> to

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
monitor this g-major what I'm going to

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.130 
monitor this g-major what I'm going to
do<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.670> drop<00:05:59.910> down<00:06:00.120> three<00:06:00.450> half<00:06:00.690> steps<00:06:01.020> from

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
do is drop down three half steps from

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.050 
do is drop down three half steps from
the<00:06:01.320> root<00:06:01.530> key<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.920> if<00:06:02.340> you<00:06:02.460> don't<00:06:02.730> know<00:06:02.880> what

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
the root key and if you don't know what

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.490 
the root key and if you don't know what
a<00:06:03.090> half<00:06:03.330> step<00:06:03.600> is<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.990> means<00:06:04.200> that's<00:06:04.410> the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
a half step is that means that's the

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.740 
a half step is that means that's the
nearest<00:06:05.010> point<00:06:05.310> from<00:06:05.580> this<00:06:05.940> particular<00:06:06.300> note

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
nearest point from this particular note

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.210 
nearest point from this particular note
so<00:06:07.020> from<00:06:07.230> here<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.530> here<00:06:07.740> would<00:06:07.860> be<00:06:07.980> a<00:06:08.010> half

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
so from here to here would be a half

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.250 
so from here to here would be a half
step<00:06:08.250> from<00:06:08.790> here<00:06:09.390> to<00:06:09.480> here<00:06:09.690> would<00:06:09.810> I<00:06:09.870> be<00:06:10.020> a<00:06:10.050> half

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
step from here to here would I be a half

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.750 
step from here to here would I be a half
step<00:06:10.290> and<00:06:10.800> from<00:06:11.040> here<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.310> here<00:06:11.340> would<00:06:11.610> be<00:06:11.730> a

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
step and from here to here would be a

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.210 
step and from here to here would be a
half<00:06:11.970> step<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.360> if<00:06:12.450> I<00:06:12.480> go<00:06:12.600> from<00:06:12.630> G<00:06:13.080> I<00:06:13.440> go<00:06:13.800> one<00:06:14.190> two

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
half step so if I go from G I go one two

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.090 
half step so if I go from G I go one two
three<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.570> now<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.440> can<00:06:16.650> denta<00:06:16.830> Phi<00:06:16.950> that's

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
three and now I can denta Phi that's

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.650 
three and now I can denta Phi that's
going<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:17.370> be<00:06:17.490> an<00:06:17.580> e<00:06:17.850> monitor<00:06:18.300> is<00:06:18.390> going<00:06:18.420> to<00:06:18.570> be

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
going to be an e monitor is going to be

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.940 
going to be an e monitor is going to be
a<00:06:18.690> relative<00:06:19.200> minor<00:06:19.890> to<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.310> G<00:06:20.490> major<00:06:21.830> so<00:06:22.830> if<00:06:22.890> I

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
a relative minor to that G major so if I

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.220 
a relative minor to that G major so if I
follow<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.310> same<00:06:23.370> formula<00:06:23.850> from<00:06:24.300> G<00:06:24.690> what<00:06:25.200> I

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
follow the same formula from G what I

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.590 
follow the same formula from G what I
did<00:06:25.470> was<00:06:25.650> I<00:06:25.770> sharp<00:06:26.130> the<00:06:26.460> F<00:06:26.640> which<00:06:26.940> was<00:06:27.090> my<00:06:27.210> seven

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
did was I sharp the F which was my seven

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.000 
did was I sharp the F which was my seven
but<00:06:27.780> when<00:06:27.870> I<00:06:27.900> started<00:06:28.200> on<00:06:28.260> it's<00:06:28.620> actually<00:06:28.740> the

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
but when I started on it's actually the

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.110 
but when I started on it's actually the
second<00:06:29.430> note<00:06:29.580> that<00:06:29.760> I'm<00:06:29.850> going<00:06:29.970> to<00:06:30.000> be

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
second note that I'm going to be

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.640 
second note that I'm going to be
sharping

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.000 

you

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.080 

so<00:06:38.010> that's<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.280> natural<00:06:38.610> scale<00:06:38.790> and<00:06:38.940> if<00:06:39.000> I

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
so that's the natural scale and if I

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.550 
so that's the natural scale and if I
introduce<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.480> harmonic<00:06:40.200> I'm<00:06:40.320> going<00:06:40.470> to

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
introduce the harmonic I'm going to

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:51.540 
introduce the harmonic I'm going to
