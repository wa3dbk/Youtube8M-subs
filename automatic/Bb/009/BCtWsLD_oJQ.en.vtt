00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 all right 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.070
 and jimÃ©nez of crafts 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.759
 we are going to need an orange leaf 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 a few black sheets and one 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.489
 Cardboard of any color that you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.869
 want 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.190
 this is the one we are going to use for the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.300
 scarf scissors and I used a plate and a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.300
 glass for measurements 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.900
 let's take our black cardboard 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.900
 let's trace the little eyes 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.899
 for me the eyes 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 A deep plate 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.670
 one 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.609
 and the footprints 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.420
 here it is important that checks of what 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.580
 size is your door 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.590
 so you can see what size you are going to make 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.760
 my eyes before I choose the size 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.940
 of the eyes I gave myself the plate 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.730
 at the door and then for the little buttons 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.730
 and the mouth I chose this glass 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 and I'm going to draw the right thing here to not 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.230
 waste the role of these 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.040
 Circulitos we will need 9 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.340
 that we're going to use four for the buttons 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.600
 Y 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 5 for the mouth 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.240
 and that 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 we have our visit 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.600
 our smile and buttons and eyes and 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.509
 here are the human the scarf more or 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.310
 less is 15 centimeters tall and you 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.289
 measure your door so you can see how much is going to 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.209
 measure in width 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.239
 now we are going to deny our doll 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.239
 snow 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 a small space so you can 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.630
 use and do not forget to send us a 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.710
