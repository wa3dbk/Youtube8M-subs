really<00:01:26.170> really<00:01:26.800> old<00:01:27.190> right<00:01:27.640> now<00:01:27.880> dosbox<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:29.080> a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
really really old right now dosbox is a

really really old right now dosbox is a

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
Doss emulation program meaning that this

Doss emulation program meaning that this
operating<00:01:33.369> system<00:01:33.970> is<00:01:34.149> so<00:01:34.660> old<00:01:35.080> that<00:01:35.649> it

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
operating system is so old that it

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.520 
operating system is so old that it
requires<00:01:36.429> an<00:01:36.729> emulator<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.569> actually<00:01:38.259> run

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
requires an emulator to actually run

requires an emulator to actually run
what<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.340> this<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.729> Commodore<00:01:40.209> 64<00:01:40.899> or<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
what is this the Commodore 64 or the

belly Sinclair yeah anyway back to the
emulator<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.690> many<00:01:46.959> who<00:01:47.229> have<00:01:47.380> used<00:01:47.410> das<00:01:47.950> in

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
emulator like many who have used das in

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.040 
emulator like many who have used das in
the<00:01:48.280> past<00:01:48.550> when<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.060> first<00:01:49.450> opened<00:01:49.750> this

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
the past when I first opened this

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.749 
the past when I first opened this
program<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.740> uttered<00:01:50.950> something<00:01:51.399> along<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
program I uttered something along the

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.249 
program I uttered something along the
lines<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.270> uh<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> stared<00:01:55.690> blankly<00:01:55.899> at<00:01:56.229> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
lines of uh and stared blankly at the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.980 
lines of uh and stared blankly at the
screen<00:01:56.619> however<00:01:57.369> getting<00:01:57.789> dosed<00:01:58.179> to<00:01:58.479> Ron<00:01:58.690> is

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
screen however getting dosed to Ron is

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.380 
screen however getting dosed to Ron is
fairly<00:01:59.319> easy<00:01:59.610> provided<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.700> actually<00:02:01.209> know

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
fairly easy provided you actually know

fairly easy provided you actually know
what<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:01.690> do<00:02:01.840> first<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:02.619> using<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.100> program

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
what to do first for using the program

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.820 
what to do first for using the program
you<00:02:03.880> need<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.119> first<00:02:04.300> go<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.840> sea<00:02:05.259> drop<00:02:05.619> and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
you need to first go to the sea drop and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.300 
you need to first go to the sea drop and
create<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.610> folder<00:02:06.880> labeled<00:02:07.110> D<00:02:08.110> G<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.250> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
create a folder labeled D G this is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.380 
create a folder labeled D G this is
where<00:02:09.580> you're<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.910> put<00:02:10.030> all<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.179> your

dos games now whenever you put a game in
here<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.599> need<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.050> use<00:02:14.349> two<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:14.680> so

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
here you need to just use two or so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
initials for the game I presume we have

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.040

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
let's face it having it up there makes

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.690 
let's face it having it up there makes
it<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> lot<00:04:07.960> easier<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.530> spell<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.460> that's

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
it a lot easier to spell and that's

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.390 
it a lot easier to spell and that's
really<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.240> goes<00:04:10.660> in<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.200> dos<00:04:11.500> box<00:04:11.830> now

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
really all that goes in to dos box now

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.460 
really all that goes in to dos box now
there<00:04:12.700> are<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.880> few<00:04:13.300> other<00:04:13.570> troubleshooting

just<00:04:51.130> pointing<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.790> clicking<00:04:51.820> but<00:04:52.780> this<00:04:52.960> was

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
just pointing and clicking but this was

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.560 
just pointing and clicking but this was
all<00:04:53.320> text<00:04:53.740> based<00:04:53.980> and<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.790> is<00:04:54.880> really<00:04:55.150> hard<00:04:55.390> to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
all text based and it is really hard to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.600 
all text based and it is really hard to
go<00:04:55.690> back<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.230> type<00:04:56.560> of<00:04:56.590> operating<00:04:57.130> system

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610

what's<00:04:58.060> really<00:04:58.240> bad<00:04:58.480> is<00:04:58.540> when<00:04:58.900> i<00:04:58.930> was<00:04:59.230> younger

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530

what's really bad is when i was younger
i<00:04:59.650> actually<00:05:00.370> knew<00:05:00.610> how<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:00.970> use<00:05:01.390> this

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
i actually knew how to use this

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.260 
i actually knew how to use this
operating<00:05:02.170> system<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:03.190> much<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:03.790> i<00:05:04.120> was

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
operating system so much so that i was

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.840 
operating system so much so that i was
able<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.600> program<00:05:04.900> a<00:05:05.260> little<00:05:05.530> menu<00:05:05.740> system<00:05:06.310> so

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
able to program a little menu system so

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.580
