00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 what is a wrong rod and why 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 is it there at all so a wrong one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 This is how it looks 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.550
 from the front at least from behind where 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.340
 is this thing ever there 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.630
 usually if you have a new one now 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.609
 round starts or a new series and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 you want to crochet in chopsticks 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.680
 you usually start with two or three 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 with three air and if you go now 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:45.289
 continue to crochet if you continue now 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:51.960
 chopsticks works then sees the whole thing 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:56.160
 so the beginning just looks different 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 out of white the actual mesh and the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 we can prevent it instead of the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.250
 air mesh a wrong chopsticks here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.660
 know why is it called wrong 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.880
 chopsticks not just chopsticks 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.340
 it 's about that it's not possible 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 Chopsticks is working 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.979
 as follows at the beginning of the series 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.420
 we pull the air mass a bit longer 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.000
 he gets it then according to experience 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.119
 how much longer does that have to be? 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 then just try it best and 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 It will definitely work then 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 I hold this with my finger 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.520
 so that does not slippage me and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.180
 then I move the hook around this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.180
 air masses 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.700
 so do not deceive now practically 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.900
 chopsticks because now this envelope 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.300
 of course, that's the yarn on the hook 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.540
 pull it up under there have two 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.640
 fetch bottles on the hook thread 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.310
 pull through these two and thereby 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.149
 we made a wrong walk in 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 Now I just enter 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.630
 continue on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.929
 The chopsticks can see that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:17.610
 be so completely normal because changes would 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:22.920
 Nothing is just for now 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.050
 the beginning of the round and I'll show you 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.530
 Now, for a moment, how the whole thing looks like 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:36.050
 if you have the air mass so short now 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 choose or too long picture as you see 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.489
 that's the way it starts and it falls 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.280
 just a lot less 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.310
 typical two or three stitches ok if 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.739
 we are here right now at the beginning of a wrong 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 want to make chopsticks and the air 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.780
 Mesh is too short so relate it 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.700
 not high but this maybe only 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.590
 so now I try around it 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.600
 come see you hook does not come 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.580
 So right around drum team there 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.390
 but it's not really 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:16.640
 leave space and then later 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.640
 The rods crochet if that was too short 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.739
 or is it so that the chopsticks to yourself 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.930
 usually much much higher than this 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.650
 wrong chopsticks at the beginning and there are 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.989
 then just an ugly transition 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.560
 and if you make it too long for me 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.820
 that you see going to do for example so 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.530
 that it was right because I was 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.299
 I can not do that here and there 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.320
 then I finish that then that is 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.269
 so larifari so that will be 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.430
 nothing and then they are 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.549
 actual chopsticks way too short and 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 Here you have even possible that 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.850
 she looks nice every day 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.260
 you can not do exactly say so and 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.829
 so many millimeters and so many 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.019
 centimeter 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.600
 that's the same with everyone 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.310
 Hook always different so you get that 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.660
 In any case, I would go now 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.360
 maybe say so 33 hooks thick 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.760
 So three or four hooks look 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.510
 look at the hook here fits now 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.810
 three times in 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.520
 yes, and if you are such a free one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.710
 chopsticks finished then pay attention 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.470
 that next chopsticks are not in this one 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.280
 wrapping mesh so not the first one 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.510
 what you see but the second then 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.700
 are you right and the first one? 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.360
 woman is still one of the wrong ones 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.480
 rod 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.160
 I hope that was helpful and 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.280
 Although we do not love anything anymore 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.280
 then
