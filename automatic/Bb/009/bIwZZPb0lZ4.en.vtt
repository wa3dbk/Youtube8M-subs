00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:17.240
 for a vegetable garden on the balcony already been a lot 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.400
 simple i bought these vascons and le 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.830
 so many company companies of hand branch 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.350
 and now what are you doing some but 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.090
 removed a girl and that are the 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.910
 females and years I do not see here 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.150
 has still remained these will be read 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.579
 minelle and why you have to take them off because 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.950
 they are unproductive branches or or 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.739
 will lead to the formation of very few 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.989
 or even no fruit wi fi carlo 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 you can find yourself enough that you compete 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.980
 now at its base and I'll show you 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.470
 barbarous but I got my fingers dirty 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.399
 green don't worry them a little more 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.660
 skin 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.570
 now you know that you turn off what you have 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.480
 green thumb but I'll go away but if a little 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.519
 on the other hand you now feel the bond 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.890
 tomatoes theme helps you here is how 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.409
 resume the yellow string on the 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.180
 stick these are but you sure that 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.100
 will be fine, unfortunately they are not elastic 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.440
 they must be elastic looks like this 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.930
 it makes a knot but leaves it a little wide 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.909
 so as to allow the plant to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.909
 to grow and not to strangle the place 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:37.160
 I want to try it too, but how much can 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.230
 grow a plant like this 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.890
 these varieties healthy growth 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.880
 indeterminate can grow 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.730
 a lot and how many tomatoes would make one 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.610
 plant so six pounds of tomatoes per 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.310
 every plant is six kilos but it's not really 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.780
 a garden on the balcony sure looks that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.400
 flowers and how it now caresses them 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.140
 because gently stroking cables 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.690
 of tomato favor pollination 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.790
 and consequently the formation of others 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.800
 troops 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.440
 barbara but besides the fertilizer what else 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.150
 we can do to make them grow well 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.790
 manuela it is important to protect the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.970
 plants from pests for example we can 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.680
 use these colored francs 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.070
 sticky ca dragon a serious septa la 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.070
 China 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 this tool does not pollute the product 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.220
 in fact my tomatoes are healthy and 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.980
 genuine 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 among other things, it's lunch time you say 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.180
 to make yourself a beautiful Capri perhaps from 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.180
 those men on that other plant
