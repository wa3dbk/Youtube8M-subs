00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:23.100
 good morning sports fans present from 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 the old forge for ea sports and at 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 this series of videos must always be on 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.189
 Maybe you know a song from 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 night cry the song three lie yes 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.649
 without meanwhile are lying number 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 four arrived 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.329
 that does not fit in the song anymore 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.309
 still have some lies to tell us so 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.890
 are you listening to the eleven? 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.800
 lies and myths of the mainstream 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.280
 Nutrition dear listener so the topic 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.969
 Today too much protein is harmful 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.969
 for the kidneys 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 march never heard of without 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 fucking protein mast around a god totally 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.180
 dreadful 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.100
 on the other side, the argument 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 that makes him break her that leads to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 push the pako okay we go there completely 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 ran very short 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 I believe that by now, yes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.439
 both enough literature and enough 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.720
 general knowledge that it just one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.290
 Sure, that's not really tenable 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.509
 as or just not true 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.829
 it is not true that so to speak 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 now again the other argumentation 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.240
 we would always be very much anyway 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.119
 have fed tearfully and that 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.729
 that's why no problem is true 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 on the plump ones so there are so to speak 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.579
 he does things where then the fat than 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.680
 dominant marco nutrient foreground 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.110
 stood and I protrude fat but 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 fat protein content so to speak in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.549
 high is okay but no matter how 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.049
 how is one at all to this one 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.640
 statements have been made there were studies 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.990
 made with people already in theirs 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.280
 they already had 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.200
 damage had in the kidneys or 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.180
 maybe even a halfway 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.489
 functioning kidney and then have 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 protein levels over certain periods of time 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.200
 got as we are so rather in the field 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.569
 of 5 67 grams per kilogram 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 Bodyweight can settle what 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.660
 of course two things against him 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.430
 Firstly, it included a great deal 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.250
 energy and secondly just like that 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 incredible amounts of protein so if 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.150
 you extrapolate that to yourself 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.730
 80 kilograms of people would be five grams 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.150
 protein per kilo body weight 400 grams 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.190
 protein in the day that means we would have here 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.930
 1600 kilocalories in pure about ai weiweis 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.610
 Lord will be difficult then at all 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.349
 other micronutrients too 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.840
 take at 80 kilo who knows then you have 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.370
 maybe another 1000 calories left 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.660
 the relationship will be in any case 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.790
 not vote at all 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.030
 very clear and then of course we have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.519
 also had problems with the kidney because 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.349
 already an insufficiency exists 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.510
 meanwhile there are lots of studies 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.830
 the show that at functional 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.390
 kidneys and above all else 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.760
 ordinary sufficient 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.790
 No fluid intake at all 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.000
 problems exist the orientation the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.040
 both we sports and me 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.989
 personally is always two again 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.690
 grams of protein per kilo of body weight for 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.450
 the development of musculature and also for 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.090
 Nobody really needs it anymore 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.670
 and there are definitely none 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.220
 problems with too much protein for the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.290
 that means it is even quite clipped 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.500
 and clearly shown that a low 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.659
 Protein costs definitely for the problem 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.580
 body composition harbors yes 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.989
 You will be in a sample of protein 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.180
 reduced cost so synonymous with a 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.430
 low calorie cost ahead of some 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.409
 musculature and even bone mass 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.170
 also lose for the education of 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.970
 Bone mass is, so to speak, the protein 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.860
 also as a carrier of minerals, so to speak 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.620
 important yes that's just completely 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.590
 most of all one of our two 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.030
 essential micronutrients you have to 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.430
 always keep in mind 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.409
 Essential means we have to do that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.599
 we can not record that in that 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.569
 to measure how we need it ourselves 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.580
 So the amino acids according to the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.870
 means two grams of protein per kilo 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.400
 Body weight will not hurt anyone 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.750
 and that is for the kidneys at all 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.780
 no problem even if you think about it 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.250
 In addition, this is what counts for you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.090
 maybe even by what that too 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.930
 would mean 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.380
 permanently take more protein 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.360
 For example, 500 grams of protein per 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.780
 day what that would mean for you there 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.860
 added topic fluid intake 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.750
 also very important there are so 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.419
 general recommendation and there is mine 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.930
 Recommendations a bit higher 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.960
 that means I say you per 20 kilograms 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.970
 Body weight apologizes one kilogram 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.550
 a liter of water a day 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.949
 that means for five kilo people five 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.960
 liter of water outside of sporty 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.990
 activity has at most one 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.699
 side effect for berlin their 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.130
 so dear friends washed through 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.500
 Drinking a lot is incredible 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.470
 important to maybe just as well 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 another own video that was mitos 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.130
 Number four too much protein is harmful 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.169
 for the kidneys 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.210
 we'll meet at the fifth mythos 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.919
 thanks again for watching new 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.919
 title for wii sports
