know<00:03:53.350> obviously<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.920> dual<00:03:54.100> core<00:03:54.400> processor<00:03:54.430> a

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
know obviously the dual core processor a

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.460 
know obviously the dual core processor a
5<00:03:55.269> but<00:03:55.570> also<00:03:55.810> an<00:03:56.260> 8<00:03:56.739> megapixel<00:03:57.010> camera<00:03:57.910> and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
what else yeah 8mm pixel camera and one

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.580 
what else yeah 8mm pixel camera and one
gigabyte<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:03.010> ram<00:04:03.280> increase<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.630> me<00:04:04.780> maybe<00:04:05.500> I

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
gigabyte of ram increase the me maybe I

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.080 
gigabyte of ram increase the me maybe I
prefer<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.130> also<00:04:06.489> going<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.700> have<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.970> but

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
prefer is also going to have that but

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.720 
prefer is also going to have that but
that's<00:04:07.299> just<00:04:07.390> my<00:04:07.570> speculation<00:04:07.840> right<00:04:08.830> now<00:04:08.860> how

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
I would like it to go down because then
