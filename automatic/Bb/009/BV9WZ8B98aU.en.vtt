00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
revamped update on the old classic but

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.590 
revamped update on the old classic but
it's<00:01:24.189> still<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.520> ideal<00:01:24.850> frame<00:01:25.149> for<00:01:25.359> players

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
it's still the ideal frame for players

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's still the ideal frame for players
with<00:01:25.869> traditional<00:01:26.350> strokes<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.920> plenty<00:01:27.219> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.380 
their own power the 90 square inch head
size<00:01:30.009> is<00:01:30.189> unforgiving<00:01:30.820> if<00:01:30.939> you're<00:01:31.060> not<00:01:31.210> used

to it but I found it provides

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.560 
to it but I found it provides
exceptional<00:01:33.399> feel<00:01:33.640> for<00:01:33.820> both<00:01:33.969> the<00:01:34.090> baseline
