00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.510
 in gerardo e 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.910
 you liked who advanced as we call him 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.429
 take it out pedacera advanced in the end not the 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.330
 favorites indeed although the 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.160
 people from chivas de querétaro de pachuca 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.100
 and saints I do not believe in the study but if 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.769
 what is terrible is also to see how 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.259
 it has been worth it will be not to the party 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.640
 end of the tournament where the team number 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.080
 one better tigers would not have entered the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.419
 liguilla had not become imbeciles 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.519
 because they wanted to throw the tie 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.860
 the garbage since they started they managed it 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.739
 they did it without a doubt and we will be 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.190
 reviewing because everything says that I am a 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.449
 I'm a fan of this matter and that everything has been 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.129
 in relation to the arbitration of Roberto 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.489
 Garcia Orozco because the reality is 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:49.539
 It is a guy who knows complex 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.820
 superiority wanted to mark a milestone in its 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.699
 story that went very wrong it came out 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.109
 pretty bad because it 's the criminal market 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.480
 at the end of the match it can be 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.699
 debatable or not what is debatable is 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.789
 that an arbitrator has distinctions 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.620
 totally different in the same party 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.840
 of soccer with plays exactly 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.800
 equal and there's the sample that the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.350
 videos 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.390
 with very clear saline hands with 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.040
 hands that the referee is one meter and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.960
 says it does not intervene that it is not 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.450
 deliberate and when the decision comes 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 final to be able to score and to be able to 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.530
 eliminate a team then there the brand 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.920
 with pity the truth that I think 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.700
 ridiculous a complex totally of 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.980
 superiority of this referee I want 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.290
 show the world that the 92 minute you 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.270
 can mark a penalty that is right is 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 can mark and if it had been very clear 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.360
 Of course he has to mark it but 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.790
 must also be marked the other 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.490
 that's the louis discussion that's the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.400
 core point of this matter is not that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 it will be marked accordingly 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.580
 investigation goes around that in a 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.800
 football game decisions fully 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.930
 found to plays very but very 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.140
 similar agreement generated but after 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.590
 start with this campaign like I do not think 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.560
 I was marked by Roberto García 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.280
 tried to do in a premeditated way 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.899
 to be me, I'm the one who sent me 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.899
 he does so because he was wrong 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.030
 ar - pachuca without defending Roberto 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.220
 analyzing the game roberto has 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.650
 bad decisions because yesterday he was very 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.060
 bad or it was bad but even the a 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 same I think it is not to harm 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.780
 a team sadly for the fans 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.360
 of America ends up hurting us 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.890
 final in a criminal that if it is criminal that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.840
 it is not because there is if you have 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.910
 clear invented that it is criminal that there 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.410
 marked us is different but it was 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.820
 criminal because the hand is in a place 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.190
 where it should not have been but that 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's not something new, it's not clear that has those 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.540
 first penalties other now the mistake 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.910
 yesterday from america is not knowing how to handle a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.830
 result in america better match 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.150
 after the expulsion of golf with goal 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.130
 had come twice if not me 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 I'm wrong when you stay with 10 plays 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.270
 better bet for a much more match 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.310
 offensive has a spectacular match 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.470
 he hit because he makes a historic goal 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.750
 for the america the problem is that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.070
 up down the pawn defend and not nothing 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.960
 more that they end up losing the game if 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.030
 reconsider the criterion and courage 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.130
 that has roberto carlos to have 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.280
 marked the criminal again to meet a 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.360
 because it does not mark others that under that same 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.600
 but theme 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.550
 thanks for nothing I know it or I think 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.470
 not by bad or not you got well the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.470
 play does not judge it I know why it will be 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.000
 for harming America but rather 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:39.070
 why they will not say helped the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.190
 america if you know how to say did not mark it 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.060
 or marked it to help the America 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.350
 bothered is that you see here we go back to 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.090
 gerardo bullet of criticism with the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.190
 referee I do not know is if I 'm watching 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.720
 Of course , nothing happens if people 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.760
 will see it is clear it is marked and I do not 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.280
 help anyone we will let you go for 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.220
 that they continue crying the defeat of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.170
 america if it is a failure so assume it 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.250
 all in america but already tomorrow here 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.250
 you will be in the studio 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.780
 despite trying we will be expanding all 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.269
 these topics with rafa with you louis and 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.530
 then at night already also making a 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.500
 what counts are the semifinals 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.370
 of totally strange Mexican football 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.120
 to what we could perceive when 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.520
 formed the eight teams of the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.080
 liguilla never really thought about anyone and 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.300
 whoever has thought that in these 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.940
 four teams in the semifinals the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.259
 true my respect is if someone could 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.199
 have bet from before I do not think that 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:40.720
 nobody has guessed right I think the 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.160
 application of the hank now the the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.840
 hot group has won a lot of money 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.060
 because every bet it seemed 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.590
 different from what was reality in order 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.539
 let's see how it behaves 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.280
 semifinals I think that the case of 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.380
 Chivas makes it attractive 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.330
 others are very local equipment teams 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.130
 very regional that do not really raise 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.050
 no passion, no interest 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.970
 national but that at the end 4 are there 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.220
 they are there because in this damn tournament 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.840
 Well, everything can happen, so let's go 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.340
 to return to the studio and tomorrow 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.289
 We will be at 3 in the afternoon with everyone 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.289
 you perfect thanks gerardo
