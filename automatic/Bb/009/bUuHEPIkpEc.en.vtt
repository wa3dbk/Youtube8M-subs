00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
hi my name is Donna Lynn Lefevre and now

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.000 
hi my name is Donna Lynn Lefevre and now
we're<00:00:06.629> ready<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.870> move<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> totally

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we're ready to move on to a totally

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.830 
we're ready to move on to a totally
different<00:00:08.400> kind<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.760> finish<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.809> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
different kind of finish this is a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.330 
different kind of finish this is a
plastic<00:00:10.170> finish<00:00:10.650> we're<00:00:10.950> gonna<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
plastic finish we're gonna do a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.789 
plastic finish we're gonna do a
subtractive<00:00:12.179> method<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.349> basically

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
subtractive method and that basically

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.650 
subtractive method and that basically
means<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.280> glaze<00:00:14.549> goes<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.000> first

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
means the glaze goes on first

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.109 
means the glaze goes on first
then<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.260> put<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.650> plate<00:00:17.190> plastic<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
then we put the plate plastic on and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.410 
then we put the plate plastic on and
remove<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.939> we're<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.029> start<00:00:21.300> with<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
remove it so we're gonna start with a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.820 
remove it so we're gonna start with a
different<00:00:21.779> color<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.080> time<00:00:22.140> we're<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.500> do

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
different color this time we're gonna do

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.230 
different color this time we're gonna do
green<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.490> first<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> start

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
green and the first one I want to start

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.689 
green and the first one I want to start
with<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.510> saran<00:00:24.869> wrap<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.490> kind

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
with this saran wrap it's actually kind

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.150 
with this saran wrap it's actually kind
of<00:00:26.760> cool<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> just

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
of cool to do so what you do is you just

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.810 
of cool to do so what you do is you just
put<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.730> glaze<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:31.439> cover<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:32.070> surface

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
put your glaze on you cover your surface

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
put your glaze on you cover your surface
I<00:00:33.750> don't<00:00:34.260> think<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.800> matters<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
I don't think it really matters it

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.950 
I don't think it really matters it
doesn't<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.730> unperfect<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
doesn't have to be unperfect it can be

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.520 
doesn't have to be unperfect it can be
do<00:00:37.860> watch<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.340> thick<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.760> thin<00:00:38.790> or<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> know

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
do watch how thick or thin or you know

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.200 
do watch how thick or thin or you know
like<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.940> thick

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
like if you do a really really thick

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
like if you do a really really thick
versus<00:00:42.629> something<00:00:42.989> thin<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.500> work

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
versus something thin it will work

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.600 
versus something thin it will work
differently<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.800> if

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
differently what we want to do is see if

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
differently what we want to do is see if
when<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.390> even<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.050> you're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
when you put it on even when you're

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
when you put it on even when you're
doing<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> wall<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.730> easily<00:00:50.969> be

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
doing it on the wall this can easily be

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
doing it on the wall this can easily be
the<00:00:51.449> case<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.530> let's<00:00:52.770> say<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.129> your

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the case you can let's say you get your

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400 
the case you can let's say you get your
glaze<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.420> put<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.660> plastic<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
glaze on you put your plastic on and you

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
glaze on you put your plastic on and you
remove<00:00:55.649> too<00:00:55.829> much<00:00:55.860> well<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:56.910> start<00:00:57.239> over

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
remove too much well then start over

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180 
remove too much well then start over
just<00:00:57.750> put<00:00:57.930> some<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.260> glaze<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
just put some more glaze on and do it

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.619 
just put some more glaze on and do it
again<00:00:59.660> what<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.410> pull<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
again what you want to do is pull off a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
again what you want to do is pull off a
controllable<00:01:03.629> piece<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.140> plastic<00:01:05.150> saran<00:01:06.150> wrap

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
controllable piece of plastic saran wrap

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.190 
controllable piece of plastic saran wrap
because<00:01:06.540> otherwise<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.229> gets<00:01:07.350> too<00:01:07.500> unruly<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
because otherwise it gets too unruly and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.480 
because otherwise it gets too unruly and
then<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.350> gonna<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
then you're gonna actually just put it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
then you're gonna actually just put it
down<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> surface<00:01:12.290> what<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.409> gonna

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
down on the surface what you're gonna

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
down on the surface what you're gonna
just<00:01:13.710> smoosh<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.250> up<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.670> bit<00:01:15.080> kind<00:01:16.080> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
just smoosh it up a little bit kind of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
just smoosh it up a little bit kind of
smooth<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.430> take<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
smooth it out and if I take this off and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.830 
smooth it out and if I take this off and
it's<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.390> gone

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's all gone

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
it's all gone
no<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.909> more

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
no it's not you can see how you get more

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
no it's not you can see how you get more
of<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:21.990> organic<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> look

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
of a kind of an organic you kind of look

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.899 
of a kind of an organic you kind of look
to<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.420> let's<00:01:24.840> try<00:01:25.259> again<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.340> can't<00:01:26.580> use

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
to it now let's try again you can't use

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
to it now let's try again you can't use
the<00:01:27.150> plastic<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.500> over<00:01:28.770> again<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.220> least

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the plastic over and over again at least

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
the plastic over and over again at least
not<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.600> technique<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
not this for this technique because it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
not this for this technique because it
especially<00:01:31.920> saran<00:01:32.400> wrap<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.759> sort<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
especially saran wrap it sort of it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
especially saran wrap it sort of it
clings<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> itself<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.950> what<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
clings to itself which is what it's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
clings to itself which is what it's
supposed<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:37.640> anyway<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:40.049> try<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.710> go

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
supposed to do but anyway you try you go

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
supposed to do but anyway you try you go
do<00:01:41.220> your<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.549> section<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.540> again

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
do your one section then go on and again

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.050 
do your one section then go on and again
you<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.430> actually<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.610> shouldn't<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:44.939> do

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you don't actually I shouldn't even do

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.830 
you don't actually I shouldn't even do
this<00:01:45.180> don't<00:01:45.960> make<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.590> perfect<00:01:47.840> putting

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
this don't make it look perfect putting

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.810 
this don't make it look perfect putting
straight<00:01:49.350> lines<00:01:49.619> down<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> go<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.579> one

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
straight lines down when you go from one

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
straight lines down when you go from one
section<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.899> next<00:01:51.930> section<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> next

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
section to the next section in the next

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
section to the next section in the next
section<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> wall<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.820> create<00:01:54.240> sometimes

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
section on the wall can create sometimes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.100 
section on the wall can create sometimes
lines<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.540> doesn't<00:01:57.810> always<00:01:57.899> look

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
lines and then that doesn't always look

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
lines and then that doesn't always look
so<00:01:58.350> great<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.880> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> try<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so great so you want to try to make it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.679 
so great so you want to try to make it
look<00:02:01.219> what<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.280> call<00:02:02.689> inconsistently

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
look what I call inconsistently

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.590 
look what I call inconsistently
consistent<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.280> anyway<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
consistent so anyway then you go to the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.860 
consistent so anyway then you go to the
next<00:02:06.899> section<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:08.190> lay<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> out<00:02:10.760> again<00:02:11.870> smash

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
next section you lay it out again smash

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.760 
next section you lay it out again smash
it<00:02:13.050> up

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it up

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040 
it up
however<00:02:14.040> much<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.400> smash<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.880> will<00:02:15.060> determine

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
however much you smash it will determine

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
however much you smash it will determine
the<00:02:16.410> patterning<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.370> actually<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.300> created

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the patterning that actually is created

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.730 
the patterning that actually is created
rip<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> off<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.960> can<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> got<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
rip it off now you can see I got that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.260 
rip it off now you can see I got that
one<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> little<00:02:23.250> lighter<00:02:23.460> than<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.880> other<00:02:23.910> one

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
one a little lighter than the other one

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.660 
one a little lighter than the other one
now<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.930> am<00:02:25.140> gonna<00:02:25.290> show<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.890> she<00:02:26.130> cheats

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
now I am gonna show you what she cheats

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
now I am gonna show you what she cheats
so<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:27.480> really<00:02:27.750> want<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.140> go

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
so if you don't really want to go

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.200 
so if you don't really want to go
through<00:02:28.800> all<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.070> your<00:02:29.340> plastic<00:02:29.790> too<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
through all of your plastic too much you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.260 
through all of your plastic too much you
can<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:31.230> slightly<00:02:31.550> dab<00:02:32.550> down<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> just

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
can just slightly dab down and you just

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.830 
can just slightly dab down and you just
broke<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.960> up<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.290> bit<00:02:35.510> now<00:02:36.510> I'm<00:02:36.660> going

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
broke it up a little bit now I'm going

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200 
broke it up a little bit now I'm going
to<00:02:36.930> show<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:37.590> other<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.940> more<00:02:39.180> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
to show you one other that is more of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.910 
to show you one other that is more of
the<00:02:39.300> saran<00:02:39.630> wrap<00:02:39.840> I'm<00:02:40.350> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> show<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the saran wrap I'm going to show you

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.420 
the saran wrap I'm going to show you
with<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.190> thicker<00:02:41.520> grade<00:02:41.910> plastic<00:02:43.430> I've

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
with a thicker grade plastic I've

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
with a thicker grade plastic I've
already<00:02:44.700> got<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.880> pre-cut<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.780> I'll

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
already got it pre-cut and then I'll

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.400 
already got it pre-cut and then I'll
show<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.140> later<00:02:46.380> how<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> cut<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.730> plastic

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
show you later how to cut the plastic

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.810 
show you later how to cut the plastic
this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.830> milliliter<00:02:51.590> plastic<00:02:52.820> drop

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
this is one milliliter plastic drop

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.140 
this is one milliliter plastic drop
cloth<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> anyway<00:02:55.770> depending<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.910> size

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
cloth so anyway depending on this size

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.460 
cloth so anyway depending on this size
and<00:02:57.420> actually<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.900> too<00:02:58.080> big<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.260> I'm

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and actually this is too big so I'm

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.450 
and actually this is too big so I'm
gonna<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.770> ahead<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.920> cut<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.160> right<00:02:59.340> now

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
gonna go ahead and cut it right now

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.450 
gonna go ahead and cut it right now
anyway<00:03:03.320> depending<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.440> what<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.190> this

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
anyway depending on what it is this

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.030 
anyway depending on what it is this
particular<00:03:06.150> plastic<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.780> nicer<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> don't

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
particular plastic is nicer I don't

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.610 
particular plastic is nicer I don't
particularly<00:03:08.520> like<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.090> seven<00:03:09.540> point<00:03:10.380> seven

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
particularly like the seven point seven

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.120 
particularly like the seven point seven
milliliter<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.940> too<00:03:12.330> too<00:03:12.900> thin<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:13.920> try

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
milliliter it's too too thin you can try

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.800 
milliliter it's too too thin you can try
it<00:03:14.190> with<00:03:14.280> different<00:03:14.550> kinds<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.300> plastic<00:03:15.690> cuz

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
it with different kinds of plastic cuz

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660 
it with different kinds of plastic cuz
it<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.110> creates<00:03:16.410> different<00:03:16.830> things<00:03:17.040> but

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
it just creates different things but

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.490 
it just creates different things but
here<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.150> already<00:03:18.360> see<00:03:18.690> how<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.110> makes<00:03:19.260> a

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
here you can already see how it makes a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
here you can already see how it makes a
bigger<00:03:19.770> imprint<00:03:20.430> than<00:03:20.910> what<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.330> one<00:03:21.570> right

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
bigger imprint than what this one right

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.170 
bigger imprint than what this one right
next<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.260> does<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.490> kind<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.790> cool<00:03:24.000> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
next to it does so it's kind of cool to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.580 
next to it does so it's kind of cool to
know<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.020> that<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.440> there's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
know that you can do that and there's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.430 
know that you can do that and there's
also<00:03:26.010> one<00:03:26.459> other<00:03:26.490> cheat<00:03:27.080> so<00:03:28.080> let's<00:03:28.260> say<00:03:28.380> you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
also one other cheat so let's say you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.050 
also one other cheat so let's say you
see<00:03:28.680> all<00:03:28.860> these<00:03:28.980> lines<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.550> are<00:03:29.640> showing<00:03:29.940> in

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
see all these lines that are showing in

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.790 
see all these lines that are showing in
here<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.900> don't<00:03:31.080> particularly<00:03:31.470> like

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
here and you don't particularly like

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.130 
here and you don't particularly like
them<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.910> make<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.300> more<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.750> do<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
them you can make it more and do the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.720 
them you can make it more and do the
other<00:03:34.170> technique<00:03:35.070> which<00:03:35.220> I'm<00:03:35.340> going<00:03:35.490> to<00:03:35.550> show

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
other technique which I'm going to show

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.820 
other technique which I'm going to show
you<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.030> second<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.290> takes<00:03:37.530> off

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
you in a second and that just takes off

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.830 
you in a second and that just takes off
a<00:03:37.860> little<00:03:38.220> bit<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.670> then<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.180> makes<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.660> so

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
a little bit and then it makes it so

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.980 
a little bit and then it makes it so
that<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.230> don't<00:03:40.440> don't<00:03:41.190> see<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.610> issue<00:03:41.990> so

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
that you don't don't see that issue so

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.260 
that you don't don't see that issue so
that's<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> first<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.880> now<00:03:44.880> I'm<00:03:45.000> going<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
that's the first one now I'm going to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.980 
that's the first one now I'm going to
show<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:46.880> without<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.570> considered

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
show you without that is considered

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.990 
show you without that is considered
putting<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:49.770> of<00:03:49.830> flat<00:03:50.160> we're<00:03:50.850> going

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
putting it on kind of flat we're going

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.270 
putting it on kind of flat we're going
to<00:03:51.090> do<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.360> one<00:03:51.540> different<00:03:51.720> now<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.890> one<00:03:53.130> is

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
to do this one different now this one is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.840 
to do this one different now this one is
the<00:03:53.400> one<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.610> find<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.090> lot<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.390> people<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.110> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
the one I find a lot of people like and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.260 
the one I find a lot of people like and
it<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.030> very<00:03:57.240> successful<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.050> easy<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.590> do<00:03:59.270> so

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
it is very successful and easy to do so

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.650 
it is very successful and easy to do so
again<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.660> put<00:04:00.840> your<00:04:00.990> glaze<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:02.100> same<00:04:02.880> way<00:04:05.660> and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
again you put your glaze on same way and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.090 
again you put your glaze on same way and
then<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.900> take<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.320> plastic<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.890> one

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
then you take your plastic and this one

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.330 
then you take your plastic and this one
actually<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.490> pretty<00:04:08.940> decent<00:04:09.360> size<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
actually is pretty decent size I

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.710 
actually is pretty decent size I
actually<00:04:11.340> recommend<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:12.209> like<00:04:12.330> doing<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
actually recommend for like doing the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.280 
actually recommend for like doing the
sample<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.440> okay<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:15.360> have<00:04:15.510> bare<00:04:15.750> hands<00:04:15.989> but

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
sample it's okay to have bare hands but

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.199 
sample it's okay to have bare hands but
I<00:04:16.320> recommend<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.220> actually<00:04:17.370> use<00:04:17.669> gloves

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
I recommend that you actually use gloves

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.590 
I recommend that you actually use gloves
I<00:04:18.630> use<00:04:19.470> latex<00:04:19.950> gloves<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.390> gets

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
I use latex gloves because this gets

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.880 
I use latex gloves because this gets
really<00:04:21.900> messy<00:04:22.049> after<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.560> while<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.800> your

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
really messy after a while and your

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.130 
really messy after a while and your
hands<00:04:23.070> just<00:04:23.280> gonna<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:23.580> all<00:04:23.790> gooey<00:04:24.140> but

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
hands just gonna be like all gooey but

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.290 
hands just gonna be like all gooey but
anyway<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.680> just

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
anyway this is just

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.779 
anyway this is just
a<00:04:26.389> dab<00:04:27.050> method<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:30.190> mean<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.310> will<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.460> to

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
a dab method I mean you will have to

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.960 
a dab method I mean you will have to
twist<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.330> turn<00:04:32.539> it<00:04:34.479> and<00:04:35.479> you<00:04:36.759> are<00:04:37.759> always

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
twist and turn it and you are always

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.180 
twist and turn it and you are always
going<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.270> look<00:04:38.479> for<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.750> clean<00:04:39.050> section<00:04:39.409> on<00:04:39.979> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
going to look for a clean section on the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.879 
going to look for a clean section on the
plastic<00:04:40.900> because<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:41.930> will<00:04:42.169> get<00:04:42.319> dirty<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
plastic because it will get dirty and

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.670 
plastic because it will get dirty and
then<00:04:43.159> you<00:04:43.310> need<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:43.699> a<00:04:43.759> name<00:04:43.970> piece<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.680> also

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
then you need to get a name piece I also

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.279 
then you need to get a name piece I also
tend<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.129> cut<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.699> bunch<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.449> plastic<00:04:47.690> ahead<00:04:48.169> of

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
tend to cut a bunch of plastic ahead of

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.640 
tend to cut a bunch of plastic ahead of
time<00:04:49.360> because<00:04:50.360> it<00:04:50.870> just<00:04:50.930> makes<00:04:51.229> it<00:04:51.319> easier

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
time because it just makes it easier

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.809 
time because it just makes it easier
especially<00:04:52.069> when<00:04:52.159> you're<00:04:52.250> doing<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.460> wall<00:04:52.639> I

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
especially when you're doing a wall I

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.850 
especially when you're doing a wall I
recommend<00:04:53.419> you<00:04:53.690> do<00:04:53.870> enough<00:04:54.349> that<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.650> think

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
recommend you do enough that you think

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.409 
recommend you do enough that you think
you<00:04:54.949> can<00:04:55.099> cover<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.550> whole<00:04:55.729> wall<00:04:55.940> before<00:04:56.180> you

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
you can cover the whole wall before you

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.140 
you can cover the whole wall before you
actually<00:04:56.810> go<00:04:57.139> on<00:04:57.289> or<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.740> may<00:04:57.979> hate<00:04:58.789> yourself

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
actually go on or you may hate yourself

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.700 
actually go on or you may hate yourself
because<00:04:59.659> you'll<00:04:59.840> be<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.110> trying<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.440> cut<00:05:00.590> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
because you'll be like trying to cut the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.999 
because you'll be like trying to cut the
plastic<00:05:01.159> and<00:05:01.280> your<00:05:01.400> glaze<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:01.789> already<00:05:02.030> dry

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
plastic and your glaze is already dry

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.559 
plastic and your glaze is already dry
this<00:05:04.009> plastic<00:05:04.550> comes<00:05:04.759> just<00:05:05.210> from<00:05:05.360> any

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:05.569 
this plastic comes just from any

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.390 
this plastic comes just from any
hardware<00:05:05.780> store<00:05:05.990> it's<00:05:06.590> just<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.770> plastic<00:05:07.219> drop

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
hardware store it's just a plastic drop

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.670 
hardware store it's just a plastic drop
cloth<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:07.819> all<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.599> you<00:05:09.229> can<00:05:09.469> get

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
cloth that's all of this and you can get

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.499 
cloth that's all of this and you can get
the<00:05:09.830> really<00:05:10.039> super<00:05:10.430> thick<00:05:10.849> plastic<00:05:11.330> drop

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
the really super thick plastic drop

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:13.779 
the really super thick plastic drop
cloths<00:05:11.780> but<00:05:12.020> they<00:05:12.319> will<00:05:12.530> create<00:05:13.069> a<00:05:13.250> different

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
cloths but they will create a different

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.420 
cloths but they will create a different
more<00:05:13.969> bloppy<00:05:14.900> look<00:05:15.289> so<00:05:15.620> it<00:05:15.710> just<00:05:15.889> depends<00:05:16.250> on

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
more bloppy look so it just depends on

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.100 
more bloppy look so it just depends on
what<00:05:16.580> kind<00:05:16.789> of<00:05:16.879> look<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.240> don't<00:05:17.539> recommend

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
what kind of look I don't recommend

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.409 
what kind of look I don't recommend
saran<00:05:18.830> wrap<00:05:19.069> for<00:05:19.280> this<00:05:19.490> because<00:05:19.759> it's<00:05:20.090> too

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
saran wrap for this because it's too

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.749 
saran wrap for this because it's too
thin<00:05:20.690> it'll<00:05:21.379> all<00:05:21.560> bowl<00:05:21.800> up<00:05:21.949> together<00:05:22.129> and<00:05:22.580> then

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
thin it'll all bowl up together and then

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.240 
thin it'll all bowl up together and then
you<00:05:22.879> won't<00:05:23.090> have<00:05:23.199> that<00:05:24.199> kind<00:05:24.469> of<00:05:24.560> look<00:05:24.740> so

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
you won't have that kind of look so

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.809 
you won't have that kind of look so
that's<00:05:25.699> basically<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.599> entire<00:05:27.349> look<00:05:27.819> here's

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
that's basically the entire look here's

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:30.730 
that's basically the entire look here's
some<00:05:29.419> of<00:05:29.509> the<00:05:29.599> other<00:05:29.629> colors<00:05:30.169> one<00:05:30.529> of<00:05:30.650> the

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
some of the other colors one of the

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.110 
some of the other colors one of the
things<00:05:30.889> I<00:05:31.039> want<00:05:31.219> to<00:05:31.279> show<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.580> is<00:05:31.759> when<00:05:31.909> it's<00:05:32.029> a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
things I want to show you is when it's a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.209 
things I want to show you is when it's a
really<00:05:32.300> dark<00:05:32.599> color<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:33.139> can<00:05:33.650> put<00:05:33.889> a<00:05:33.919> finish

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
really dark color you can put a finish

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.219 
really dark color you can put a finish
coat<00:05:34.580> over<00:05:34.789> it's<00:05:34.969> just<00:05:35.210> clear<00:05:35.599> urethane

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
coat over it's just clear urethane

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.260 
coat over it's just clear urethane
water-based<00:05:36.830> your<00:05:37.099> thing<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.909> actually

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
water-based your thing that actually

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.089 
water-based your thing that actually
brings<00:05:38.479> out<00:05:38.659> the<00:05:38.840> depth<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.440> color<00:05:39.650> so

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
brings out the depth of the color so

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.240 
brings out the depth of the color so
depending<00:05:40.639> on<00:05:41.409> this<00:05:42.409> you<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.919> leave<00:05:43.099> it

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
depending on this you can leave it

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.070 
depending on this you can leave it
without<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.729> finish<00:05:44.000> but<00:05:44.509> it<00:05:44.599> just<00:05:44.779> gets<00:05:44.930> a

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
without the finish but it just gets a

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.170 
without the finish but it just gets a
little<00:05:45.199> richer<00:05:45.650> if<00:05:45.830> you<00:05:46.009> don't<00:05:46.279> and<00:05:46.580> then<00:05:47.060> you

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
little richer if you don't and then you

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.990 
little richer if you don't and then you
can<00:05:47.300> have<00:05:47.449> lighter<00:05:47.690> colors<00:05:48.050> darker<00:05:48.500> colors<00:05:49.000> or

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
can have lighter colors darker colors or

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.499 
can have lighter colors darker colors or
you<00:05:50.479> can<00:05:50.690> do<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.259> finish<00:05:51.590> on<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.940> walls<00:05:53.150> and

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
you can do the finish on the walls and

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.379 
you can do the finish on the walls and
stray<00:05:54.319> your<00:05:54.949> trim<00:05:55.250> which<00:05:55.909> you've<00:05:56.240> already

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
stray your trim which you've already

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.689 
stray your trim which you've already
learned<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.800> let<00:05:58.039> me<00:05:58.159> show<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.430> really

learned and let me show you really
quickly<00:05:59.029> when<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.930> get<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.289> drop<00:06:00.560> cloth<00:06:01.120> you

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
quickly when you get the drop cloth you

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.269 
quickly when you get the drop cloth you
know<00:06:02.240> this<00:06:02.419> one's<00:06:02.629> been<00:06:02.779> cut<00:06:03.020> somewhat<00:06:03.560> but

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
know this one's been cut somewhat but

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.959 
know this one's been cut somewhat but
all<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.240> want<00:06:05.419> to<00:06:05.539> do<00:06:05.690> is<00:06:05.930> just<00:06:06.229> take<00:06:06.590> a

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
all you want to do is just take a

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.469 
all you want to do is just take a
certain<00:06:08.199> distance<00:06:09.199> and<00:06:09.409> just<00:06:09.590> cut<00:06:10.479> that's

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
certain distance and just cut that's

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.019 
certain distance and just cut that's
usually<00:06:12.020> more<00:06:12.440> than<00:06:12.500> enough<00:06:12.949> for<00:06:13.400> each<00:06:13.610> size

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:14.029 
usually more than enough for each size

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.869 
usually more than enough for each size
don't<00:06:14.509> go<00:06:14.690> too<00:06:14.960> small<00:06:15.319> or<00:06:15.620> it<00:06:15.770> becomes<00:06:16.310> a

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:16.879 
don't go too small or it becomes a

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.209 
don't go too small or it becomes a
nuisance<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.379> your<00:06:18.590> you<00:06:18.800> know<00:06:18.830> if<00:06:18.979> you<00:06:19.069> go

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
nuisance and your you know if you go

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:22.100
