00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 understood 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 and from 80 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.820
 the skype entertainment company to 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.440
 people always face this challenge of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.910

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.110
 campaigns that are also 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.570
 entertainment the idea is people 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.430
 continue with the strategy that the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.460
 a few years ago to put together a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.620
 campaign as several episodes then the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.300
 movies are counting over time 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 one time history was 0 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 playing a role that is not the role 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.300
 traditional model but always with a 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.040
 subscriber of sky 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.730
 one of the main products that TV by 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.130
 signature band is is cinema is the magic of 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.660
 cinema and the magic of entertainment and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.300
 which is cool the following you see that the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.160
 sky communication we mess with the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.790
 people's feelings with the emotion of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.149
 people 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.950
 the good humor with this relationship and not a 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.880
 part of the pocket to commercial part by 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.110
 that's what we chose the 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.390
 entertainment this thing 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.729
 as the focus of communication 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.770
 of the song several scripts 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.680
 this first script is really what 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.320
 Greater use the film that launches 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.950
 terror concept has no sky terror and no 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.700
 fishing in a house is where people 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 They are so discouraged this is 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 the house before you even arrive after 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 they're already there, she turns into a very 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.159
 more cool my characters that enter the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.930
 horror character now space faith is 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.450
 a much more fun character 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 also that there are already sputum that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 dead letter né 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.649
 is that hook of terror is 12 much 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.890
 It's cool, it's okay, both the kids. 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.140
 as teenagers as use with 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.840
 adults is a theme yes part portuguese 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.390
 has been grabbed some from now on 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.759
 Twilight is a theme that is there 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 and that is very cinematic is very 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.360
 nice offensive this field with us to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.399
 possibility to use the music thriller 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 of michael jackson that gives a face 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.680
 different from the movie draws a lot of attention 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.480
 a perfect movie as almost as if 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.870
 the song was a character in the movie 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 also 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.660
 we never used as top gisele 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.640
 model and we always put gisele as 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.310
 a character I think the highest point 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.750
 including benchmark reference within 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.420
 skype itself was the campaign I 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.760
 I came back and there's Gisele a housewife. 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.680
 waiting for the return of her husband and 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.230
 where she placed gisele in several 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.170
 She was already Maria Antonieta. 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.180
 it was already a series of characters she was 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.820
 It's a lot of fun, we shoot. It falls for me. 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.650
 always a lot of fun, I love doing 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.750
 adoring to make the vampire here she is a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.610
 franchise star but she knows she's a 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.750
 vampire we can forget that 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.250
 She 's got a sinister side. 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.860
 also extends that raising the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.440
 skynet we knew that this campaign 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.480
 would have some difficulty that José 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.520
 She was pregnant she is one month of a 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.470
 baby and we put it good let's go 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.630
 do that campaign then in the states 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.730
 united once in the united states a 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.800
 ideal place for los angeles where you 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.020
 film eyes the possibility of having 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.240
 access to the world of film industry 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.220
 biggest industry of the big cinema the people 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.840
 was able to find her professionals who 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.660
 had competence for that business of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340
 make ghost do makeup 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.959
 hunchback is so accustomed to doing 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.910
 these classic characters that the guy 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.150
 has no previous preparation then it is 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.910
 for example Franco in is the head 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.350
 the head of this size does not 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.150
 I really liked to appear a little smaller 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.280
 Easy door to enter inside 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.140
 dressing room for the good of his truck 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.140
 turn a smaller head in half an hour 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:01.099
 there is already a great challenge that people 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.590
 always ask for giovani it's us 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.599
 able to use all the Quechua and 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.280
 sponsored athletes that the company comes 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.830
 supporting these years has taken 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.840
 and changed it from paper 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.450
 bernardinho he is the blog some na 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.600
 history took vitor belfort turned 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.280
 in a franchise we got 10 and 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.389
 Turned out she 's a vampire. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.240
 When you put them they come from a 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.740
 character is another thing to work on 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.050
 because these guys really dress 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.120
 of a cheap there that is not much it 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.669
 You know they like that, I think that everything. 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.860
 world the bernardo jota quest o vitor 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.010
 Belfort and Gisele herself were very 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.720
 do because it is was very very good 17 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.760
 humorous and I think the final product 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.080
 It is very nice and I enjoyed 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.760
 I hope people have also 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.770
 fun to accompany this expensive campaign 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 what will be the next to cases not 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 invented the concept of a stack in 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.410
 next expectation that I know 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.530
 will see one thing even more street 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.400
 I hope you enjoy this commercial 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.410
 as much as I'm thinking of doing 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.410
 so a kiss on 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.920
 I like myself 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:28.140
 that's just it 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.890
 the hotel 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:48.480
 the street bench you do not have will fall from 4 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.690
 one thousand four years and 11 compare change is already 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.960
 very comprehensive sky that this dead letter 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.960
