00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.059 
through in like 20-25 minutes of a sort
of<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:26.080> doing<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.650> guess<00:02:26.830> somehow

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
of what I was doing but I guess somehow

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.540 
of what I was doing but I guess somehow
better<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:28.660> they<00:02:29.470> they're<00:02:29.920> really

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
better because they they're really

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.930 
better because they they're really
really<00:02:30.790> hard<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.269> handle<00:02:31.920> ok<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.489> that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
really hard to handle ok so that's that

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.740 
really hard to handle ok so that's that
um<00:02:35.700> sometimes<00:02:36.700> also<00:02:36.880> throw<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.300> colleague

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
um sometimes also throw that colleague

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.380 
um sometimes also throw that colleague
or<00:02:37.930> two<00:02:38.140> as<00:02:38.319> they're<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.650> along<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:39.390> if

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
or two as they're going along like if

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.670 
or two as they're going along like if
they<00:02:40.510> terraform<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.110> destroy<00:02:41.350> one<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
they terraform and destroy one of the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640 
they terraform and destroy one of the
enemy<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.040> though<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.989> drop<00:02:43.989> down<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.200> colony

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
enemy is though to drop down a colony

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.910 
enemy is though to drop down a colony
and<00:02:44.800> buy<00:02:44.980> another<00:02:45.100> colony<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:46.230> repair<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.500> all

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
and buy another colony in repair and all

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.160 
and buy another colony in repair and all
that<00:02:48.130> stuff<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:49.540> I'll<00:02:49.660> have<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> way<00:02:49.989> back

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
that stuff and then I'll have a way back

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.780 
that stuff and then I'll have a way back
that's<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.530> little<00:02:50.709> easier<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.400> can't<00:02:51.700> help

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
that's a little easier but I can't help

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.309 
that's a little easier but I can't help
but<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.209> rocks<00:02:52.870> i'll<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.140> go<00:02:53.260> over

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
but think that rocks i'll just go over

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.020 
but think that rocks i'll just go over
there<00:02:53.470> slaughter<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:54.010> unless<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.910> all

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
there slaughter it unless you it all

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.970 
there slaughter it unless you it all
maxed<00:02:55.420> out<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.690> even<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.799> gonna

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
maxed out and even then it's gonna

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.830 
maxed out and even then it's gonna
connect<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.549> lot<00:02:57.670> more<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.329> my<00:02:58.480> theory<00:02:58.720> i

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
connect a lot more this is my theory i

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.160 
connect a lot more this is my theory i
don't<00:02:59.079> know<00:02:59.200> i<00:02:59.380> could<00:02:59.620> be<00:02:59.680> toeing<00:02:59.860> around<00:03:01.170> it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
don't know i could be toeing around it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.199 
don't know i could be toeing around it
says<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.860> that's<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> only<00:03:03.640> one<00:03:03.820> from<00:03:04.000> paper

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
says it that's the only one from paper

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.890 
says it that's the only one from paper
actually<00:03:04.450> if<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.170> Davers<00:03:06.900> empire

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
actually if you look at Davers empire

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500 
actually if you look at Davers empire
it's<00:03:08.230> pretty<00:03:08.500> hefty<00:03:09.070> okay<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:09.730> like<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.480> was

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it's pretty hefty okay so like I was

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.770 
it's pretty hefty okay so like I was
saying<00:03:10.600> got<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.260> 10<00:03:11.880> pierce<00:03:12.880> through<00:03:13.180> found

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
saying got to 10 pierce through found

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.890 
saying got to 10 pierce through found
