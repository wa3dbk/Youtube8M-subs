important<00:01:40.710> reasons<00:01:41.130> why<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.579> use<00:01:41.610> seafoam

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
important reasons why we use seafoam

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
important reasons why we use seafoam
when<00:01:43.079> added<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> fuel<00:01:43.860> seafoam<00:01:44.460> helps<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
when added to fuel seafoam helps to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
when added to fuel seafoam helps to
preserve<00:01:45.299> ignition<00:01:46.049> vapors<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> stabilize
