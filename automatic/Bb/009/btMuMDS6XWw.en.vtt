this<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.350> my<00:02:45.769> husband<00:02:46.250> secret<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.850> use<00:02:47.030> two

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
this is my husband secret to use two

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.070 
this is my husband secret to use two
small<00:02:48.380> pans<00:02:49.069> instead<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.060> one<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.049> you

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
small pans instead of one so that you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.259 
small pans instead of one so that you
can<00:02:51.410> make<00:02:51.590> pancakes<00:02:51.980> faster<00:02:52.790> because<00:02:53.120> usually

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
can make pancakes faster because usually

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.110 
can make pancakes faster because usually
when<00:02:53.690> Luca<00:02:54.080> wants<00:02:54.410> pancakes<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:55.160> right<00:02:55.940> now

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it's I want pancakes now so it is way

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.199 
it's I want pancakes now so it is way
it's<00:03:02.390> easier<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.959> faster<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.190> turn<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it's easier and faster so we turn on the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.830 
it's easier and faster so we turn on the
heat<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:07.310> other<00:03:07.430> secret<00:03:08.090> or<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.360> other

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
heat and the other secret or the other

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.740 
heat and the other secret or the other
reality<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:10.010> usually<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.850> first<00:03:11.450> two

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
reality is that usually the first two

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.560 
reality is that usually the first two
pancakes<00:03:12.290> they<00:03:12.920> go<00:03:13.489> wrong<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.030> mean<00:03:14.150> they're

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
pancakes they go wrong I mean they're

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.110 
pancakes they go wrong I mean they're
never<00:03:14.840> perfect<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.769> as<00:03:16.100> we<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.430> dogs<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.000> the

the<00:03:36.889> level<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.400> right<00:03:37.579> level<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.180> flame<00:03:38.600> that

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
the level the right level of flame that

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.569 
the level the right level of flame that
it's<00:03:39.139> perfect<00:03:39.620> for<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.889> pancakes<00:03:40.370> it's

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
it's perfect for the pancakes it's

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.539 
it's perfect for the pancakes it's
between<00:03:41.000> low<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.660> medium<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.739> got<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:43.100> do<00:03:43.190> not

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
between low and medium we got I do not

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.629 
between low and medium we got I do not
use<00:03:43.819> any<00:03:44.120> oil<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.200> butter<00:03:45.530> nothing<00:03:46.250> because

the<00:03:46.940> coconut<00:03:47.150> oil<00:03:47.480> will<00:03:48.019> be<00:03:48.170> enough<00:03:48.560> for<00:03:48.859> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
the coconut oil will be enough for the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.680 
the coconut oil will be enough for the
pancakes<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.730> move<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.269> pan

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
pancakes to move in the pan

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.319 
pancakes to move in the pan
I<00:03:50.720> will<00:03:51.049> use<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.380> small<00:03:51.620> ladle<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.730> measuring

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
I will use a small ladle as a measuring

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.870 
I will use a small ladle as a measuring
cup<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.109> will<00:03:54.290> make<00:03:54.500> with<00:03:54.739> each<00:03:54.920> ladle<00:03:55.519> one

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
cup and I will make with each ladle one
pancake<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.440> let's<00:03:57.799> start<00:03:58.100> together

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
pancake so let's start together

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.160 
pancake so let's start together
spread<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.350> pancake<00:04:00.859> mix<00:04:01.870> giving<00:04:02.870> our

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
spread the pancake mix giving our

pancakes and nice and round shape and
then<00:04:07.220> wait<00:04:07.850> up<00:04:08.329> until<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.319> first<00:04:09.709> bubble<00:04:10.549> will

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
then wait up until the first bubble will

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.140 
then wait up until the first bubble will
come<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.840> order<00:04:12.170> to

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
come in order to

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.880 
come in order to
like<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.450> pancake<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.079> will<00:04:14.260> take<00:04:14.439> one<00:04:14.709> minute

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
like the pancake it will take one minute

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.009 
like the pancake it will take one minute
one<00:04:15.370> minute<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.879> a<00:04:15.939> half<00:04:16.090> nothing<00:04:16.780> more

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
one minute and a half nothing more

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.710 
one minute and a half nothing more
that's<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.799> time<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.400> start<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.030> second<00:04:19.479> one

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.230 
that's the time to start the second one
and<00:04:19.989> then<00:04:20.259> we'll<00:04:20.590> keep<00:04:20.829> going<00:04:21.160> because<00:04:21.910> when

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
and then we'll keep going because when

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.390 
and then we'll keep going because when
the<00:04:22.419> first<00:04:22.660> one<00:04:22.900> will<00:04:23.110> be<00:04:23.139> ready<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:24.100> will<00:04:24.280> be

the first one will be ready it will be
time<00:04:24.699> to<00:04:24.940> flip<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.330> second<00:04:25.690> one<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.199> can

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
time to flip the second one and you can

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.100 
time to flip the second one and you can
prepare<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.740> third<00:04:26.919> one<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.300> on<00:04:28.509> so<00:04:29.080> I

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
prepare the third one and and so on so I
