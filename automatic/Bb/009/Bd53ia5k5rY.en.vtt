00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
but i think you know i can try to set up

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.990 
but i think you know i can try to set up
on<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.720> or<00:02:49.110> stall<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.830> out<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.490> now<00:02:50.700> he's<00:02:50.880> going

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
on it or stall it out but now he's going

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.970 
on it or stall it out but now he's going

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
to go out to his agron and I'm guessing

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.770 
to go out to his agron and I'm guessing
this<00:02:53.070> thing<00:02:53.220> as<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> sturdy<00:02:53.730> agron<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.360> metal

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
this thing as a sturdy agron with metal

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.890 
this thing as a sturdy agron with metal
burst<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:56.070> I'm<00:02:56.400> gonna<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.390> rid<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.660> sturdy

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
burst so I'm gonna get rid of a sturdy

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.450 
burst so I'm gonna get rid of a sturdy
at<00:02:58.080> least<00:02:58.230> try<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.680> rid<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.860> sturdy<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.280> he

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
at least try to get rid of sturdy and he

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.800 
at least try to get rid of sturdy and he
predicts<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.910> leech<00:03:00.150> seed<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.540> he's<00:03:00.660> not

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
predicts that leech seed so he's not

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
pretty sure a seed flare at this point

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.020 
pretty sure a seed flare at this point
of<00:03:16.110> HP<00:03:16.470> won't<00:03:16.800> kill<00:03:17.010> him<00:03:17.130> off<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.760> I'm<00:03:17.940> gonna

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
of HP won't kill him off so I'm gonna

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.760 
of HP won't kill him off so I'm gonna

with<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.070> leech<00:03:20.640> seeds<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.450> get<00:03:21.660> him<00:03:21.750> down<00:03:21.900> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
with the leech seeds to get him down to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.360 
with the leech seeds to get him down to
low<00:03:22.230> enough<00:03:22.380> HP<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:22.890> me<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.070> kill<00:03:23.220> him<00:03:23.250> off

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
low enough HP for me to kill him off

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
low enough HP for me to kill him off
with<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.550> flare<00:03:23.940> which<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.140> what<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> do

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
with a flare which is that what I do

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.900 
with a flare which is that what I do
because<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.770> don't<00:03:26.070> want<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.370> risk<00:03:26.490> my<00:03:26.700> shame

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
and dying with a metal brace so I'm

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.630 
and dying with a metal brace so I'm
pretty<00:03:28.500> sure<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.740> seed<00:03:29.010> flare<00:03:29.160> would<00:03:29.310> come<00:03:29.490> off

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
pretty sure a seed flare would come off

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.570
