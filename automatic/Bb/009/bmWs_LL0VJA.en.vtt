in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.410> how-to<00:00:01.620> video<00:00:01.920> I'm<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.550> show

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this how-to video I'm going to show

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.309 
in this how-to video I'm going to show
how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.319> replicate<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:05.150> create<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.569> secondary

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
how to replicate and create a secondary

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.360 
how to replicate and create a secondary
DNS<00:00:07.919> zone<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.760> Windows<00:00:09.210> 2008<00:00:09.809> dns<00:00:10.230> manager<00:00:10.410> so

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
DNS zone in Windows 2008 dns manager so

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.280 
DNS zone in Windows 2008 dns manager so
first<00:00:11.759> we'll<00:00:11.880> open<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> dns<00:00:12.690> manager<00:00:12.900> by

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
first we'll open up the dns manager by

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
first we'll open up the dns manager by
going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.590> start<00:00:13.889> administrative<00:00:14.549> tools<00:00:14.790> and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
going to start administrative tools and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.730 
going to start administrative tools and
then<00:00:15.900> dns<00:00:16.470> from<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:18.090> two<00:00:18.420> different

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
then dns from here we see two different

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.349 
then dns from here we see two different
domain<00:00:19.740> controllers<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.609> dns<00:00:20.970> servers

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
domain controllers that have dns servers

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.990 
domain controllers that have dns servers
that<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> dns<00:00:22.830> manager<00:00:23.010> will<00:00:23.519> expand

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that are in the dns manager will expand

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.790 
that are in the dns manager will expand
the<00:00:24.269> forward<00:00:24.570> lookup<00:00:24.779> zones<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.260> both<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.650> them

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the forward lookup zones of both of them

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000 
the forward lookup zones of both of them
here<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.910> test<00:00:27.269> dot<00:00:27.510> local<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.859> we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
here we have test dot local and here we

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
here we have test dot local and here we
do<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.939> we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.420> test<00:00:30.720> dot

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
do not so we're going to make test dot

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.180 
do not so we're going to make test dot
local<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.439> secondary<00:00:32.070> DNS<00:00:32.669> zone<00:00:33.290> inside<00:00:34.290> d<00:00:34.710> co<00:00:34.980> 2

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
local a secondary DNS zone inside d co 2

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
local a secondary DNS zone inside d co 2
so<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.450> allow<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so first we have to allow the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
so first we have to allow the
replication<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.610> click<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.000> choose

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
replication so we right click and choose

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.729 
replication so we right click and choose
properties<00:00:39.710> we<00:00:40.710> choose<00:00:41.040> zone<00:00:41.610> transfers<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
properties we choose zone transfers and

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
properties we choose zone transfers and
from<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.219> choose<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.180> zone

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
from here we can choose the zone

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
from here we can choose the zone
transfers<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.320> server<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:47.129> zones

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
transfers to any server only zones

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
transfers to any server only zones
listed<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.840> name<00:00:49.110> servers<00:00:49.500> tab<00:00:49.800> or

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
listed on the the name servers tab or

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.209 
listed on the the name servers tab or
only<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> following<00:00:51.449> server<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:53.010> most

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
only to the following server so the most

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.270 
only to the following server so the most
secure<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.739> use<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> these

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
secure way would be to use one of these

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.209 
secure way would be to use one of these
two<00:00:57.180> options<00:00:57.809> where<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.440> edit<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> add<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
two options where we can edit and add a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.760 
two options where we can edit and add a
server<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.879> we'll<00:01:00.000> go<00:01:00.120> ahead<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
server so we'll go ahead and do that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
server so we'll go ahead and do that
from<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.520> type<00:01:02.820> DC<00:01:03.539> 0<00:01:03.840> 2<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
from here we will type DC 0 2 which is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.390 
from here we will type DC 0 2 which is
our<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.460> server<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:07.560> server<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
our other server and that server is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.600 
our other server and that server is
there<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.090> we'll<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.330> ahead<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.510> click<00:01:09.689> OK<00:01:10.610> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
there so we'll go ahead and click OK it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.990 
there so we'll go ahead and click OK it
also<00:01:11.760> shows<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.659> IP<00:01:13.530> 6<00:01:14.070> version<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.670> well<00:01:14.700> but

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
also shows the IP 6 version as well but

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
also shows the IP 6 version as well but
we<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> worry<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.159> so

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
we don't have to worry about that so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.060 
we don't have to worry about that so
we'll<00:01:17.310> click<00:01:17.610> apply<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.799> go<00:01:19.920> down

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
we'll click apply and that will go down

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
we'll click apply and that will go down
to<00:01:20.250> DC<00:01:20.430> 0<00:01:20.640> 2<00:01:20.759> we'll<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.720> forward<00:01:22.200> lookup

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
to DC 0 2 we'll go to the forward lookup

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.580 
to DC 0 2 we'll go to the forward lookup
zone<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:22.950> choose<00:01:23.280> new<00:01:23.790> zone<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.590> we'll

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
zone will choose new zone and we'll

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.929 
zone will choose new zone and we'll
choose<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.220> secondary<00:01:26.880> zone<00:01:27.270> choose<00:01:27.990> next

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
choose a secondary zone choose next

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
choose a secondary zone choose next
secondary<00:01:29.939> zone<00:01:30.270> name<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
secondary zone name is going to be the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630 
secondary zone name is going to be the
same<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.530> DC<00:01:35.009> 01

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
same as it is in DC 01

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.310 
same as it is in DC 01
here<00:01:37.420> we<00:01:37.600> will<00:01:37.750> type<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.320> name<00:01:39.330> DC<00:01:40.330> 01<00:01:40.870> so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
here we will type in the name DC 01 so

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.090 
here we will type in the name DC 01 so
it<00:01:41.440> knows<00:01:41.620> where<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.920> replicate<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.500> choose

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
it knows where to replicate and choose

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.380 
it knows where to replicate and choose
next<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.790> then<00:01:46.479> finish<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:48.220> from<00:01:48.640> here<00:01:48.700> we

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
next and then finish now from here we

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.320 
next and then finish now from here we
can<00:01:49.570> see<00:01:49.840> that<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.580> zone<00:01:51.580> has<00:01:51.790> immediately

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
can see that the zone has immediately

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.380 
can see that the zone has immediately
replicated<00:01:52.960> with<00:01:53.229> our<00:01:53.560> test<00:01:54.490> dot<00:01:54.700> local<00:01:54.729> right

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
replicated with our test dot local right

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.390 
replicated with our test dot local right
there<00:01:55.660> if<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.350> replication<00:01:56.860> does<00:01:56.979> not<00:01:57.160> work

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
there if the replication does not work

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.650 
there if the replication does not work
then<00:01:57.940> right<00:01:58.180> here<00:01:58.210> there'll<00:01:58.600> be<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.960> red<00:01:59.320> X
