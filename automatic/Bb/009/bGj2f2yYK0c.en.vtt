00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
that's pretty good now we don't want to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.710 
that's pretty good now we don't want to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.850 

it's<00:00:45.720> pretty<00:00:46.470> good<00:00:47.990> I<00:00:50.840> mean<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.020> listen

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860

water<00:00:53.100> coming<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.520> here

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.620 

but<00:01:01.880> here<00:01:02.480> I'll<00:01:02.720> take<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:02.900> picture<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.650> mark

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
but here I'll take a picture of a mark

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:19.490 
but here I'll take a picture of a mark
he's<00:01:05.630> there<00:01:05.900> in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.080> rain<00:01:09.550> exposed

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.980 

it's<00:01:20.500> getting<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.920> little<00:01:21.010> fuzzy<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.630> it'd

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
it's getting a little fuzzy because it'd

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's getting a little fuzzy because it'd
be<00:01:23.140> well<00:01:23.350> there's<00:01:23.740> water<00:01:23.980> in<00:01:24.400> there<00:01:25.090> so<00:01:25.540> this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
be well there's water in there so this

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.930 
be well there's water in there so this
is<00:01:26.410> something<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.920> had<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.100> do<00:01:27.400> when<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.580> was<00:01:27.730> out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
is something I had to do when I was out

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.670 
is something I had to do when I was out
which<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.110> that<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:30.220> cleanest<00:01:30.670> constantly

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
which is that the cleanest constantly

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.110 
which is that the cleanest constantly
having<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.770> lens<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.160> probably<00:01:33.760> help<00:01:33.910> a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
having the lens would probably help a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.719 
having the lens would probably help a
little<00:01:34.270> bit<00:01:34.770> so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.260 

yes<00:01:39.240> here

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
yes here

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.760 
yes here
it's<00:01:41.600> better<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.020> get<00:01:42.140> your<00:01:42.260> picture

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.970 

looks<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.430> little<00:01:46.460> dreamy<00:01:47.440> here<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.620> step<00:01:48.830> back

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
looks a little dreamy here you step back

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:25.240 
looks a little dreamy here you step back
here<00:01:49.220> okay

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.350 

does<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.090> right<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.630> think<00:02:27.380> often<00:02:27.650> compete

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.850 

we're<00:02:30.870> like<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.290> industrial<00:02:32.150> park<00:02:33.150> area

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
we're like in a industrial park area

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.220 
we're like in a industrial park area
this<00:02:34.860> happens<00:02:35.430> all<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.120> time<00:02:36.420> when<00:02:37.110> you're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.960 
this happens all the time when you're
out<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.730> very<00:02:39.480> common<00:02:40.490> Florida<00:02:41.960> I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
out here it's a very common Florida I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.990 
out here it's a very common Florida I
started<00:02:44.970> using<00:02:45.210> this<00:02:45.480> camera<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.850> was

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
started using this camera and it was

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.950 
started using this camera and it was
like<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:49.460> now<00:02:50.460> here<00:02:50.670> watch<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.240> it's<00:02:51.780> kind

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
like this now here watch this it's kind

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:07.470 
like this now here watch this it's kind
of<00:02:52.020> hard<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> see

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.110 

so<00:03:09.939> that's<00:03:10.939> pretty<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:11.319> right

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
so that's pretty then right
