 still mayor 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.420
 UAH cheap quality 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 1300 1400 millimeters in size 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.550

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 let's go 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.790
 please tell us what it is 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.470
 pledge on them is different 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.850
 we can offer you how 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.320
 inexpensive so and high quality

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.160
 Inessa time please and how much 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.080
 they are standing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 price difference between inexpensive and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 high quality windows 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 is about 15 percent 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.719
 the price difference is of course substantial 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.039
 reason to use more 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.759
 expensive and high quality 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.990
 of materials 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 and components 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 so heavy 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.259
 and capital Alexander Iskandaryan so far I 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.520
 lean towards cheap it and repair 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910
 more comfortable it is noticeably lighter 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.390
 much cheaper 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 but I would like to understand more 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.180
 in detail 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.569
 All the same, this purchase is not for one year 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.649
 let's consider groped bottom more 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.700
 intently I invite you to our 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.699
 I request a research site 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.189
 ap 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.089
 and I thought we often think 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.830
 we take a closer look at the windows 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.089
 not only outside but also inside 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.530
 you will see their design 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.700
 and materials from which they 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 are made 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.439
 no big deal cheap fittings in 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.129
 cheap windows requires careful treatment 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.699
 as you can see the failure of quality windows 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.759
 all much 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 and now let's consider found a treasure 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.329
 you look more expensive 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.189
 quality button is much smaller 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.509
 deform 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.019
 and as a result, it is not geometrically 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.879
 distorted over time and not 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.539
 starts to skip drafts 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 want to know the reason 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.339
 Shanghai 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.219
 more expensive window made of 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.219
 profile with thicker walls 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.719
 galvanized reinforcement in 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.719
 quality cancellation is much more durable 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.579
 and besides, you're protected from streams 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 rust rust 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.429
 thicker with that as a profile and not 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.939
 only more weight but also greater strength 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.889
 quality window designs are not 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.429
 only more durable reliable 

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.699
 comparison with cheap 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.699
 they also hold the best heat 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.269
 what do you think now 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.759
 laptops weight cheap channel no longer seems 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.430
 I am an advantage specialists 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.259
 calculated that with quality windows 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.780
 by saving heat energy 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.580
 resources and service 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.039
 for two three years 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.319
 but not only pays off no difference 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.319
 start saving significantly 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
 15 A. What is your decision 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.629
 The first impression was 108 centuries 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.279
 in hard days and dear 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.949
 but then 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.029
 it became clear that 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.219
 whose quality windows it is 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.939
 result of use 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.939
 quality and durable materials 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.620
 and if you count 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.999
 how much is the difference 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.839
 heating costs for repairs 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.989
 to replace cheap windows in a few 

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:17.969
 years old 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.349
 then in perspective it turns out that 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.050
 quality fibers 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.020
 center only 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.689
 reliably the most economical 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.689
 in the end it is a bargain 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.889
 and tell me you are satisfied 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.439
 I am confident in my choice 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.839
 quality window will not serve faith and 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.749
 true for many years 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:45.409
 done so to speak medic 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.409
 thank
