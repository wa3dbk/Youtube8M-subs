00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.810 
to the jars and I find it easier to work
with<00:02:00.460> a<00:02:00.490> pitcher

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.860 

and<00:02:08.180> then<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.479> use<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.520> special<00:02:10.520> ball

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
and then I use this is a special ball

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.910 
and then I use this is a special ball
canning<00:02:12.040> funnel

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.420 

to<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.220> close<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.970> pint

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
to be close to about a pint

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.699 
to be close to about a pint
in<00:02:20.519> each<00:02:20.700> jar<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:23.099> if<00:02:23.280> my<00:02:23.430> recipe<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.120> correct

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
in each jar and if my recipe is correct

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.679 
in each jar and if my recipe is correct
you<00:02:25.709> shouldn't<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.129> much<00:02:26.310> liquid<00:02:26.819> left<00:02:27.299> over

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
you shouldn't have much liquid left over

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.250 
you shouldn't have much liquid left over
okay

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
okay

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
okay
put<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> lids<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.250> almost<00:02:32.400> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
put the lids on and you can almost you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.500 
put the lids on and you can almost you
can<00:02:33.150> almost<00:02:33.240> feel<00:02:33.720> how<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.110> grips<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:36.210> then

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
can almost feel how it grips and then

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
can almost feel how it grips and then
when<00:02:36.630> we<00:02:36.720> tighten<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.200> jars<00:02:37.640> we're<00:02:38.640> going<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
when we tighten the jars we're going to

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.330 
when we tighten the jars we're going to
tighten<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> way<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.170> then<00:02:40.830> loosen

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
tighten it all the way and then loosen

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.720 
tighten it all the way and then loosen
it<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> quarter<00:02:42.300> turn<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.830> allow

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
it like a quarter turn just to allow

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.630 
it like a quarter turn just to allow
some<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> air<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.810> escape

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.300 

tighten<00:02:50.750> loosen<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:52.920> take<00:02:53.130> our

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
tighten loosen and then we take our

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.570 
tighten loosen and then we take our
canning<00:02:53.760> tongs<00:02:55.190> which<00:02:57.020> these<00:02:58.020> are<00:02:58.580> designed

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
canning tongs which these are designed

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.130 
canning tongs which these are designed
for<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.360> ball<00:03:00.540> jars

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
for the for the ball jars

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.900 
for the for the ball jars
okay<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.120> go<00:03:03.240> into<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> water<00:03:03.810> bath<00:03:04.080> to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
okay then we go into the water bath to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.510 
okay then we go into the water bath to
the<00:03:05.910> boiling<00:03:06.300> water<00:03:06.540> bath<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.500> these<00:03:08.310> will

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
the boiling water bath and these will

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.660 
the boiling water bath and these will
process<00:03:09.110> once<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> water<00:03:10.500> comes<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
process once the water comes up to a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.300 
process once the water comes up to a
boil<00:03:11.940> which<00:03:12.240> it's<00:03:12.420> about<00:03:12.660> there<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:14.160> will

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
boil which it's about there we will

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.140 
boil which it's about there we will
process<00:03:14.760> these<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.360> 20<00:03:15.780> minutes<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.550> after<00:03:17.820> 20

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
process these for 20 minutes so after 20

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.550 
process these for 20 minutes so after 20
minutes<00:03:18.650> we're<00:03:19.650> gonna<00:03:19.740> take<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.190> jars<00:03:20.520> out

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.309 

and<00:03:25.800> if<00:03:26.430> you've<00:03:26.610> done<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.940> properly

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.259 

it's<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.099> this<00:03:31.250> one<00:03:31.400> already<00:03:31.640> sealed<00:03:31.909> what

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
it's like this one already sealed what

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's like this one already sealed what
you're<00:03:32.420> looking<00:03:32.750> for<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:34.519> top<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.909> the<00:03:34.969> lid

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you're looking for is the top of the lid

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.300 
you're looking for is the top of the lid
to<00:03:35.480> kind<00:03:35.689> of<00:03:35.780> concave<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.010> shows

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
to kind of concave in and that shows

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.789 
to kind of concave in and that shows
that<00:03:37.489> it's<00:03:37.640> been<00:03:37.790> sealed<00:03:38.409> now<00:03:39.409> you've<00:03:39.620> had

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
that it's been sealed now you've had

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.619 
that it's been sealed now you've had
that<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.430> know<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.640> heat<00:03:40.909> and<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.599> pressure

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
that you know the heat and the pressure

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.470 
that you know the heat and the pressure
have<00:03:42.530> expanded<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> lid<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:43.969> then<00:03:44.239> as<00:03:44.329> it

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
have expanded the lid and then as it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.339 
have expanded the lid and then as it
cools<00:03:44.780> its<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:46.069> sinks<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.670> or<00:03:46.879> con<00:03:47.239> caves<00:03:47.599> you

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
cools its it sinks in or con caves you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.229 
cools its it sinks in or con caves you
know<00:03:48.439> it<00:03:48.769> creates<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.220> vacuum<00:03:49.370> effect<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.060> net

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
know it creates a vacuum effect the net

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.869 
know it creates a vacuum effect the net
shows<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.799> jar<00:03:52.099> has<00:03:52.340> been<00:03:52.549> has<00:03:52.849> been
