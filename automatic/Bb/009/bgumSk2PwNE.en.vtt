00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.509
 I am critical of betting 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.400
 saint-germain of their two of their 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 matches that are that are not good of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 their sufficiency sometimes but on the other hand 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 where I meet you is that it wants 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.100
 not to say that others deserve to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 win when the psg does not make good 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.119
 matches or not do not do any means do not 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 are not up to the requirement 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 that we are entitled to place at the top 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.189
 it is nuance that often we have 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.240
 chosen explains not well are weary of evil 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.830
 to understand in what I mean 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.750
 because you're right to say it against 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.130
 lorient but in what gilbert they have 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 bad to win but the rides 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 it's a ballad ya ten thousand occasions 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.850
 yes except when there is the purpose of a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 everywhere but not relay the rate 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.809
 admit the bahais amy you do not care at 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.190
 number of occasions that the ride and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.239
 monaco yes it's something that is not 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.340
 not comparable 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 no, but it may happen 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.280
 thing that there can be a storyboard 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 cata 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 yes ok it happens in football but in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 the facts hear the Lorient say 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.470
 that they have big sandstone where they had 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.479
 hard to win but never life 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 never have the city ever said never 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.320
 to fall asleep minul it is then spoken of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 inefficiency talk about a problem 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.299
 offensive of lavezzi that is not good of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.460
 two we could expect more I 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.020
 okay but from there to say to maintain 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.580
 regrets in others that's 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
 anything is delirium 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
 that's it I think even the best 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 example of this theory there then after 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.080
 we will go to dream but the best 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.180
 example it's still the m when the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.310
 match against caen before the wounded and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 this problem of impossible change I 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.909
 Sorry they do not have salad 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.050
 and agents of the match at the end of the match 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.430
 we only hear them 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.410
 camp days and even 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.200
 commentators say the bet has failed 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.650
 lose paris this sounds like they played 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.180
 new 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.910
 they played nine he had more than 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.650
 players when finally it's a contest of 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.300
 monstrous circumstance but if we take 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 the game before the release when he was 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.240
 at eleven it's called it's the complex of 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.100
 small on the big the people want 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.380
 so much that the psg breaks his mouth 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.630
 that anyway when a team has 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 an opportunity against psg it's ten years 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.270
 of regret says michael vaudelle tells you 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.869
 me local 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.220
 everything is multiplied by ten everything is 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.550
 totally bloated when it comes to 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550
 psg
