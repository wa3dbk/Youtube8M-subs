00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.949
 so this trick is rather 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 close simple you can use 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.520
 entirely a card like this one here 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.989
 is a credit card to do it e 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.699
 then later maybe with a card from 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 game you have to start taking it like this 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.270
 with between two fingers in this way is the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 movement to be performed 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.070
 consists of bending to the point of the two 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.390
 fingers in this way that get to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 place the card parallel to the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.939
 land as in this case as you can 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.610
 see that thumb at this point 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.100
 let's go grab the card that will be 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.869
 between inches and talk about the hand then 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:46.350
 iron the head between the two fingers 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:49.409
 the folds and the position parallel to the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.840
 I go to grab it with my thumb 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.569
 in this way the card will be 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.859
 supported between thumb and palm of the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:06.270
 hand as in this case what 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:08.700
 will see the viewer will be at hand without 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 precisely from the card 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.220
 as you can see now to make it reappear 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 the card what if in your hand 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.510
 exactly with for the reverse movement 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.400
 then to insert the two fingers 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.829
 release the thumb like this e 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.470
 to stretch them in this way the 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:39.840
 card will reappear this movement a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 faster speed and doing a bit of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.670
 times and you will succeed from those of a 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.940
 a certain naturalness in the movement e 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.970
 at the beginning maybe it's as difficult as the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.739
 reverse movement you want to do in others 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.829
 ways to make it reappear as I go to see 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.410
 now however the movement is rather 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.870
 simple but basic winx once 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.450
 learned you can go through a house 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.230
 game that maybe is a little bit more 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.700
 difficult because it is the highest also 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.970
 in this case the movement always is 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.040
 same as you can see I explain my fingers 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.579
 and to the palm between the thumb and the iron 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.579
 hand the card
