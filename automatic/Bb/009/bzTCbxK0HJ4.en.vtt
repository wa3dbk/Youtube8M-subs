lower than the elbow

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.479 
lower than the elbow
look<00:02:10.610> something<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.390> right<00:02:12.340> or<00:02:13.340> I'll

look something like this right or I'll
see<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.629> back<00:02:14.900> arching<00:02:15.680> or<00:02:16.040> I'll<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
see the back arching or I'll see the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.319 
see the back arching or I'll see the
Bundys<00:02:17.870> way<00:02:18.049> up<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.409> air<00:02:18.439> so<00:02:19.340> when<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.060> try

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
Bundys way up in the air so when I try

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.509 
Bundys way up in the air so when I try
to<00:02:20.360> avoid<00:02:20.540> all<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.900> those<00:02:21.140> things<00:02:21.470> one<00:02:22.280> thing

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
to avoid all of those things one thing

to avoid all of those things one thing
that<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.760> can<00:02:22.970> do<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.659> make<00:02:23.840> sure<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.140> you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
that you can do to make sure that you

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.970 
that you can do to make sure that you
are<00:02:24.769> lined<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.159> properly<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:25.939> chaturanga

put it right above your elbows so you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.660 
put it right above your elbows so you
want<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> strap<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.159> about<00:02:37.280> as<00:02:37.400> wide<00:02:37.640> as

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
want the strap to be about as wide as

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.520 
until the strap stops you and then work
on<00:02:50.030> instead<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.510> letting<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.870> shoulders<00:02:51.200> dent

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530

a block under the thighs can also help

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.379 
a block under the thighs can also help
to<00:03:06.980> keep<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.340> position<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:08.629> again<00:03:08.900> from<00:03:09.109> plank

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
to keep the position so again from plank

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.229 
to keep the position so again from plank
shift<00:03:11.389> forward<00:03:11.840> lower<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.519> my<00:03:13.609> legs<00:03:13.879> are

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
shift forward lower and then my legs are

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.210 
shift forward lower and then my legs are
being<00:03:14.449> held<00:03:14.629> up<00:03:14.780> a<00:03:14.870> little<00:03:14.989> by<00:03:15.169> the<00:03:15.199> block<00:03:15.530> so

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
being held up a little by the block so

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.610 
being held up a little by the block so
that<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.549> practice<00:03:17.109> lifting<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.230> shoulder

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
that I can practice lifting the shoulder

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.140 
that I can practice lifting the shoulder
heads<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.129> pulling<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.609> shoulder<00:03:19.910> blades

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.430 
head you're dropping the flow of energy
we<00:03:58.280> want<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.579> create<00:03:59.060> energy<00:03:59.329> flow<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.019> our

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
we want to create energy flow and our

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.589 
we want to create energy flow and our
yoga<00:04:00.739> practice<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.639> we<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.940> move<00:04:02.389> the

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
yoga practice so that we can move the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.470 
yoga practice so that we can move the
energy<00:04:02.959> through<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.169> body<00:04:03.409> and<00:04:04.150> take<00:04:05.150> care<00:04:05.329> of

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
energy through the body and take care of

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.939 
energy through the body and take care of
any<00:04:05.659> blockages<00:04:06.229> move<00:04:06.500> them<00:04:06.620> out<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.859> way

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
any blockages move them out of the way

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.670 
any blockages move them out of the way
so<00:04:07.790> that's<00:04:08.000> chaturanga<00:04:08.449> another<00:04:09.319> thing<00:04:09.560> that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so that's chaturanga another thing that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.369 
so that's chaturanga another thing that
you<00:04:09.739> can<00:04:09.859> do<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.790> practice<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.599> if<00:04:12.139> you<00:04:12.229> don't

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
you can do to practice is if you don't

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.719 
you can do to practice is if you don't
have<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> strap<00:04:12.919> maybe<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.280> have<00:04:13.400> a<00:04:13.430> block

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:13.729 
have a strap maybe you have a block

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.289 
have a strap maybe you have a block
plank<00:04:14.599> pose<00:04:14.979> shift<00:04:15.979> forward<00:04:16.400> lower<00:04:16.609> down

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
plank pose shift forward lower down

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.779 
plank pose shift forward lower down
until<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.019> block<00:04:18.620> touches<00:04:19.219> your<00:04:19.370> chest<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
until the block touches your chest and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.840 
until the block touches your chest and
then<00:04:19.909> you<00:04:19.969> can<00:04:20.150> again

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
then you can again

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.430 
then you can again
just<00:04:21.030> lift<00:04:21.270> up<00:04:22.190> okay<00:04:24.530> jumping<00:04:25.530> back<00:04:26.690> if<00:04:27.690> you're

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
just lift up okay jumping back if you're

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.800 
just lift up okay jumping back if you're
just<00:04:28.710> starting<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.430> recommend<00:04:30.240> not<00:04:30.300> jumping

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
just starting I recommend not jumping

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.370 
just starting I recommend not jumping

back

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.140 
back
I<00:04:31.410> recommend<00:04:32.310> inhaling<00:04:33.150> up<00:04:33.440> exhale<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.470> fold

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
I recommend inhaling up exhale to fold

exhale back if you are wanting to jump

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.910 
exhale back if you are wanting to jump
it's<00:04:53.850> not<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.240> good<00:04:54.540> idea<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:55.110> jump<00:04:55.380> straight<00:04:55.800> to

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
it's not a good idea to jump straight to

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.520 
it's not a good idea to jump straight to
plank<00:04:56.420> so<00:04:57.420> I'm<00:04:57.660> not<00:04:57.750> going<00:04:57.900> to<00:04:57.960> do<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:58.320> just

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
plank so I'm not going to do it but just

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.040 
plank so I'm not going to do it but just
think<00:04:59.070> about<00:04:59.160> jumping<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.910> plank<00:05:00.270> especially

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
think about jumping to plank especially

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.170 
think about jumping to plank especially
if<00:05:01.140> you're<00:05:01.290> newer<00:05:01.700> you're<00:05:02.700> going<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.880> land

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
if you're newer you're going to land

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.810 
if you're newer you're going to land
with<00:05:03.570> straight<00:05:04.530> elbows<00:05:04.740> and<00:05:05.340> then<00:05:05.580> there's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
with straight elbows and then there's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.270 
with straight elbows and then there's
that<00:05:05.970> friction<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.720> jump<00:05:07.140> which<00:05:07.980> will

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
that friction of the jump which will

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.060 
that friction of the jump which will
probably<00:05:09.210> make<00:05:09.330> your<00:05:09.540> back<00:05:09.720> arch<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.740> we<00:05:10.860> don't

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
probably make your back arch so we don't

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.640 
probably make your back arch so we don't
want<00:05:11.310> that<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.210> happen<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:13.020> can<00:05:13.200> hurt<00:05:13.320> your<00:05:13.470> low

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
want that to happen it can hurt your low

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.890 
want that to happen it can hurt your low
back<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.280> can<00:05:14.460> also<00:05:14.730> hurt<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.510> your<00:05:15.630> elbow

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
back it can also hurt to your elbow

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.490 
back it can also hurt to your elbow
joints<00:05:17.270> so<00:05:18.270> if<00:05:18.600> you're<00:05:18.840> going<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.200> jump<00:05:19.410> back

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
joints so if you're going to jump back

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.040 
joints so if you're going to jump back
you<00:05:19.980> want<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.280> jump<00:05:20.520> back<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.970> land<00:05:21.330> right<00:05:22.020> in

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
you want to jump back and land right in

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.380 
you want to jump back and land right in
this<00:05:22.290> position<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:23.310> if<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:23.490> just<00:05:23.670> stand<00:05:24.000> and

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
this position so if you just stand and

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.540 
this position so if you just stand and
extend<00:05:25.140> your<00:05:25.200> arms<00:05:25.290> out<00:05:25.620> in<00:05:25.740> front<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:26.130> you<00:05:26.340> and

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
extend your arms out in front of you and

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.940 
extend your arms out in front of you and
then<00:05:27.210> just<00:05:27.480> bring<00:05:27.690> them<00:05:27.930> back<00:05:28.170> by<00:05:28.500> your<00:05:28.620> sides

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
then just bring them back by your sides

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.550 
then just bring them back by your sides
widen<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:29.970> collarbones<00:05:30.540> draw<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.200> shoulder

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
widen the collarbones draw the shoulder

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.290 
widen the collarbones draw the shoulder
blades<00:05:31.590> down<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.070> back<00:05:32.160> lift<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.730> belly<00:05:33.000> from

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
blades down the back lift the belly from

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.720 
blades down the back lift the belly from
the<00:05:33.480> legs<00:05:33.720> that's<00:05:34.380> pretty<00:05:34.680> much<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.550> way<00:05:35.580> you

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
the legs that's pretty much the way you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.130 
the legs that's pretty much the way you
want<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.000> be<00:05:36.120> in<00:05:36.300> your<00:05:36.420> chaturanga

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
want to be in your chaturanga

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.910 
want to be in your chaturanga
so<00:05:37.920> inhaling<00:05:38.490> up<00:05:39.830> exhale<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.860> fold<00:05:42.920> inhale

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
so inhaling up exhale to fold inhale

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.890 
so inhaling up exhale to fold inhale
halfway<00:05:44.250> up<00:05:44.490> keep<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.360> gaze<00:05:45.540> slightly

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
halfway up keep the gaze slightly

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.770 
halfway up keep the gaze slightly
forward<00:05:46.530> bend<00:05:46.710> then<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.950> start<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> palms

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
forward bend then you start the palms

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.090 
forward bend then you start the palms
and<00:05:48.780> if<00:05:49.020> you're<00:05:49.170> going<00:05:49.290> to<00:05:49.410> jump<00:05:49.650> keep<00:05:49.950> the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
and if you're going to jump keep the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.880 
and if you're going to jump keep the
gaze<00:05:50.280> forward<00:05:50.310> take<00:05:50.910> your<00:05:51.090> cup<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.690> land<00:05:52.560> with

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
gaze forward take your cup and land with

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.980 
gaze forward take your cup and land with
the<00:05:53.040> vent<00:05:53.220> with<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.520> elbows<00:05:53.850> bent<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.540> then

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
the vent with the elbows bent and then

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.890 
the vent with the elbows bent and then
inhaling<00:05:55.470> up<00:05:55.830> and<00:05:56.510> exhaling<00:05:57.510> back

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
inhaling up and exhaling back

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.180 
inhaling up and exhaling back
now<00:05:59.740> all<00:06:00.670> sim<00:06:01.150> ELISA<00:06:01.390> was<00:06:01.480> asking<00:06:02.050> about<00:06:02.190> that

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
now all sim ELISA was asking about that

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.250 
now all sim ELISA was asking about that
extra<00:06:03.670> chaturanga<00:06:03.880> that<00:06:04.330> I<00:06:04.360> put<00:06:04.600> in<00:06:04.690> sometimes

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
extra chaturanga that I put in sometimes

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.090 
extra chaturanga that I put in sometimes
so<00:06:06.220> if<00:06:06.970> you<00:06:07.900> want<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.320> work<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.680> extra

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
so if you want to work the extra

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.790 
so if you want to work the extra
chaturanga<00:06:09.340> it's<00:06:10.330> basically<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.170> same<00:06:11.410> thing

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
chaturanga it's basically the same thing

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.780 
chaturanga it's basically the same thing
as<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:14.050> regular<00:06:14.470> chaturanga<00:06:14.830> except<00:06:15.640> you

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
as the regular chaturanga except you

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.190 
as the regular chaturanga except you
have<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:15.940> press<00:06:16.240> straight<00:06:16.540> up<00:06:16.690> into<00:06:16.900> plank

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
have to press straight up into plank

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.100 
have to press straight up into plank
which<00:06:17.800> takes<00:06:18.130> a<00:06:18.310> little<00:06:18.490> more<00:06:18.870> strength

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
which takes a little more strength

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.190 
which takes a little more strength
so<00:06:20.230> it's<00:06:20.380> inhale<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.930> exhale<00:06:24.900> inhale<00:06:25.900> halfway

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
so it's inhale and exhale inhale halfway

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.440 
so it's inhale and exhale inhale halfway

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
what I see a lot of times which is kind

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.680 
what I see a lot of times which is kind
of<00:07:07.960> like<00:07:08.020> the<00:07:08.290> worm<00:07:08.560> so<00:07:09.370> it's<00:07:09.520> halfway<00:07:09.760> down<00:07:10.180> or

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
of like the worm so it's halfway down or

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.300 
of like the worm so it's halfway down or
all<00:07:11.020> the<00:07:11.230> way<00:07:11.260> down<00:07:11.560> and<00:07:11.890> then<00:07:14.130> that's<00:07:15.130> not

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
all the way down and then that's not

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.760 
all the way down and then that's not
good<00:07:15.460> for<00:07:15.490> your<00:07:15.700> back<00:07:15.880> either<00:07:16.150> so<00:07:16.840> better<00:07:17.530> to

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770

safe<00:07:19.990> I<00:07:20.320> think<00:07:21.190> with<00:07:21.370> our<00:07:21.580> yoga<00:07:21.880> practice<00:07:21.910> it

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 
safe I think with our yoga practice it

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.450 
safe I think with our yoga practice it
can<00:07:23.080> be<00:07:23.170> the<00:07:23.290> most<00:07:23.470> healing<00:07:23.770> thing<00:07:24.130> for<00:07:24.160> your

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
can be the most healing thing for your

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.220 
can be the most healing thing for your
body<00:07:24.610> but<00:07:25.270> it<00:07:25.360> could<00:07:25.480> also<00:07:25.660> be<00:07:25.870> the<00:07:25.990> most

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.230 
body but it could also be the most

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.320 
body but it could also be the most
detrimental<00:07:26.470> so<00:07:27.340> it's<00:07:27.430> really<00:07:27.670> important<00:07:28.240> to

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
detrimental so it's really important to

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.830 
detrimental so it's really important to
listen<00:07:28.570> to<00:07:28.750> your<00:07:28.870> body<00:07:29.080> and<00:07:29.730> never<00:07:30.730> never<00:07:31.270> take

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 
listen to your body and never never take

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.130 
listen to your body and never never take
a<00:07:31.900> pose<00:07:32.230> that<00:07:32.500> hurts<00:07:32.830> it's<00:07:33.640> not<00:07:33.880> worth<00:07:34.030> it<00:07:34.240> so

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
a pose that hurts it's not worth it so

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.830 
a pose that hurts it's not worth it so
