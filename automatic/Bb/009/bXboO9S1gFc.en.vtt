deck<00:01:51.600> needs<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.530> very

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
deck needs it because it can be very

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
deck needs it because it can be very
aggressive<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.700> same<00:01:53.909> point<00:01:54.149> needs<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
aggressive the same point needs to be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.740 
aggressive the same point needs to be
very<00:01:54.659> defensive<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:56.149> great<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> line<00:01:57.569> up

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
very defensive as well great to line up

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.819 
very defensive as well great to line up
we<00:01:58.140> run<00:01:58.350> four<00:01:58.679> of<00:01:58.979> our<00:01:59.399> burrows<00:01:59.909> dragon<00:02:00.299> timber

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
we run four of our burrows dragon timber

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.109 
we run four of our burrows dragon timber
when<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> grade<00:02:02.100> 3<00:02:02.250> rights<00:02:02.520> over<00:02:02.729> him<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
when the grade 3 rights over him you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
when the grade 3 rights over him you
again<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.689> clone<00:02:03.929> a<00:02:03.960> rear<00:02:04.560> guard<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.950> on

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
again can clone a rear guard that's on

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.950 
again can clone a rear guard that's on
the<00:02:05.280> field<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.149> again<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.539> can<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.810> make

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the field so again you can then make

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.839 
the field so again you can then make
another<00:02:07.170> copy<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.649> korlah<00:02:08.039> dragon<00:02:08.459> or

lot of counter blast in the deck exactly
you<00:02:38.730> actually<00:02:38.760> don't<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.599> lot<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.780> car<00:02:40.019> of

you actually don't have a lot of car of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.819 
you actually don't have a lot of car of
us<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.500> Dec<00:02:40.709> other<00:02:40.980> than<00:02:41.220> popcorn<00:02:41.640> and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
us in this Dec other than popcorn and

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.259 
us in this Dec other than popcorn and
trailing<00:02:43.829> rolls<00:02:44.100> trailing<00:02:44.579> rose<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.120> glass

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
beads and these guys are one he is too

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.960 
beads and these guys are one he is too
so<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.620> make<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.280> deck<00:02:50.519> work

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
so you really can make this deck work

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.509 
so you really can make this deck work
very<00:02:51.239> effectively<00:02:51.510> getting<00:02:52.170> him<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.470> hit<00:02:52.680> some

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
very effectively getting him to hit some

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.190 
very effectively getting him to hit some
people<00:02:53.760> go<00:02:53.850> they<00:02:54.120> should<00:02:54.299> run<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.660> this<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
people go they should run for this and

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.990 
people go they should run for this and
rather<00:02:55.440> than<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.829> only<00:02:56.459> problem<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.819> I<00:02:56.970> don't

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
rather than this only problem is I don't

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
rather than this only problem is I don't
like<00:02:57.209> say<00:02:57.630> when<00:02:57.780> Barbarossa's<00:02:58.620> affect<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
like say when Barbarossa's affect the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650 
like say when Barbarossa's affect the
main<00:02:59.310> banker<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.790> affected<00:03:00.209> I'll<00:03:00.480> guess

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
main banker it's affected I'll guess

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660 
main banker it's affected I'll guess
I'll<00:03:00.780> touch<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.139> now<00:03:01.380> his<00:03:02.069> effect<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
I'll touch on that now his effect is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.160 
I'll touch on that now his effect is
when<00:03:03.000> he's<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.420> field<00:03:03.600> there's<00:03:03.840> four<00:03:04.049> more

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
when he's in the field there's four more

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
when he's in the field there's four more
damage<00:03:04.530> his<00:03:04.680> limit<00:03:04.950> break<00:03:05.130> allows<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.609> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
damage his limit break allows you to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.710 
damage his limit break allows you to
give<00:03:06.230> 3,000<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.410> ability<00:03:07.889> to<00:03:08.519> allow<00:03:08.700> 3,000<00:03:09.600> to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
give 3,000 or ability to allow 3,000 to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.509 
give 3,000 or ability to allow 3,000 to
the<00:03:09.810> same<00:03:10.019> cards<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.620> field<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.100> basically

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
the same cards on the field so basically

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.069 
the same cards on the field so basically
if<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.940> two<00:03:12.150> men<00:03:12.299> controlling<00:03:12.569> roses

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
if you have two men controlling roses

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.259 
if you have two men controlling roses
they<00:03:13.560> each<00:03:13.739> get<00:03:13.920> additional<00:03:14.160> three<00:03:14.670> thousand

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
they each get additional three thousand

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.030 
they each get additional three thousand
if<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.109> iron<00:03:16.260> sights<00:03:16.590> they<00:03:16.829> come

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
if you have to iron sights they come

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.660 
if you have to iron sights they come
13,000<00:03:17.970> if<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.269> have<00:03:18.739> class<00:03:19.739> B's<00:03:19.950> dragon<00:03:20.370> it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
13,000 if you have class B's dragon it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.330 
13,000 if you have class B's dragon it
becomes<00:03:21.030> 12,000<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.079> best<00:03:22.290> part<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.769> then

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
becomes 12,000 the best part and then

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.400 
becomes 12,000 the best part and then
when<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.609> have<00:03:23.730> korla<00:03:24.090> dragon<00:03:24.480> he

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
when you have korla dragon he

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.880 
when you have korla dragon he
as<00:03:25.460> 3,000<00:03:26.460> plus<00:03:26.610> makes<00:03:26.940> 11<00:03:27.480> k<00:03:27.660> booster<00:03:28.260> which<00:03:28.770> I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
as 3,000 plus makes 11 k booster which I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.880 
as 3,000 plus makes 11 k booster which I
don't<00:03:28.950> think<00:03:29.220> any<00:03:29.460> other<00:03:29.550> deck<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.620> do<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.860> I

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
don't think any other deck can do that I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.500 
don't think any other deck can do that I
don't<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.310> can't<00:03:32.340> think<00:03:32.880> anyone<00:03:33.150> becomes<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
don't I can't think anyone becomes a
