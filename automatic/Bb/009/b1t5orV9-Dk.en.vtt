little<00:01:56.320> part<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.890> loading<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.960> can<00:01:59.170> go

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
little part of the loading so you can go

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.880 
little part of the loading so you can go
faster<00:01:59.770> on<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.160> tutorial<00:02:00.970> but<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:02.050> reality<00:02:02.259> it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
faster on the tutorial but in reality it

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.620 
faster on the tutorial but in reality it
will<00:02:03.130> take<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.490> while<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.610> window<00:02:07.030> shows<00:02:07.060> you

after<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.189> first<00:02:26.900> troubleshooting<00:02:27.900> I'm

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
after the first troubleshooting I'm

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.509 
after the first troubleshooting I'm
going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.739> try<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.569> flash<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.840> bias<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
going to try to flash the bias that you

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.119 
going to try to flash the bias that you
can<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.180> find<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.780> file<00:02:34.500> from<00:02:34.859> the

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
can you can find the file from the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.690 
can you can find the file from the
website<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.569> manufacturers<00:02:37.260> website

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
website that the manufacturers website

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.160 
website that the manufacturers website
they<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.730> download<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:39.659> downloaded<00:02:39.870> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
they can download it I've downloaded to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 
they can download it I've downloaded to
the<00:02:40.200> desktop<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.189> so<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.299> should<00:02:42.480> probably

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510

have<00:02:43.079> all<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.500> files<00:02:43.799> together<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:46.019> now<00:02:46.290> i'm

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
have all the files together and now i'm

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.839 
have all the files together and now i'm
going<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.920> run<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.269> setup<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:50.010> follow<00:02:50.430> the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
the Wi-Fi card and it should be working

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.930 
the Wi-Fi card and it should be working
now<00:05:44.240> but<00:05:44.750> for<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.650> safety<00:05:45.860> side<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.640> have<00:05:46.790> to

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
now but for the safety side you have to

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.670 
now but for the safety side you have to
just<00:05:47.150> check<00:05:47.510> it

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
just check it

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.590 
just check it
before<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:50.590> tighten<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:52.070> school's<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.910> tight

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
before you tighten the school's of tight

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.730 
before you tighten the school's of tight
but<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:54.680> just<00:05:55.009> remember<00:05:55.130> that<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:57.139> wires<00:05:57.410> are

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
but you just remember that the wires are

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.360 
but you just remember that the wires are
a<00:05:57.800> little<00:05:58.160> tricky<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:59.120> get<00:05:59.389> on<00:06:00.280> where<00:06:01.280> they

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
a little tricky to get on where they

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.700 
a little tricky to get on where they
belong<00:06:01.639> but<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.449> should<00:06:02.660> go<00:06:02.810> fun<00:06:03.050> really<00:06:03.500> it's

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
belong but it should go fun really it's

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.710 
belong but it should go fun really it's
not<00:06:03.860> that<00:06:04.220> hard<00:06:05.949> let<00:06:06.949> us<00:06:07.160> take<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.320> top<00:06:09.320> off

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
not that hard let us take the top off

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.020 
not that hard let us take the top off
just<00:06:11.720> do<00:06:11.960> it<00:06:11.990> tight<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:14.139> just<00:06:15.729> remember<00:06:16.729> that

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
just do it tight and just remember that

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.529 
just do it tight and just remember that
everything<00:06:17.449> is<00:06:17.780> okay<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:18.759> put<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:20.030> battery

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
everything is okay and put the battery

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.650 
everything is okay and put the battery
back<00:06:20.570> in<00:06:21.050> both<00:06:21.320> in<00:06:21.680> most<00:06:22.070> important<00:06:22.699> but<00:06:23.360> since

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
back in both in most important but since

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.050 
back in both in most important but since
you<00:06:23.810> have<00:06:23.960> taken<00:06:24.199> out<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.740> battery<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.789> bias

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
you have taken out the battery the bias

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.010 
you have taken out the battery the bias
will<00:06:26.419> reset<00:06:26.960> so<00:06:27.680> you<00:06:28.580> have<00:06:28.729> to<00:06:28.880> fix<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.419> clock

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
will reset so you have to fix the clock

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.499 
will reset so you have to fix the clock
and<00:06:30.349> the<00:06:30.440> date<00:06:30.740> if<00:06:31.430> you'll<00:06:31.639> probably<00:06:32.000> be<00:06:32.300> at

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:32.509 
and the date if you'll probably be at

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:36.249 
and the date if you'll probably be at
the<00:06:32.750> system<00:06:33.639> configuration<00:06:34.639> but<00:06:35.419> when<00:06:36.110> you

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
the system configuration but when you

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.170 
the system configuration but when you
have<00:06:36.410> done<00:06:36.740> that<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:37.280> should<00:06:37.490> probably<00:06:37.820> have

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
have done that you should probably have

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.360 
have done that you should probably have
a<00:06:38.210> working<00:06:39.020> network<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:39.710> everything<00:06:40.160> should

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
a working network and everything should

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.279 
a working network and everything should
be<00:06:40.400> fine
