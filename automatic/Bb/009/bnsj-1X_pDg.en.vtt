all of the colors combined to give you a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.490 
all of the colors combined to give you a
bronzer<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.209> sort<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
bronzer that's sort of like this but I

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.230 
bronzer that's sort of like this but I
want<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.459> kind<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
want you to know it's kind of

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.990 
want you to know it's kind of
warm<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:13.140> know<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.490> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
warm you know if you really like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.380 
warm you know if you really like
strictly<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.410> very<00:02:17.070> cool<00:02:17.400> tone<00:02:17.700> bronzers<00:02:18.210> I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
strictly the very cool tone bronzers I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.550 
strictly the very cool tone bronzers I
think<00:02:18.570> you'll<00:02:18.660> find<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.320> little

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
think you'll find this to be a little

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.560 
think you'll find this to be a little
bit<00:02:19.680> warm<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.820> there's<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.060> bit<00:02:21.420> of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
bit warm as you can see there's a bit of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.160 
bit warm as you can see there's a bit of
shimmer<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.370> really

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
shimmer going on there but it's really

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.720 
shimmer going on there but it's really
unidentifiable<00:02:25.170> once<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.830> swatch<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.550> out

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
unidentifiable once you swatch that out

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
unidentifiable once you swatch that out
and<00:02:26.970> once<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.240> see<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.510> on<00:02:27.690> your<00:02:27.870> face<00:02:27.930> depth

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
and once you see it on your face depth

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.230 
and once you see it on your face depth
wise<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.950> would<00:02:28.980> place<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.550> right<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.060> between

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
wise I would place this right in between

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.040 
wise I would place this right in between

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.410 
NYC sunny on the light end and too faced

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
chocolate soleil on the deeper end this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.420 
chocolate soleil on the deeper end this
is<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> right<00:02:37.500> smack<00:02:37.890> dab<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.340> middle

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
is kind of right smack dab in the middle

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.000 
is kind of right smack dab in the middle
of<00:02:38.760> those<00:02:39.000> two<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.660> depth<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.830> bit

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
of those two for depth but a little bit

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
of those two for depth but a little bit
warmer<00:02:41.630> especially<00:02:42.630> warmer<00:02:43.020> than<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> too

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470

faced<00:02:43.740> chocolate<00:02:43.920> soleil<00:02:44.310> bronze<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.180> think

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
faced chocolate soleil bronze I think

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.760 
faced chocolate soleil bronze I think
this<00:02:45.480> could<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.170> works<00:02:46.470> for

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
this could be something that works for

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.000 
this could be something that works for
light-skin<00:02:47.490> medium<00:02:47.760> skin<00:02:48.630> maybe<00:02:49.530> even

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
light-skin medium skin maybe even

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.130 
light-skin medium skin maybe even
getting<00:02:50.280> into<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.640> light<00:02:50.880> tan<00:02:51.330> skin<00:02:51.780> tones

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
getting into the light tan skin tones

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.290 
getting into the light tan skin tones
but<00:02:52.440> much<00:02:52.710> past<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.120> would<00:02:54.270> be

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
but much past that I think this would be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.270 
but much past that I think this would be
too<00:02:54.630> light<00:02:54.870> another<00:02:55.260> thing<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.710> can<00:02:55.800> do

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
too light another thing that you can do

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430 
too light another thing that you can do
with<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.940> use<00:02:57.270> them<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.600> eyeshadows<00:02:58.230> they

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
with this is use them as eyeshadows they

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.170 
with this is use them as eyeshadows they
don't<00:02:58.620> market<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.370> way<00:02:59.550> they<00:02:59.790> don't<00:02:59.820> even

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
don't market it that way they don't even

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
don't market it that way they don't even
talk<00:03:00.390> about<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.990> way<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> website

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
talk about it that way on the website

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.370 
talk about it that way on the website
but<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.460> mean<00:03:02.850> you've<00:03:02.970> got<00:03:03.150> these<00:03:03.420> clearly<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
but I mean you've got these clearly you

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.620 
but I mean you've got these clearly you
know<00:03:04.500> separate<00:03:05.220> shades<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.360> could<00:03:06.510> use

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
know separate shades here you could use

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.660 
know separate shades here you could use
them<00:03:06.840> as<00:03:06.990> shadows<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> did<00:03:08.430> do<00:03:08.640> that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
them as shadows and so I did do that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520 
them as shadows and so I did do that
today<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.090> didn't<00:03:09.480> even<00:03:09.570> shoot<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.200> wasn't

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
today I didn't even shoot it I wasn't

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.870 
today I didn't even shoot it I wasn't
even<00:03:10.680> thinking<00:03:10.740> about<00:03:11.070> it<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.580> first

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
even thinking about it this is the first

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.730 
even thinking about it this is the first
time<00:03:12.090> I've<00:03:12.270> used<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.660> as<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> shadow<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.680> took

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
time I've used it as a shadow and I took

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.010 
time I've used it as a shadow and I took
like<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.850> lighter<00:03:15.090> shades<00:03:15.570> put<00:03:15.870> that

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
like one of the lighter shades put that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.750 
like one of the lighter shades put that
on<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> lid<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.920> bit<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> peach<00:03:17.490> on

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
on the lid a little bit of the peach on

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.730 
on the lid a little bit of the peach on
the<00:03:17.880> lid<00:03:18.060> as<00:03:18.240> well<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.350> took<00:03:19.530> one

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
the lid as well and then just took one

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.560 
the lid as well and then just took one
of<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.950> deeper<00:03:20.310> shades<00:03:20.610> for<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> crease<00:03:21.240> and

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
of the deeper shades for the crease and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.810 
of the deeper shades for the crease and
it's<00:03:22.080> kind<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.650> warm<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.280> look<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:23.760> very

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
it's kind of a warm I look but very

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.720 
it's kind of a warm I look but very
natural<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.380> shades<00:03:25.680> definitely<00:03:26.250> showed<00:03:26.490> up

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
natural the shades definitely showed up

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400 
natural the shades definitely showed up
I<00:03:26.880> used<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.180> primer<00:03:27.450> underneath<00:03:27.870> runs<00:03:28.290> around

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
I used a primer underneath runs around
