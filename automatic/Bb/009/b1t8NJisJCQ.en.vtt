 your music mp3 files directly to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.830
 the speakers of this device are 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.330
 these quickly we are going to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.390
 and we're going to take it out I do not know if he wants the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.080
 box 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.810
 is I bought it in 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.450
 liverpool check in several stores all 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 have the similar price varies by 100 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.050
 200 pesos its cost is 3 thousand 300 pesos 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.110
 if you can find it cheaper in 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.920
 some other side then excellent joventut 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.920
 at that price 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.080
 it serves 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.880
 and this is what concerns us here now 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.640
 Quickly includes your cable included 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.640
 of current and smells any 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.799
 we are here the plastic 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.600
 we find ourselves here finally with 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.500
 our portable speaker to our 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.540
 portable functions 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.980
 This is in red with black too 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.340
 there was totally black and 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.090
 only of boldness on the edge of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.280
 horns 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.989
 I really liked it a lot this is a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.180
 very practical step and make for departures 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.060
 there I do not know everything logo I came up with for 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 outputs to the marqueza or some 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.390
 park there not be a decision 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 current at hand they want to put their 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.830
 music but good this would be like the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.130
 ideal device 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.320
 that will look and basically has nothing 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.330
 in the back so it's over 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.160
 watching there is a camera that I am not no 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 I'm checking what's being recorded 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.819
 here we have the severe usb post and 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.200
 also has the hearing aid port 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.120
 Well who do you listen to the music 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.510
 by the current his hearing aids and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.590
 also here we have the auxiliary lens 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 Well, if any device that you 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.060
 have no account with bluetooth or with 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.700
 nfc then connect their auxiliary cable here 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.459
 and they will transmit the audio 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.489
 here we have all the buttons for 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.030
 control them is the volume rotates its 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.709
 antenna for the radius of fm the types of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.810
 the different types of audio input 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.430
 that here you can select here the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.010
 bluetooth key is left pressed 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.959
 until it appears here that is 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.840
 connecting there you can see it says 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.730
 audio bluetooth is turned on and there 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.720
 change the music folders on him 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.070
 they play play start 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.940
 how this device connects here 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.400
 via bluetooth 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.799
 if you have an android device 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 that meets the characteristic of 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.740
 have nfc 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.950
 simply activate the on axes in your 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.950
 device 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.290
 in this case here I have my galaxy this 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.180
 it's a side 3 but it does not matter what it is 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.100
 any brand but with nfc not 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.100
 must have activated activated and is there 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.040
 in effect activated you just put it 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.450
 here opposite in this part of here that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.450
 has the blue led with white 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.709
 and the connection is going to give itself 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.709
 it also seems that he already recognized 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.880
 I'm healing 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.949
 and they put their music player 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.470
 I'm going to check here, it's really not 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.730
 I occupy myself in music 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.730
 returns connects 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.090
 they are sending it directly here 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.400
 how can we do anything else more 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.530
 to put it here so that it connects 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.220
 and it's automatically being sent there 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.220
 the audio 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.170
 and the audio 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.840
 since this is the source let's say 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:01.850
 Original music will simply 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.310
 low on the audio or you can upload it 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.190
 good so that's roughly the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.710
 volume is decent is not going to have well 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.900
 let's say a super sound are not going to 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.730
 fill bedrooms on a morning that the 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.220
 complete house but yes yes they can arrive 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.810
 without problems a room is heard 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.780
 pretty good without getting to 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.090
 distort as I say is not 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.530
 very very powerful but really meets 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.810
 with its function of having music in 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.730
 any side of your from your home even 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.320
 caught her goes in the car wherever she wants 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.110
 where you want to put it so 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.450
 will operate the battery completely 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.310
 charged and with the maximum volume goes 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.870
 to last between 4 or 5 hours at the most 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.090
 but also so that they have 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.100
 consider this fact if you go if 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.420
 planned long time on the street 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.460
 that's about four of those that you 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.740
 is going to give this this kind of duration in 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.240
 its battery and then if they have the current 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.850
 in his hand he simply connects in his 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.110
 cable and then they will continue to enjoy 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.520
 of his music 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.520
 then as I say you can share 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.680
 music via bluetooth via usb 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.780
 auxiliary and if you want to cancel the audio 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.810
 simply its audio and forms and there 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:10.759
 you only enjoy music 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.650
 has radio am / fm obviously this is no longer 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.020
 has to stop if you have compassion nothing of 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.860
 that totally digital here the subject 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.900
 it was broadly speaking this would be him 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.400
 As I can say, it's really not 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.819
 I have a name for this would be a 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.530
 portable kitchen a recorder as if 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.460
 you what calls and recorder and 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:35.000
 well that would be all I am triforce this 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.400
 video is for android mx and see you 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.110
 until next time remember that its price 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.330
 more or less to make the three thousand 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.800
 three hundred pesos three thousand pesos equal 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.500
 you can find it in bond offering 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.280
 sides with promotions I do not know then that 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:54.909
 would be what I know about the speakers 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.909
 that 20 and 55 see you until the next
