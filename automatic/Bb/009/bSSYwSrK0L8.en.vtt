00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 good at the time of getting up is a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.020
 little depending on the time you have 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.750
 the match or the training does not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
 normally we usually play the first 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.640
 turn of the morning at eleven is going to be 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.470
 you usually raise eight more or less 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 I also like quite sleepy 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.210
 that never sleep less than eight hours 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.080
 he even tried to sleep more than nine 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.970
 hours for to feel good prepared 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.900
 to face a day a hard day that is 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.900
 when when I play 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.090
 Well, I usually like to have breakfast 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.820
 cereals a little bread with sausage 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.820
 some yogurt and that's a little breakfast 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.050
 usually the day we have a match 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.720
 always what we do is heat a 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.060
 half hour first is a little bit in 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.150
 physical warm up afterwards as I've 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.430
 said a half hour playing with another 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.200
 partner with enough time for 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.420
 if we have to eat the right before 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 enter after having eaten is another 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.880
 time a physical activation to enter from 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.880
 hot 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.470
 a little while before being a little 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.880
 to your roll like this to concentrate think 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.330
 in the game with your coach to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 speak it for practically as if 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.320
 you want to face the game 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.780
 good on track because I land between point and 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.800
 point, I usually ask for the towel 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.480
 to have my time to think how how 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 face the next point as 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.580
 try to hurt the opponent 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.660
 practically and good a little going 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.660
 paused between point and point 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.730
 a little superstitious I know I'm good 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.610
 I think all the players are 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 we have our many ritual manias 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.920
 that we are trying to follow a little bit 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.950
 especially younger people who 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:47.049
 try to enjoy tennis so small 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.600
 Do not put pressure on this 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.480
 final is a game 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.000
 and make an effort that at the end of the tennis the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.540
 tennis is nice and this stop for 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.540
 enjoy it
