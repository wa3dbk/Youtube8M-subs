00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
forge in this episode we're going to be

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.959 
forge in this episode we're going to be
adding<00:00:10.650> these<00:00:10.889> zombie<00:00:11.309> stoppers<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
adding these zombie stoppers to the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.310 
adding these zombie stoppers to the
Windows<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.269> zombie<00:00:12.840> stoppers<00:00:13.170> are

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
Windows now zombie stoppers are

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.560 
Windows now zombie stoppers are
essentially<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.830> blockade<00:00:14.639> devices<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
essentially the blockade devices that

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.269 
essentially the blockade devices that
are<00:00:15.750> used<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:16.139> either<00:00:16.230> slow<00:00:16.619> down<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> zombies

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
are used to either slow down the zombies

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
are used to either slow down the zombies
or<00:00:17.520> stop<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.240> altogether<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.199> case

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
or stop them altogether in this case

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.750 
or stop them altogether in this case
we're<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.800> gonna<00:00:19.920> slow<00:00:20.160> down<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> zombies

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
we're just gonna slow down the zombies

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.550 
we're just gonna slow down the zombies
making<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.539> zombies<00:00:22.199> need<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
making it so that the zombies need to

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800 
making it so that the zombies need to
actually<00:00:22.740> physically<00:00:23.430> smash<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> pallets

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
actually physically smash the pallets

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.359 
actually physically smash the pallets
yet<00:00:25.109> through<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> lot<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
yet through so you can use a lot of

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
yet through so you can use a lot of
objects<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.900> use<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
objects for it but I just like to use a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929 
objects for it but I just like to use a
palette<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.920> guess<00:00:29.279> pallets<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> only

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
palette I guess pallets for the only

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.490 
palette I guess pallets for the only
real<00:00:30.090> breakable<00:00:30.539> ones<00:00:30.630> besides<00:00:30.900> Dominion

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
real breakable ones besides Dominion

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.810 
real breakable ones besides Dominion
shields<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> meeting<00:00:32.340> shields<00:00:32.610> wouldn't

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
shields but the meeting shields wouldn't

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.190 
shields but the meeting shields wouldn't
really<00:00:32.910> look<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.719> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
really look right in this kind of a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.430

particular<00:00:35.420> thing<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.719> i<00:00:36.750> guess<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> nazi

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
particular thing here i guess for a nazi

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
particular thing here i guess for a nazi

winning team of that match so let's say

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.220 
winning team of that match so let's say
they<00:03:25.790> played<00:03:26.030> team<00:03:26.300> slayer<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.720> alpha<00:03:27.050> team

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
won that match Alpha Team would then get

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.620 
won that match Alpha Team would then get
to<00:03:29.690> select<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.980> game<00:03:31.250> type<00:03:31.580> or<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:31.880> genre<00:03:32.510> of

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
to select the game type or the genre of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.570 
to select the game type or the genre of
forged<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.320> they<00:03:33.470> would<00:03:33.680> embark<00:03:34.070> on<00:03:34.310> the

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
forged that they would embark on the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.340 
forged that they would embark on the
type<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> forging<00:03:35.570> adventures<00:03:35.960> I<00:03:36.020> don't<00:03:36.290> know

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
type of forging adventures I don't know

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.110 
type of forging adventures I don't know
they<00:03:36.740> would<00:03:37.190> get<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.400> choose<00:03:37.550> a<00:03:37.610> type<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:37.880> map

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
they would get to choose a type of map

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.540 
they would get to choose a type of map
that'd<00:03:38.360> be<00:03:38.450> forging<00:03:38.750> from<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.230> preset<00:03:39.860> list<00:03:40.340> of

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
that'd be forging from a preset list of

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.910 
that'd be forging from a preset list of
maps<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.390> let's<00:03:41.630> say<00:03:41.840> alpha<00:03:42.230> team<00:03:42.530> won<00:03:42.709> again

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
maps so let's say alpha team won again

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.199 
maps so let's say alpha team won again
Alpha<00:03:43.280> Team<00:03:43.310> would<00:03:43.580> maybe<00:03:43.760> get<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.030> choose

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
Alpha Team would maybe get to choose

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.320 
Alpha Team would maybe get to choose
from<00:03:44.450> forging<00:03:44.959> a<00:03:45.250> slayer<00:03:46.250> map<00:03:46.520> or<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> Dominion

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
from forging a slayer map or a Dominion

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.800 
from forging a slayer map or a Dominion
map<00:03:47.510> or<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> flood<00:03:48.530> map<00:03:48.770> or<00:03:49.040> whatever<00:03:49.310> and

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
map or a flood map or whatever and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.290 
map or a flood map or whatever and
essentially<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:51.530> would<00:03:51.770> get<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.100> do<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.400> so

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
essentially they would get to do that so

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.970 
essentially they would get to do that so
both<00:03:53.510> teams<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:53.900> would<00:03:54.170> have<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.410> forge<00:03:54.680> that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
both teams then would have to forge that

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.250 
both teams then would have to forge that
for<00:03:55.370> our<00:03:55.550> left<00:03:55.940> forged<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.480> Slayer<00:03:56.840> map<00:03:57.080> say

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
for our left forged that Slayer map say

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.540 
for our left forged that Slayer map say
they<00:03:57.410> chose<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> slayer<00:03:57.890> map<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.340> both<00:03:58.520> teams

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
they chose a slayer map so both teams

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.610 
they chose a slayer map so both teams
would<00:03:58.910> be<00:03:59.000> forging<00:03:59.270> a<00:03:59.360> slayer<00:03:59.600> map<00:03:59.840> now<00:04:00.410> out<00:04:00.590> of

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
would be forging a slayer map now out of

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.050 
would be forging a slayer map now out of
those<00:04:00.740> two<00:04:00.800> Slayer<00:04:01.160> maps<00:04:01.430> they<00:04:01.880> would<00:04:01.970> have

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
those two Slayer maps they would have

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.430 
those two Slayer maps they would have
about<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.270> week<00:04:02.450> or<00:04:02.600> two<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.810> complete<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.320> I

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
about a week or two to complete it I

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.310 
about a week or two to complete it I
would<00:04:04.220> have<00:04:04.370> some<00:04:04.550> judges<00:04:04.850> come<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.330> and<00:04:05.540> they

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
would have some judges come on and they

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.050 
would have some judges come on and they
would<00:04:06.590> rate<00:04:06.950> those<00:04:07.130> maps<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.730> winning

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
would rate those maps and the winning

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.510 
would rate those maps and the winning
map<00:04:08.270> would<00:04:08.810> get<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.260> progress<00:04:09.740> on<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> next

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
map would get to progress on to the next

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.860 
map would get to progress on to the next
round<00:04:10.610> that<00:04:10.940> team<00:04:11.120> everyone<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.630> team<00:04:11.780> would

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
round that team everyone that team would

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.440 
round that team everyone that team would
be<00:04:11.959> fine<00:04:12.170> however<00:04:12.890> those<00:04:13.010> four<00:04:13.370> players<00:04:13.580> who

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
be fine however those four players who

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.900 
be fine however those four players who
didn't<00:04:14.930> make<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.860> better<00:04:16.040> map<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.549> map<00:04:16.700> that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
didn't make the better map the map that

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.370 
didn't make the better map the map that
lost<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.359> losing<00:04:17.690> team<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.080> forging

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
lost the losing team in the forging

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.380 
lost the losing team in the forging
contest<00:04:18.859> would<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.700> vote<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:19.940> one<00:04:20.120> of

contest would have to vote out one of
their<00:04:20.570> players<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.440> they<00:04:21.680> would<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:21.830> to

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
their players so they would have to

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.469 
their players so they would have to
remove<00:04:22.280> one<00:04:22.520> person<00:04:22.880> from<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> team<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.419> they

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.140 
would actually vote that person out so
they<00:04:25.520> would<00:04:25.640> need<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.880> vote

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
they would need to vote

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.719 
they would need to vote
let's<00:04:26.479> say<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:27.050> don't<00:04:27.350> know<00:04:27.560> some<00:04:27.860> one<00:04:28.340> person

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
let's say I don't know some one person

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.920 
let's say I don't know some one person
their<00:04:28.850> team<00:04:29.030> would<00:04:29.150> be<00:04:29.240> kicked<00:04:29.449> out<00:04:29.600> and

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
their team would be kicked out and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.270 
their team would be kicked out and
they'd<00:04:30.169> move<00:04:30.350> on<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> next<00:04:30.710> round<00:04:31.009> and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
they'd move on to the next round and

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.560 
they'd move on to the next round and
then<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.520> would<00:04:31.610> be<00:04:31.699> three<00:04:31.940> on<00:04:32.060> four<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.449> they'd

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
then it would be three on four so they'd

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.180 
then it would be three on four so they'd
be<00:04:32.690> at<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.810> disadvantage<00:04:32.990> for<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.650> forged<00:04:33.979> game

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
be at a disadvantage for the forged game

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.469 
be at a disadvantage for the forged game
so<00:04:34.430> they<00:04:34.550> would<00:04:34.669> need<00:04:34.789> to<00:04:34.850> play<00:04:35.000> extra<00:04:35.330> hard

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
so they would need to play extra hard

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.749 
so they would need to play extra hard
and<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:36.080> would<00:04:36.199> continue<00:04:36.590> on<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.009> it<00:04:37.639> will

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
and that would continue on and it will

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.820 
and that would continue on and it will
be<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> series<00:04:38.240> on<00:04:38.570> my<00:04:38.750> channel<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:39.289> don't<00:04:39.710> want
