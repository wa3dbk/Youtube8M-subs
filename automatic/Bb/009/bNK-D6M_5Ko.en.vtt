00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
right to get the victory we go and from

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.070 
right to get the victory we go and from
your<00:05:59.580> point<00:05:59.910> of<00:06:00.030> view<00:06:00.090> so<00:06:00.510> what<00:06:00.720> did<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.930> see

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
your point of view so what did you see

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.320 
your point of view so what did you see
that<00:06:01.200> you<00:06:01.320> were<00:06:01.410> doing<00:06:01.650> right<00:06:01.770> alpha<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.400> look<00:06:03.240> I

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
that you were doing right alpha I look I

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.030 
that you were doing right alpha I look I
thought<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.690> periods<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.290> game<00:06:04.500> obviously

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
thought in periods of the game obviously

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.790 
thought in periods of the game obviously
had<00:06:05.550> their<00:06:06.000> defense<00:06:06.450> center<00:06:06.660> seem<00:06:07.380> to<00:06:07.500> hold<00:06:07.650> up

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
had their defense center seem to hold up

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.590 
had their defense center seem to hold up
reasonably<00:06:08.250> well<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.550> I<00:06:08.700> thought<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.570> know

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
reasonably well and I thought you know

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.090 
reasonably well and I thought you know
we<00:06:09.810> worked<00:06:10.080> hard<00:06:10.320> for<00:06:10.530> each<00:06:10.590> other's<00:06:10.890> towns

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
we worked hard for each other's towns

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.800 
we worked hard for each other's towns
where<00:06:11.340> they<00:06:11.460> did<00:06:11.640> trouble<00:06:11.880> us<00:06:12.030> but<00:06:12.210> I<00:06:12.510> thought

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
where they did trouble us but I thought

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.180 
where they did trouble us but I thought
we<00:06:12.960> worked<00:06:13.140> hard<00:06:13.410> for<00:06:13.620> each<00:06:13.710> other<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.010> off

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
we worked hard for each other and off

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.440 
we worked hard for each other and off
the<00:06:14.340> back<00:06:14.490> of<00:06:14.520> hard<00:06:14.760> work<00:06:14.970> you<00:06:15.090> get<00:06:15.180> a<00:06:15.240> little

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450

like<00:06:27.390> one<00:06:27.600> hundred<00:06:27.810> percent<00:06:27.840> at<00:06:28.140> the<00:06:28.230> moment

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
like one hundred percent at the moment

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.170 
like one hundred percent at the moment
and<00:06:28.620> it's<00:06:29.100> a<00:06:29.130> long<00:06:29.310> year<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:29.730> we'll<00:06:29.850> just<00:06:29.910> have

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
and it's a long year so we'll just have

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.460 
and it's a long year so we'll just have
to<00:06:30.270> keep<00:06:30.390> working<00:06:30.450> out<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:30.960> hopefully<00:06:31.080> we<00:06:31.350> can

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
to keep working out and hopefully we can
