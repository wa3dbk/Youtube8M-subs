00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 we will talk to them about having torball is adapted sport and you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 may have never heard of it's the opportunity it's gone 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.829
 a balloon sport for the visually impaired the idea came from germany alain 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.489
 verbal exchange 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.640
 two teams of three players compete from their side 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.240
 the objective to pass a balloon containing some jackpot for the purpose 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.609
 opponent who occupies the full width of the harare pitch - a dozen players 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.789
 meet once a week but beware the mastodon 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.180
 positive point the moment of the facts between them so 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.600
 a history of money 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900
 I'm unhappy so have 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.370
 I will speak with one voice in my arms 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100
 for these tensions 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 to better revive this trunk 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970
 the accessories 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.880
 to avoid rebounds that would complicate the balloon thing for 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.190
 ability to ride desirable ground in the midfield between the two 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.080
 clans and as everything is played by ear the players bring an opponent in 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.640
 common 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.930
 the noise 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.520
 and stay focused on the ball because even though off the court 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.630
 you still need the circus these pickers who is there you are at this 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.860
 player and not to be deconcentrated because it only takes one second that the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.540
 player draws he is not focused and the ball is happy 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.520
 on the ground three rinks head players to orient themselves they find their position 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.180
 attacking the defender 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 my benchmarks also essential to assess the position of the opposing goal 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 and adjust his shot 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 I'm not easy to find my way 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.590
 then it was a good little 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.470
 how do we do it in a hurry 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.650
 buried next door or 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.540
 fiat who often has replacement problems 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.020
 the Strasbourg club has been in existence for over 30 years and participates 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.240
 year of a championship of France even more than in the valid ones 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.079
 in addition to its role of socialization 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.159
 to spend money of course but also to be together to play 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.440
 he proposes to overcome the handicap 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.640
 we are on the ground we are like the others except to deprive them of a goal 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.130
 and then basta just like on the carpets the bins I never thought about 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.049
 my handicap because public deficits the pure physical performance 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.180
 to tell me that his disability actually 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.260
 during two hours 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.549
 a pleasure that also has its constraints 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.440
 the blind can still need ball pickers and 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.980
 of escorts to enjoy their sport
