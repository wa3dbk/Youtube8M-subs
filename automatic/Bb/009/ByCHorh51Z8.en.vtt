00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.290
 we're used to seeing closed-circuit cameras in this kind of 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 establishments for security reasons 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.659
 They are everywhere 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:17.099
 but there is another type of observer specialists such as jamaica 'displace 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.619
 all our movements analyzing our commercial behavior and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.439
 selling the information to the manufacturers whose products they want 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 call our attention 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.710
 We study the behavior of shoppers in stores and throw if 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.200
 What we do is record three 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.160
 which leads us to understand the things that people do and because the sidewalks 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.600
 because they make the decisions that take 80% of the decisions that are made in a 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 establishment are made in an unconscious manner so that to use 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.070
 the typical research tools like the questions to the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.080
 exit from discussion groups 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.590
 they only give us superficial information compared to what really 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.750
 It happens in the store 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 the supermarket is an extremely competitive place 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.900
 there is a specific number of clients with a specific theme of money 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.700
 for the manufacturer the secret is that your product finish your shopping cart 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.110
 purchase 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.620
 the most extensive jobs are done in supermarkets we have a lot 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.700
 of cameras that follow people around the store and who observe 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 simply his way of buying 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.790
 we have up to 60 managed by a camera 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.230
 we also use fixed cameras 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.010
 pictures 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.920
 it can take 40 minutes to win everything a purchase in the supermarket what I 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.770
 It takes me about six hours of viewing to record all the movements that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.790
 make 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.370
 we write to them and we point out different codes for each action they carry out 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.370
 throughout your purchase 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.490
 in this particular study the supermarket has asked them to be worth the exhibition 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.580
 of dairy products 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.960
 a brand of yogurt and especially calls the attention of children is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 placed in a fault out of reach 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.169
 a retired the fund after what we learned from those organizations because 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.419
 in 25% of the elections 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.219
 children make them 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.869
 that's why we have downloaded the products for children 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.479
 to make it easier for them to interact with packaging and choose 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479
 themselves what they like 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.010
 for a manufacturer 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.050
 It is essential to place your brand in the right aisle at the right place in 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.559
 the right skirt 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.329
 can mean a difference of millions of euros and manufacturers the 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.329
 accident occurred by the place that suits them best 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.720
 madrid this half 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.809
 works for an aperitif maker week walkers 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 is the leading brand in the market 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.219
 have to testify if the chips are there in the best place of the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.309
 Supermarket 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:11.029
 and for it uses a very special equipment that is the north look 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.000
 do not worry about the ears 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.120
 in which you are going to look at the ears with this contraption put on your head 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.030
 ginobili the origin of this artifact is the amazonas 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.480
 they used it to design the interior of the space shuttle cabin 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.450
 id is wearing a lightweight helmet that contains a minicamera and an infrared ray that 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.489
 it is reflected in the cornea of ​​the eye 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.249
 universia the infrared ray follows the movement of the cornea roberti and that 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:47.689
 movement as a fixed radar is superimposed on that obtained by the camera by 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:48.439
 it 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.290
 they say yes in this way jin jin xing I get a picture of what they saw 5 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.419
 while my head moves 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.040
 in the circuit and superimposed and a white dot that jumps and that marks exactly 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.289
 where am i looking 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.709
 to carry out the experiment two kamikazes chose these buyers 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.019
 clowns and 7 10 and a tracer from my house to follow his visual knowledge 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.199
 while they walked by the april supermarket 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.199
 He told us what his ultimate goal was 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:23.379
 manufacturers have discovered that the best place for the product is towards 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.379
 half of the corridor on the bench that is at eye level 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.039
 it's because customers move faster when they turn to get in 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:31.930
 in the hallway 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.930
 only when they reach the middle do they put all their attention 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.020
 these brands discovered that the potatoes were in the middle of the aisle but in 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.400
 the wrong belly 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.770
 in the business say that the height of the eyes is against sure 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.409
 traditionally it was believed that the height of the eyes was effectively at 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.170
 eye level and that's why kicks are there however this medical 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.789
 believes that a shelf is found below recently the industry is 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.689
 he believed that the height of the eyes really corresponded to the height of 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.639
 the eyes but what we have learned with the transport looks is that normally 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.900
 we look between 15 and 30 degrees below 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.750
 the height of the eyes is down here and not up here we look down from 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.080
 Instinctively, it is an effort to look towards what is traditionally 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 I considered the height of the eyes 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.330
 It is very interesting 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.379
 you never really realize what it takes to calculate the disposition of 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.629
 the store if what you take away purchases a product 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:31.789
 apart from the price
