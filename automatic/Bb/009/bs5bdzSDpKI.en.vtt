over<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> top<00:00:37.250> pastor<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
over the top pastor there's a lot of

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.280 
over the top pastor there's a lot of
different<00:00:38.940> paths<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
different paths that you can make that I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340 
different paths that you can make that I
think<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> down<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.780> makes<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
think if you can get it down it makes it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
think if you can get it down it makes it
easy<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.399> receiver<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> plate

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
easy for the receiver to make a plate

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
easy for the receiver to make a plate
when<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.750> catch<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> ball<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:47.039> obviously

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
when they catch the ball so obviously

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.619 
when they catch the ball so obviously
passing<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.210> them<00:00:48.329> i<00:00:49.100> would<00:00:50.100> say

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
passing is one of them i would say

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
passing is one of them i would say
shooting<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.840> definitely<00:00:52.620> another

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
shooting is definitely another

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.910 
shooting is definitely another
fundamental<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.940> i<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.480> lost

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
fundamental right i think it's lost

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.529 
fundamental right i think it's lost
sometimes<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> kids<00:00:57.360> at

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
this day and age and the last one I

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
this day and age and the last one I
would<00:00:59.609> say<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.120> triplet<00:01:00.420> being<00:01:01.320> able<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
