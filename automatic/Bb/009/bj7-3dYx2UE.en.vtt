the<00:00:35.010> apple<00:00:35.610> shape<00:00:35.820> girls<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.559> gain

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
I would just either stay away from them
or<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.140> careful<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:46.710> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
or just be really careful when you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
or just be really careful when you're
choosing<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.610> take<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> good<00:00:48.329> look<00:00:48.600> in

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
choosing them like take a good look in

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
choosing them like take a good look in
the<00:00:48.930> mirror<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.950> trying<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the mirror when you're trying them on

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.569 
the mirror when you're trying them on
and<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> works<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> works

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and just see if it works if it works

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.229 
and just see if it works if it works
then<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.000> fine<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:56.239> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
then that's fine but if it doesn't it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569 
then that's fine but if it doesn't it
doesn't<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> reason<00:00:58.890> why<00:00:59.309> they

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
doesn't I think the reason why they

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.250 
doesn't I think the reason why they
don't<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.940> work<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.359> Apple<00:01:00.750> shapes<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
don't really work with Apple shapes is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
don't really work with Apple shapes is
just<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.940> drawing<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.539> much

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
just because it's drawing so much

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.710 
just because it's drawing so much
attention<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.199> your<00:01:05.159> midsection<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.390> that's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
attention to your midsection and that's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.710 
attention to your midsection and that's
where<00:01:07.280> your<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> white<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.970> wider<00:01:09.330> part

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
where your kind of white it wider part

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
where your kind of white it wider part
is<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.650> don't<00:01:10.860> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> draw<00:01:11.369> attention

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is and you don't want to draw attention

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.510 
is and you don't want to draw attention
there<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> only<00:01:13.170> reason<00:01:13.530> why<00:01:13.650> they

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
there so that's the only reason why they

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.160 
there so that's the only reason why they
don't<00:01:14.640> tend<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> work<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.840> Apple

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
don't tend to work as well in Apple

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.700 
don't tend to work as well in Apple
shapes<00:01:16.850> otherwise<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.530> good

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
shapes otherwise it's a really good

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
shapes otherwise it's a really good
piece<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> wear<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.630> wardrobe

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
classic because the high-waisted skirt

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.870 
classic because the high-waisted skirt
is<00:04:43.630> quite<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:43.930> classic<00:04:44.380> piece<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.950> you<00:04:45.670> don't

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
want to roughen it up too much because

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.340 
want to roughen it up too much because
it<00:04:48.460> just<00:04:48.580> won't<00:04:48.820> fit<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.270> style<00:04:49.570> also

flip-flops<00:05:23.800> just<00:05:24.400> because<00:05:24.730> again<00:05:25.380> it's<00:05:26.380> a

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
flip-flops just because again it's a

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.680 
flip-flops just because again it's a
different<00:05:26.710> style<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.820> high-waisted<00:05:28.210> skirt

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
it doesn't really make much sense also a

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.180 
it doesn't really make much sense also a
cute<00:05:31.240> way<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.420> wearing<00:05:32.320> high-waisted<00:05:32.620> skirts

cute way of wearing high-waisted skirts

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.820 
cute way of wearing high-waisted skirts
is<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:34.000> cinch<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.600> waist<00:05:34.630> even<00:05:35.080> further<00:05:35.500> with

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
is to cinch the waist even further with

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.370 
is to cinch the waist even further with
a<00:05:35.860> belt<00:05:36.340> because<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.390> waist<00:05:37.600> buns<00:05:37.900> are

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
a belt because the waist buns are

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.450 
a belt because the waist buns are
usually<00:05:38.950> so<00:05:39.190> thick<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:40.750> looks<00:05:40.990> really<00:05:41.140> good

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
little bit more sophisticated and it's

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.580 
little bit more sophisticated and it's
not<00:06:07.360> really<00:06:07.600> something<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:08.200> you'd<00:06:08.380> wear

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
not really something that you'd wear

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.220 
not really something that you'd wear
like<00:06:08.860> at<00:06:09.460> home<00:06:09.790> or<00:06:10.180> you<00:06:10.660> know<00:06:10.780> if<00:06:10.900> you're<00:06:10.960> going

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
like at home or you know if you're going

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.710 
like at home or you know if you're going
shopping<00:06:11.710> or<00:06:12.190> if<00:06:12.880> you're<00:06:13.120> just<00:06:13.330> going<00:06:13.570> to

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
shopping or if you're just going to

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.320 
shopping or if you're just going to
school<00:06:14.250> or<00:06:15.250> anything<00:06:15.310> like<00:06:15.670> that<00:06:15.730> it's<00:06:16.120> not

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
school or anything like that it's not

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.710 
school or anything like that it's not
really<00:06:16.660> suitable<00:06:17.350> for<00:06:17.500> that<00:06:17.770> I<00:06:17.800> think<00:06:18.720> because

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
really suitable for that I think because

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.790 
really suitable for that I think because
it<00:06:19.930> is<00:06:19.960> that<00:06:20.380> little<00:06:21.340> bit<00:06:21.550> more<00:06:21.790> dressed<00:06:22.150> up

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
it is that little bit more dressed up

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.560 
it is that little bit more dressed up
but<00:06:23.800> on<00:06:24.160> the<00:06:24.460> other<00:06:24.580> hand<00:06:24.850> if<00:06:25.180> you're<00:06:25.390> talking

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
but on the other hand if you're talking

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.540 
but on the other hand if you're talking
about<00:06:25.810> like<00:06:26.530> a<00:06:26.590> skirt<00:06:26.919> that<00:06:26.950> I'm<00:06:27.250> wearing

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
right now which is I mean it comes to

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.770
