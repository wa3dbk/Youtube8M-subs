come<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.939> accelerated<00:01:30.630> fashion<00:01:31.320> it's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
come out in an accelerated fashion it's

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.569 
come out in an accelerated fashion it's
gonna<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.740> faster<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> bullets<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.490> gonna

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
gonna be faster the bullets are gonna

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
gonna be faster the bullets are gonna
get<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.030> clip<00:01:33.240> quicker<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.140> know

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
get out of your clip quicker you know

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.270 
get out of your clip quicker you know
they're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.470> hit<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.770> person<00:01:35.100> quicker

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
they're gonna hit your person quicker

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
they're gonna hit your person quicker
they're<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.579> die<00:01:35.790> quicker<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:37.710> got

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they're gonna die quicker so that got

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
they're gonna die quicker so that got
taken<00:01:38.100> off<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> gun<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.090> really

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
taken off of the gun does that really

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.859 
taken off of the gun does that really
matter

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
matter

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.660 
matter
yeah<00:01:40.350> matters<00:01:40.740> because<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> changes<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> way

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
yeah matters because it changes the way

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.130 
yeah matters because it changes the way
the<00:01:41.790> game<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:41.970> played<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> how<00:01:42.720> everything<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the game is played and how everything is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 
the game is played and how everything is
gonna<00:01:43.259> pan<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> doesn't<00:01:45.149> really

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
gonna pan out now but it doesn't really

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.050 
gonna pan out now but it doesn't really
matter<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> long<00:01:45.990> run<00:01:46.229> because<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.880> gun

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
matter in the long run because the gun

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
matter in the long run because the gun
needed<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.930> nerfed<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.350> needed<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
needed to be nerfed that needed to be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.139 
needed to be nerfed that needed to be
taken<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> gun<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.700> every

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
taken off the gun I think every

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.359 
taken off the gun I think every
everybody<00:01:51.840> could<00:01:52.049> agree<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
everybody could agree with that the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
everybody could agree with that the
amount<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> randomness<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> added<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
amount of randomness that I added to the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.100 
amount of randomness that I added to the
game<00:01:55.229> when<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:56.130> someone<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.110> put

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
game when you would see someone and put

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.719 
game when you would see someone and put
like<00:01:58.320> 1<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:58.560> 2<00:01:58.680> bullets<00:01:59.070> into<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.610> then

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
like 1 or 2 bullets into them and then

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.980 
like 1 or 2 bullets into them and then
the<00:01:59.790> next<00:01:59.850> thing<00:02:00.149> you're<00:02:00.299> dead<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the next thing you're dead because the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.719 
the next thing you're dead because the
gun<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.320> shoots<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.799> fast<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.340> those<00:02:02.430> first

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
gun just shoots so fast with those first

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
gun just shoots so fast with those first
couple<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> bullets<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.509> hit<00:02:03.659> all<00:02:03.780> their

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
couple of bullets and they hit all their

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.719 
couple of bullets and they hit all their
shots<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:04.860> there's<00:02:05.159> still<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.399> little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
shots yeah there's still a little bit of

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.249 
shots yeah there's still a little bit of
skill<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.509> really<00:02:06.810> annoying

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
skill in it but it was really annoying

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.040 
skill in it but it was really annoying
when<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.619> happened

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
when it happened

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.320 
when it happened
because<00:02:08.320> against<00:02:09.190> pro<00:02:09.340> players<00:02:09.640> if<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.120> miss

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
because against pro players if you miss

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.670 
because against pro players if you miss
one<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.570> your<00:02:10.690> shots<00:02:10.960> you're<00:02:11.200> just<00:02:11.350> screwed

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
one of your shots you're just screwed

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.780 
one of your shots you're just screwed
and<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.750> what<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.770> agree<00:02:15.760> with

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and it is what it is so I agree with

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
and it is what it is so I agree with
that<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.720> they're<00:02:16.870> taking<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.290> off<00:02:17.410> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that that they're taking it off it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.370 
that that they're taking it off it
reminded<00:02:17.950> me<00:02:18.040> much<00:02:18.280> like<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.880> ak-12<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.110> think

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
reminded me much like the ak-12 I think

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.050 
reminded me much like the ak-12 I think
it<00:02:20.470> was<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.770> black<00:02:20.890> ops<00:02:21.130> 2<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.640> had<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.850> same

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
it was in black ops 2 that had the same

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.480 
it was in black ops 2 that had the same
sort<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.600> deal<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.530> first<00:02:23.710> couple<00:02:24.010> bullets<00:02:24.340> I

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
sort of deal the first couple bullets I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.740 
sort of deal the first couple bullets I
think<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.700> was<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.880> first<00:02:25.090> two<00:02:25.300> bullets<00:02:25.600> would

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
think it was the first two bullets would

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.910 
think it was the first two bullets would
shoot<00:02:25.930> faster<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:28.170> agree<00:02:29.170> with<00:02:29.200> them<00:02:29.530> taking

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
shoot faster so I agree with them taking

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
shoot faster so I agree with them taking
that<00:02:30.040> off<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.430> think<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:30.910> needed<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> do

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that off I think that they needed to do

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.610 
that off I think that they needed to do
that<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.750> takes<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.080> whole<00:02:32.260> bunch<00:02:32.470> of

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that it takes a whole bunch of

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.340 
that it takes a whole bunch of
randomness<00:02:32.950> out<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> game<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:34.600> takes<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
randomness out of the game it takes a

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.900 
randomness out of the game it takes a
little<00:02:35.470> bit<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.860> connection<00:02:36.370> war<00:02:36.640> out<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
little bit of the connection war out of

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.490 
little bit of the connection war out of
the<00:02:36.970> game<00:02:37.150> too<00:02:37.420> because<00:02:37.990> if<00:02:38.110> someone<00:02:38.350> with<00:02:38.440> a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the game too because if someone with a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.490 
the game too because if someone with a
good<00:02:38.620> connection<00:02:39.130> would<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.550> absolutely

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
good connection would just absolutely

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.230 
good connection would just absolutely
obliterate<00:02:41.500> people<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.550> bad<00:02:42.760> connections

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
obliterate people with bad connections

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.740 
obliterate people with bad connections
with<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.450> asm1<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.940> agree<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.120> now

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
with the asm1 so I agree with that now

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.570 
with the asm1 so I agree with that now
what<00:02:47.230> people<00:02:47.380> were<00:02:47.710> mad<00:02:47.890> about<00:02:48.190> was<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.370> they

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
what people were mad about was that they

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.360 
what people were mad about was that they
did<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.970> before<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.840> major<00:02:50.380> tournament<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
did it before a major tournament now I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.340 
did it before a major tournament now I
don't<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:52.030> see<00:02:52.330> regionals<00:02:52.870> as<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> major

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
don't really see regionals as a major

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.830 
don't really see regionals as a major
tournament<00:02:53.800> simply<00:02:54.340> for<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.580> fact<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:54.970> if

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
tournament simply for the fact that if

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.570 
tournament simply for the fact that if
you<00:02:56.080> go<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.380> regionals<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.100> I'm<00:02:57.190> not<00:02:57.340> trying

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
you go to regionals and I'm not trying

the<00:04:30.010> gun<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:32.169> don't<00:04:32.620> really

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
the gun it's it's you so I don't really

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.620 
the gun it's it's you so I don't really
care<00:04:33.250> about<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.700> because<00:04:33.880> they<00:04:34.240> are<00:04:34.270> using

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
care about that because they are using

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.930 
care about that because they are using
pre<00:04:34.780> patch<00:04:34.990> now<00:04:35.320> if<00:04:35.620> they<00:04:36.340> wouldn't<00:04:36.669> have<00:04:36.820> been

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
pre patch now if they wouldn't have been

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.190 
pre patch now if they wouldn't have been
using<00:04:37.240> pre<00:04:37.450> patch<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.930> they<00:04:37.990> would<00:04:38.110> have

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
using pre patch and they would have

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.230 
using pre patch and they would have
updated<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.680> Xbox's<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.550> patch<00:04:39.700> now<00:04:40.000> then

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
updated the Xbox's to the patch now then

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.280 
updated the Xbox's to the patch now then
it<00:04:40.330> would<00:04:40.419> have<00:04:40.510> been<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.630> little<00:04:40.750> difficult

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
it would have been a little difficult

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.400 
it would have been a little difficult
because<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:43.150> just<00:04:43.450> it's<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.780> new<00:04:43.930> learning

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
because it's just it's a new learning

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.050 
because it's just it's a new learning
curve<00:04:44.620> like<00:04:44.889> different<00:04:45.340> scenarios<00:04:45.790> play<00:04:46.030> out

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
curve like different scenarios play out

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.080 
curve like different scenarios play out
differently<00:04:47.310> different<00:04:48.310> situations<00:04:48.910> will

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
differently different situations will

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.030 
differently different situations will
now<00:04:49.210> be<00:04:49.419> played<00:04:49.660> differently<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.500> might<00:04:50.919> even

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
now be played differently it might even

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.620 
now be played differently it might even
turn<00:04:51.310> into<00:04:51.520> eight<00:04:51.700> boughs<00:04:51.910> again<00:04:52.270> so<00:04:52.479> that's

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
turn into eight boughs again so that's

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.180 
turn into eight boughs again so that's
what<00:04:52.810> I'm<00:04:52.990> like<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.380> little<00:04:53.680> bit<00:04:53.800> worried<00:04:54.010> about

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
what I'm like a little bit worried about

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.950 
what I'm like a little bit worried about
because<00:04:54.460> I'm<00:04:54.580> a<00:04:54.639> sub<00:04:54.880> player<00:04:55.150> at<00:04:55.450> heart<00:04:55.750> I

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
because I'm a sub player at heart I

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.500 
because I'm a sub player at heart I
don't<00:04:56.889> really<00:04:57.220> mind<00:04:57.520> eight<00:04:57.790> bells<00:04:58.030> on<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.330> map

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
don't really mind eight bells on the map

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.570 
don't really mind eight bells on the map
I<00:04:58.660> liked<00:04:58.870> MLG<00:04:59.320> Columbus<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.860> first<00:05:00.070> event<00:05:00.370> I

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
I liked MLG Columbus the first event I

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.890 
I liked MLG Columbus the first event I
thought<00:05:00.850> it<00:05:00.940> was<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> lot<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.240> fun<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.660> really

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
thought it was a lot of fun I really

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.240 
thought it was a lot of fun I really
enjoyed<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.290> gameplay<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.710> really<00:05:03.010> enjoyed

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
enjoyed the gameplay I really enjoyed

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.550 
enjoyed the gameplay I really enjoyed
the<00:05:03.370> movement<00:05:03.820> using<00:05:04.720> everyone<00:05:05.139> using<00:05:05.410> boughs

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
the movement using everyone using boughs

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.440 
the movement using everyone using boughs
really<00:05:06.160> really<00:05:06.520> shows<00:05:06.850> who<00:05:07.120> has<00:05:07.270> good

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
really really shows who has good

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.409 
really really shows who has good
movement<00:05:07.930> as<00:05:08.080> opposed<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:09.210> situational<00:05:10.210> plays

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
movement as opposed to situational plays

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.760 
movement as opposed to situational plays
where<00:05:10.660> someone<00:05:10.900> has<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.020> sub<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.440> someone<00:05:11.680> has

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
where someone has a sub and someone has

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.940 
where someone has a sub and someone has
a<00:05:11.800> bow<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.389> don't<00:05:14.350> think<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.740> it's<00:05:14.860> going

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
a bow so I don't think that it's going

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.300 
a bow so I don't think that it's going
to<00:05:15.040> come<00:05:15.250> to<00:05:15.400> that<00:05:15.430> but<00:05:16.320> it<00:05:17.320> might<00:05:17.830> because<00:05:18.160> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
to come to that but it might because the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.040 
to come to that but it might because the
Bal<00:05:18.490> is<00:05:18.729> really<00:05:19.180> freakin<00:05:19.570> good<00:05:19.600> at<00:05:19.810> close

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
Bal is really freakin good at close

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.870 
Bal is really freakin good at close
range<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.800> Bal<00:05:20.979> accelerates<00:05:21.639> the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
range and the Bal accelerates the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.430 
range and the Bal accelerates the
farther<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.450> get<00:05:22.660> into<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.900> clip<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.289> gets

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
farther you get into the clip it gets

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.480 
farther you get into the clip it gets
faster<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.610> if<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.330> sub<00:05:25.570> player<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:26.139> close<00:05:27.100> range

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
faster so if a sub player is close range

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.370 
faster so if a sub player is close range
with<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.700> Bal<00:05:27.970> with<00:05:28.389> no<00:05:28.630> acceleration<00:05:29.260> on<00:05:29.350> the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
with a Bal with no acceleration on the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.740 
with a Bal with no acceleration on the
SM<00:05:29.770> one<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.950> feel<00:05:30.220> like<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.550> bow<00:05:30.700> can<00:05:31.090> still<00:05:31.539> win

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
SM one I feel like the bow can still win

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.600 
SM one I feel like the bow can still win
a<00:05:31.780> lot<00:05:32.020> of<00:05:32.110> those<00:05:32.229> gun<00:05:32.440> fights<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.950> that's

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
a lot of those gun fights and that's

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.900 
a lot of those gun fights and that's
what<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.940> SM<00:05:34.300> one<00:05:34.479> burst<00:05:34.810> sort<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.380> gave<00:05:36.250> the

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
what the SM one burst sort of gave the

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.460 
what the SM one burst sort of gave the
advantage<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.570> sub<00:05:37.780> player<00:05:38.050> at<00:05:38.260> close

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
advantage to the sub player at close

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.590 
advantage to the sub player at close
range<00:05:38.770> because<00:05:39.130> it<00:05:39.160> shot<00:05:39.669> so<00:05:39.970> much<00:05:40.180> faster

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
range because it shot so much faster

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.340 
range because it shot so much faster
than<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.840> bow<00:05:40.990> right<00:05:41.320> off<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.650> start<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:43.350> it

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
than the bow right off the start so it

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.430 
than the bow right off the start so it
could<00:05:44.740> change<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:45.789> don't<00:05:46.750> think<00:05:47.139> it<00:05:47.289> will

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
could change that I don't think it will

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.560 
could change that I don't think it will
I<00:05:47.800> hope<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.220> doesn't<00:05:48.580> because<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:48.940> really<00:05:49.389> like

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
I hope it doesn't because I really like

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.390 
I hope it doesn't because I really like
using<00:05:49.810> there<00:05:50.139> someone<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.889> I<00:05:51.010> said<00:05:51.220> I'm<00:05:51.340> a

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
using there someone like I said I'm a

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.909 
using there someone like I said I'm a
sub<00:05:51.610> player<00:05:51.850> so<00:05:52.270> I<00:05:52.510> really<00:05:53.470> hope<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.800> it

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
sub player so I really hope that it

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.310 
sub player so I really hope that it
doesn't<00:05:54.190> turn<00:05:54.310> into<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.580> pals<00:05:54.910> but<00:05:55.330> on<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.200> off

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
doesn't turn into a pals but on the off

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.810 
doesn't turn into a pals but on the off
chance<00:05:56.350> that<00:05:56.710> it<00:05:56.889> does<00:05:57.039> I'm<00:05:57.280> not<00:05:57.430> gonna<00:05:57.580> sit

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
chance that it does I'm not gonna sit

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.070 
chance that it does I'm not gonna sit
here<00:05:57.849> and<00:05:58.000> be<00:05:58.090> upset<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.630> want<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.840> see<00:05:58.930> what
