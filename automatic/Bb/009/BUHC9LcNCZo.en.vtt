when<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.200> straighten<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.130> i<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.280> the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
when I straighten it and i think the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.610 
when I straighten it and i think the
straightening<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:09.900> gives<00:03:10.049> people<00:03:10.440> who

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
straightening is what gives people who

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.080 
straightening is what gives people who
you<00:03:10.739> straighten<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> ends<00:03:11.670> were<00:03:11.820> kind<00:03:12.030> of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you straighten in the ends were kind of

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.850 
you straighten in the ends were kind of
scruffy<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.870> could<00:03:13.079> amount<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> back<00:03:13.739> to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
scruffy you could amount and you back to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.990 
scruffy you could amount and you back to
where<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.040> started<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.579> i<00:03:14.640> don't<00:03:14.760> even<00:03:14.820> wear
