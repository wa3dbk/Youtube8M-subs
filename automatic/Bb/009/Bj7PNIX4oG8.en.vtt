animations<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.910> storm<00:00:18.480> Gamora<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.680> scarlet

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
animations for storm Gamora and scarlet

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.650 
animations for storm Gamora and scarlet
and<00:00:21.410> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.920> three<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> say<00:00:23.970> Gamora<00:00:24.210> is

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and of the three I have to say Gamora is

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
and of the three I have to say Gamora is
the<00:00:24.930> best<00:00:25.310> storm<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> Scarlet<00:00:27.090> are<00:00:27.180> just

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the best storm and Scarlet are just

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.859 
the best storm and Scarlet are just
horrible<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.890> always<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
horrible for me I always like to do a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
horrible for me I always like to do a
five-hit<00:00:31.380> combo<00:00:31.890> usually<00:00:32.430> medium<00:00:32.730> light

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
five-hit combo usually medium light

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.650 
five-hit combo usually medium light
light<00:00:34.050> light<00:00:34.620> medium<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:35.940> follow<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> up

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
light light medium and then follow it up

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.229 
light light medium and then follow it up
with<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.170> special<00:00:37.440> attack<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.399> just

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
with this special attack that just

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.020 
with this special attack that just
doesn't<00:00:39.600> work<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.500> storm<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> scarlet<00:00:41.820> -

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
doesn't work with storm and scarlet -

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110 
doesn't work with storm and scarlet -
well<00:00:42.239> especially<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> second<00:00:44.120> special

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
well especially the second special

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
well especially the second special
attack<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.200> works<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.739> fine<00:00:46.920> with

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
attack but it works just fine with

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.209 
attack but it works just fine with
Gamora<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> three<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
Gamora so of the three I think more is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.020 
Gamora so of the three I think more is
the<00:00:50.940> best<00:00:51.360> thing<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.320> about<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> three

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the best thing I like about the three

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
the best thing I like about the three
special<00:00:54.360> attacks<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.559> have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
special attacks is that they all have

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.260 
special attacks is that they all have
bleed<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.309> damage<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.940> they're<00:00:57.149> all

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
bleed to damage and they're all

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.869 
bleed to damage and they're all
identical<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.949> means<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
identical and what that means to me is I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.959 
identical and what that means to me is I
tend<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.140> first<00:01:01.859> special<00:01:02.370> attack<00:01:02.670> more

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
tend to use my first special attack more

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.369 
tend to use my first special attack more
often<00:01:03.359> than<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> normally<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.229> other

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
often than I normally would with other

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
often than I normally would with other
characters<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.970> bleed

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
characters because I like that bleed

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.710 
characters because I like that bleed
plus<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.200> love<00:01:07.470> watching<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.159> fall<00:01:08.970> down<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
plus I love watching them fall down and

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
plus I love watching them fall down and
flop<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> soccer<00:01:11.010> player<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.670> die

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
flop like a soccer player when they die

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.330 
flop like a soccer player when they die
from<00:01:12.780> bleed<00:01:13.170> damage<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.189> it's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
from bleed damage I just think that it's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
from bleed damage I just think that it's
so<00:01:14.549> funny<00:01:14.880> every<00:01:15.869> time<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> attack<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
so funny every time that you attack you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
so funny every time that you attack you
get<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> chance<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.360> increase<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.380> critical

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
get a chance to increase your critical

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.510 
get a chance to increase your critical
damage<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.619> one<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> things<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
damage and one of the things I like the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.539 
damage and one of the things I like the
best<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.210> Gamora<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.140> her<00:01:25.530> heavy<00:01:25.860> her<00:01:26.250> heavy

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
best about Gamora is her heavy her heavy

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
best about Gamora is her heavy her heavy
is<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.299> hit<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> got<00:01:28.200> boom<00:01:28.500> boom<00:01:28.710> boom

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
is for hit so you got boom boom boom

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.160 
is for hit so you got boom boom boom
that's<00:01:29.369> giving<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.360> increasing<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that's giving you that's increasing the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980 
that's giving you that's increasing the
opportunities<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:33.509> critical

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
opportunities of that that critical

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.380 
opportunities of that that critical
chance<00:01:34.259> buffer<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.640> there's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
chance buffer to go up there's a lot of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.200 
chance buffer to go up there's a lot of
confusion<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.950> ranks<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> levels<00:01:41.210> right

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
confusion on on ranks and levels right

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
confusion on on ranks and levels right
now<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.869> can't<00:01:43.170> rank<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.770> until<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.700> at

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
now you can't rank it until that's at

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.510 
now you can't rank it until that's at
max<00:01:45.210> level<00:01:47.899> okay<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.259> Gamora<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.009> max

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
max level okay so now Gamora is at max

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.389 
max level okay so now Gamora is at max
ten<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> ten<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.220> is
