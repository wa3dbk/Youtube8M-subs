 to set fire to the enemy needs 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.790
 such hammers for this we get up on the car 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 and aim at the edge of the antenna and let go of 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.000

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.910
 it will be pretty hard to go out 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.280
