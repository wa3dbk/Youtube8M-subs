suit
these<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.600> pay<00:01:54.840> grade<00:01:54.900> but

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.250 
I think I know a doctor that can help
you<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.400> pretty<00:01:59.580> much<00:01:59.730> plays<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.510> same<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260

you but it pretty much plays the same we
we<00:02:01.770> should<00:02:01.980> definitely<00:02:02.160> look<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> bottle

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
we should definitely look for a bottle

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.300 
we should definitely look for a bottle
and<00:02:05.660> most<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.810> his<00:02:06.930> webbing<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.620> black<00:02:08.009> other
