00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.900 
this rock structure here I have what I
think<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.690> red<00:00:58.050> bubble<00:00:58.440> algae<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.699> not

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
think is red bubble algae and I'm not

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.670 
think is red bubble algae and I'm not
sure<00:01:00.180> I've<00:01:00.449> looked<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.809> online<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.469> looks

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
sure I've looked it up online it looks

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.310 
sure I've looked it up online it looks
like<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.910> wanted<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
like that's what it is I just wanted to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
like that's what it is I just wanted to
have<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.350> people<00:01:04.769> comment<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.519> exactly

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
have some people comment and see exactly

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.210 
have some people comment and see exactly
if<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.540> what<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.220> if

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
if that would if that is what it is if

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.750 
if that would if that is what it is if
so<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.320> correct<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.280> i've<00:01:14.430> read<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so is it correct that what i've read is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.870 
so is it correct that what i've read is
you<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.009> try<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> pick<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.759> there

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you have to try to pick it out of there

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
you have to try to pick it out of there
and<00:01:18.030> suck<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.600> without<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.110> breaking<00:01:19.320> up

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and suck it out without it breaking up

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.969 
and suck it out without it breaking up
any<00:01:19.740> spores<00:01:20.210> I<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.229> over<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.590> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
any spores I have some more over here on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
any spores I have some more over here on
this<00:01:23.189> rock<00:01:23.630> its<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.350> near<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.840> near

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this rock its way back near that near

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.740 
this rock its way back near that near
the<00:01:27.990> Leafs<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:29.700> mean<00:01:30.150> those<00:01:30.329> things<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.720> like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the Leafs I mean those things look like

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.499 
the Leafs I mean those things look like
they're<00:01:30.990> ready<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> explode<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.299> one

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
they're ready to explode so that was one

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.800 
they're ready to explode so that was one
thing<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.780> had<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:35.540> another<00:01:36.540> thing<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
thing I had going on another thing is

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.740 
thing I had going on another thing is
the<00:01:37.140> snails<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.400> chomping<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the snails here they are chomping and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
the snails here they are chomping and
and<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.380> might<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.740> hard<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and this might be hard to see in the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
and this might be hard to see in the
light<00:01:41.579> they're<00:01:42.270> chopping<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> coraline

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
light they're chopping at the coraline

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
light they're chopping at the coraline
algae<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.009> some<00:01:44.250> other<00:01:44.430> coralline

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
algae and there's some other coralline

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.230 
algae and there's some other coralline
algae<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> sand<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.970> imagine

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
algae in the sand so I can imagine

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
algae in the sand so I can imagine
that's<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.439> spreading<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.070> at

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
that's going to be spreading here at

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
that's going to be spreading here at
some<00:01:50.430> point<00:01:50.570> because<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:51.810> grinding<00:01:52.110> away

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
some point because they're grinding away

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.910 
some point because they're grinding away
at<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.570> one<00:01:54.570> other<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.530> what

way<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.800> back<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.459> another<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:22.910> back

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
in there and on this side I thought

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.230 
in there and on this side I thought
there<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.180> some<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> can't<00:02:29.720> remember<00:02:29.930> where<00:02:30.260> um

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
there was some I can't remember where um

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.810 
there was some I can't remember where um
exactly<00:02:32.240> but<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.680> they're<00:02:34.160> everywhere<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.760> I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
exactly but so they're everywhere and I

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.910 
exactly but so they're everywhere and I
was<00:02:34.910> wondering<00:02:35.300> if<00:02:35.500> anything<00:02:36.500> should<00:02:36.739> i<00:02:36.860> do

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
was wondering if anything should i do

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.020 
was wondering if anything should i do
with<00:02:37.250> those<00:02:37.430> leave<00:02:38.390> them<00:02:38.540> alone<00:02:38.630> or<00:02:39.140> try<00:02:39.739> to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
with those leave them alone or try to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750 
with those leave them alone or try to
get<00:02:41.030> rid<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.270> them<00:02:41.980> one<00:02:42.980> thing<00:02:43.250> over<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:43.550> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
get rid of them one thing over here I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.240 
get rid of them one thing over here I
think<00:02:43.880> that's<00:02:44.540> an<00:02:44.780> orange<00:02:45.050> sponge<00:02:45.709> growing

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
think that's an orange sponge growing

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.370 
think that's an orange sponge growing
over<00:02:46.459> there<00:02:46.640> underneath<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.600> rock<00:02:47.900> I'm<00:02:48.140> not

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
over there underneath this rock I'm not

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.490 
over there underneath this rock I'm not
a<00:02:48.440> hundred<00:02:48.769> percent<00:02:48.980> sure<00:02:49.340> but<00:02:50.410> looks<00:02:51.410> like

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
a hundred percent sure but looks like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.590 
a hundred percent sure but looks like
that<00:02:51.709> might<00:02:51.890> be<00:02:51.950> some<00:02:52.220> type<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.430> sponge<00:02:52.850> that's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that might be some type of sponge that's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.670 
that might be some type of sponge that's
pretty<00:02:53.900> cool<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.980> last<00:02:55.190> thing<00:02:55.370> is<00:02:55.730> um<00:02:56.680> my

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
pretty cool so the last thing is um my

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.820 
pretty cool so the last thing is um my
sand<00:02:58.010> bed<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:59.060> snails<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.750> dug<00:03:00.260> up<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.590> sand

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
sand bed the snails have dug up the sand

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.350 
sand bed the snails have dug up the sand
bed<00:03:01.010> quite<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> bit<00:03:01.519> right<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.850> here<00:03:02.090> it's<00:03:02.209> not

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
bed quite a bit right in here it's not

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.949 
bed quite a bit right in here it's not
very<00:03:02.570> smooth<00:03:03.050> anymore<00:03:04.000> down<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.390> back<00:03:05.600> way

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
very smooth anymore down in the back way

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.170 
very smooth anymore down in the back way
back<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.440> there<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:07.250> dipped<00:03:07.580> down<00:03:07.790> quite<00:03:08.150> a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
back in there that's dipped down quite a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.590 
back in there that's dipped down quite a
bit<00:03:08.269> back<00:03:08.630> there<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.080> i<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.600> less

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
bit back there and i think it is less

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.479 
bit back there and i think it is less
than<00:03:11.870> four<00:03:12.170> inches<00:03:13.780> down<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.140> this<00:03:15.380> cave<00:03:16.070> over

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
than four inches down in this cave over

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.610 
than four inches down in this cave over
here<00:03:16.820> down<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:17.480> there<00:03:17.810> that's<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:18.320> think<00:03:18.350> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
here down in there that's I think a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.650 
here down in there that's I think a
little<00:03:18.739> less<00:03:18.950> than<00:03:18.980> four<00:03:19.370> inches<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.910> maybe

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
little less than four inches and maybe

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.630 
little less than four inches and maybe
then<00:03:20.810> get<00:03:20.959> down<00:03:21.140> here<00:03:21.350> see<00:03:21.530> how<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.070> this

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
then get down here see how that is this

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.490 
then get down here see how that is this
is<00:03:22.820> four<00:03:23.060> inches<00:03:23.209> two<00:03:23.600> here<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.079> two<00:03:24.280> here<00:03:25.280> um

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
is four inches two here and two here um

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.819 
is four inches two here and two here um
but<00:03:27.500> down<00:03:28.340> in<00:03:28.370> there<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:29.000> not<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:30.079> was
