under siege and they're under threat of
a<00:03:07.140> hiding<00:03:07.560> now<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.130> up<00:03:08.790> until<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.180> few

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
a hiding now and really up until a few

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.180 
a hiding now and really up until a few
minutes<00:03:09.930> ago<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.410> haven't<00:03:10.680> deserved<00:03:10.950> their

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
minutes ago they haven't deserved their

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.030 
minutes ago they haven't deserved their
40<00:03:11.880> 29<00:03:12.300> or<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.930> doesn't<00:03:13.170> feel<00:03:13.290> as<00:03:13.740> if<00:03:13.770> it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
40 29 or but it doesn't feel as if it

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.620 
40 29 or but it doesn't feel as if it
was<00:03:14.160> going<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.640> margin<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.360> first

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
was going to be that margin the first

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.000 
was going to be that margin the first
half<00:03:15.870> didn't<00:03:16.140> go<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.470> good<00:03:16.620> what<00:03:16.830> were<00:03:16.890> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
half didn't go so good what were the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.060 
half didn't go so good what were the
issues<00:03:17.100> there<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.840> think<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.020> didn't<00:03:19.980> play

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
issues there I think we didn't play

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.130 
issues there I think we didn't play
enough<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.400> actually<00:03:20.550> we<00:03:20.820> tried<00:03:21.210> to<00:03:21.300> play<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
enough to actually we tried to play the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.870 
enough to actually we tried to play the
match<00:03:22.320> rugby<00:03:22.500> picture<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.070> half<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.490> just<00:03:23.670> I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
match rugby picture in half and just I

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.810

wanted to you know him here as in

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.850 
wanted to you know him here as in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
you know it didn't allow us to get any

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.430 
you know it didn't allow us to get any
push<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.570> that's<00:03:31.080> what<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.260> talked<00:03:31.410> about

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
push on so that's what we talked about

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.650 
push on so that's what we talked about
at<00:03:31.620> halftime<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.490> was<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> hell<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.600> lot

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
at halftime and I was a hell of a lot

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.970 
at halftime and I was a hell of a lot
better<00:03:33.780> second<00:03:34.170> half<00:03:34.200> well<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.709> couldn't<00:03:34.890> have

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
better second half well it couldn't have

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.260 
better second half well it couldn't have
been<00:03:35.040> much<00:03:35.250> better<00:03:35.310> actually<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.970> kept<00:03:36.180> them

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
been much better actually you kept them

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.120 
been much better actually you kept them
scoreless<00:03:36.570> on<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.840> second<00:03:37.230> half<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.709> think<00:03:38.010> for

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
scoreless on the second half I think for

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.250 
scoreless on the second half I think for
about<00:03:38.280> 50<00:03:38.610> minutes<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> game<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:40.080> some

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
about 50 minutes of the game just some

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.600 
about 50 minutes of the game just some
wonderful<00:03:40.620> continuity<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.280> defence

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
wonderful continuity in the defence

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.790 
wonderful continuity in the defence
outstanding<00:03:42.270> yeah<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:43.170> that's<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:43.620> part

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
outstanding yeah that's that's one part

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.170 
outstanding yeah that's that's one part
of<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.010> game<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.340> had<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.610> pick<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.000> level

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
of the game we had to pick up a level

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.020 
of the game we had to pick up a level
from<00:03:45.390> last<00:03:45.570> week<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.620> know<00:03:46.740> in<00:03:47.000> well<00:03:48.000> i

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
from last week and you know in well i

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.400 
from last week and you know in well i
think<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:48.630> perhaps<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.080> was<00:03:49.170> because<00:03:49.200> we

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
think you know perhaps it was because we

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.570 
think you know perhaps it was because we
weren't<00:03:49.590> at<00:03:49.709> what<00:03:49.860> points<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.370> were<00:03:50.430> last

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
weren't at what points like we were last

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.400 
weren't at what points like we were last
week<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> boys<00:03:51.150> really<00:03:51.450> dug<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.080> had

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
week that the boys really dug in and had

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.140 
week that the boys really dug in and had
the<00:03:52.500> intensity<00:03:52.950> there<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.850> second

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
the intensity there and in the second

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.370 
the intensity there and in the second
half<00:03:54.300> our<00:03:54.540> defence<00:03:54.840> force<00:03:55.110> some<00:03:55.350> turnovers

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
half our defence force some turnovers

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.830 
half our defence force some turnovers
which<00:03:55.950> we<00:03:56.100> capitalized<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.730> some<00:03:57.480> new<00:03:57.630> players

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
which we capitalized on some new players

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.630 
which we capitalized on some new players
grew<00:03:58.140> another<00:03:58.380> leg<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.769> think<00:03:58.980> tonight<00:03:59.100> totally

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
grew another leg I think tonight totally

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.009 
grew another leg I think tonight totally
different<00:03:59.940> from<00:04:00.090> last<00:04:00.209> week<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.630> questions

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
different from last week the questions

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.930 
different from last week the questions
were<00:04:01.140> asked<00:04:01.440> yeah<00:04:01.950> they<00:04:02.130> were<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> guess<00:04:02.790> we

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
were asked yeah they were I guess we

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.270 
were asked yeah they were I guess we
realized<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:04.320> know<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.980> last<00:04:05.160> few

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
realized that you know the last few

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.590 
realized that you know the last few
years<00:04:05.370> against<00:04:05.730> Wales<00:04:05.970> I've<00:04:06.239> always<00:04:06.360> been<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
years against Wales I've always been a

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.300 
years against Wales I've always been a
physical<00:04:06.750> pack<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> they<00:04:07.980> come<00:04:08.160> with<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
physical pack and they come with the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.370 
physical pack and they come with the
attitude<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.790> play<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.330> they<00:04:09.510> put<00:04:10.140> some<00:04:10.260> heat

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
attitude to play so they put some heat

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.830 
attitude to play so they put some heat
on<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.430> thought<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.239> know<00:04:12.330> every

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
on but you know I thought you know every
