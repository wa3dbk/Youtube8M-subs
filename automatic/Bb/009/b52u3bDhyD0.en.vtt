00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 this is a drone phantom 2 is a drone 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.580
 who has a good relationship 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.430
 Quality-price is suitable for both use 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 domestic as for professional use and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.090
 Well, it's a little bit, then, like, 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.910
 we see has four rotors is a rum of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 four propellers here has the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.970
 battery and inside it has the plate that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.360
 has a series of accessories that are 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.000
 then the gps to be able to locate the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 compass in order to have stability and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 so that it does not move so much with the wind 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.500
 and well then below because it has a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 to hook what is the support 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.110
 typical of the camera that usually 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 mounts a go pro camera to be able to 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.480
 record the shots can take all three 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.399
 models that there are of camera go pro what 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 happens is that the black is recommended 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.759
 edition that is the one that has more 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.789
 definition because it is capable of recording in 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.430
 4k and is the one that records the most videos 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.340
 sharper is a pretty drone 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.900
 versatile specifically this one I have seen 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.240
 videos that got it even 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.190
 a volcano where was some of the lava 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 splashing and were able to bring it closer 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.950
 pretty much that is a drone that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.230
 it is quite weather resistant but not 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.690
 it stops being an intermediate drone on 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.060
 approximate price of this then round the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.330
 700 euros depending on the accessories 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.430
 with what the mountains and yet the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 professionals since they start from two thousand 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.360
 five hundred euros and accessories 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.240
 they are much higher, so a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.420
 professional drone mounted as round the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 four or five thousand euros this drone 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 has 25 minutes of maximum autonomy with 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.220
 the standard battery that mounts there is a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.240
 new model that they have taken out that has 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.540
 some more autonomy 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.899
 and you can get away from the command signal 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.549
 default 300 meters and depending on 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.470
 the accessories that are assembled then 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.140
 can move up to one kilometer later 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 It also includes the gps function that you 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.470
 from the computer you can program it 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.970
 so that it goes following a route and in 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.890
 that case, yes, you can take it away 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.340
 something more of the command with which you are 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 driving good this is the command with the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.180
 that the phantom is handled and good for 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.310
 go up then this lever is used that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.970
 is what makes it take off in mode 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.820
 vertical 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.740
 and then if you leave it static it stays 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.410
 static and to descend then low 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.850
 down and then 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.650
 with this it turns to the sides and with this 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.530
 because you tilt it and it tilts it towards 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.540
 avante to move it in plan 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.610
 longitudinal and good 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.250
 is the functions that it has then apart 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.969
 have here to change the function 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.030
 gps to function to you and that function to 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.159
 types is with which you drive the command and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.769
 the gps function is the one that is capable 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.390
 to make the drone land just in 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.390
 the point at which he has taken off
