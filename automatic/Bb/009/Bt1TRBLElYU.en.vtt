00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.799
 what would you do if your world was 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.320
 one on the other second 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.509
 suddenly would have changed completely 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.630

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:27.230
 croft wants to get out of this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:31.980
 nightmare of death and destruction like that 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.489
 humanly so vulnerable and so real 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.710
 we have never seen her 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.920
 uncertain and desperate, she seeks one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 way out far from this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 cruel place full of fear and death 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840
 but her way is no easy and that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.140
 are coming, you seem to come 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.100
 impossible this time she needs everything 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.219
 your powers 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.559
 all your willpower for the task 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.070
 that lies before her 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 square enix and crystal dynamics 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 present you tomb raider yes here 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.360
 becomes the story of lara croft 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.790
 tells how it all started 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 what had to happen with this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.310
 vulnerable little innocent girl 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.759
 to the grave robber was she 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.189
 later, yes, she is stranded after 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.490
 a terrible plane crash 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.450
 a not so lonely island on 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 yes their locals something 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.409
 are more aggressive than normal and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.579
 Of course, desperately looking for help 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 and rescue 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.689
 It is not only from the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.420
 locals attacked but also 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.720
 from the flora and fauna of the island itself 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.090
 but who can our young lara croft 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.189
 actually she can trust her 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.930
 really trust or allies 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.100
 maybe they just want that too 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.490
 to dupe 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.290
 you do not know but give up is for 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.719
 she no alternative 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 and so she tries with arrow and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.530
 not only turned against the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.099
 native but also against others 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.280
 defend rather darkly 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 while one is aware of her gentle 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.700
 and good-natured nature you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.400
 always tries to be present 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.250
 she has to keep it because of that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.709
 opponents want only one death 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.140
 and so she has to become a hunter 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.900
 We have got to know and love each other 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.680
 she has to kill she has to defend herself 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 and she has to be her in this situation 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.879
 you must protect yourself 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.180
 I had to preserve humanity 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.670
 preserve and have to try others 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.459
 to keep people from her and hers 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.280
 inflict harm on friends what happens 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.400
 when the huntress suddenly hunted down 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.560
 will and is your new piece since 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.870
 we have to bend it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.209
 we will survive with her 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.590
 or will we be miserable to ours 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.099
 task fail 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.200
 that and much more you see from the 5 3 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.629
 on my channel 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.959
 I look forward to seeing you when it says 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.959
 let's play tomb raider until then
