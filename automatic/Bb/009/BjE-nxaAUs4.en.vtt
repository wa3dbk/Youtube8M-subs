00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
round flowers in spring are the reason

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.019 
round flowers in spring are the reason
for<00:00:18.810> its<00:00:19.109> popularity<00:00:19.189> much<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> hydrangea

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
for its popularity much like a hydrangea

for its popularity much like a hydrangea
flower<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.779> ways<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.800> very<00:00:23.369> showy<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.840> this

flower in ways but very showy now this
one<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.710> showing<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:27.109> wanted

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
one that I'm showing you here I wanted

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
one that I'm showing you here I wanted
to<00:00:28.170> show<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:28.939> this<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.119> probably<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
to show this because this is probably a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.889 
to show this because this is probably a
30<00:00:30.869> 40<00:00:31.800> year-old<00:00:32.250> plant<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:33.149> been<00:00:33.300> totally

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
30 40 year-old plant that's been totally

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
30 40 year-old plant that's been totally
left<00:00:34.350> alone<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.610> side<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.880> somebody's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
left alone on the side of somebody's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
left alone on the side of somebody's
property<00:00:36.840> I'm<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.770> Northern<00:00:38.190> California

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
property I'm here in Northern California

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.350 
property I'm here in Northern California
in<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> hot<00:00:39.570> inland<00:00:40.020> valley<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:41.670> always

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
in a hot inland valley and I always

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.260 
in a hot inland valley and I always
think<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.899> interesting<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.680> say<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
think it's interesting to say see with a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810 
think it's interesting to say see with a
plant<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.140> totally<00:00:46.620> left<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.070> alone<00:00:47.309> how

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
plant if we totally left this alone how

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.060 
plant if we totally left this alone how
would<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.059> behave<00:00:48.539> well<00:00:49.200> here's<00:00:49.440> our<00:00:49.620> answer

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
would it behave well here's our answer

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
would it behave well here's our answer
so<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.110> about<00:00:52.110> 15<00:00:53.070> feet<00:00:53.399> tall<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.239> wide

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so this is about 15 feet tall and wide

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
so this is about 15 feet tall and wide
and<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> look<00:00:58.199> gangly<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.100> sure

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and it's going to look gangly for sure

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.119 
and it's going to look gangly for sure
but<00:01:00.090> look<00:01:00.420> how<00:01:00.600> much<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.350> flowering<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
but look how much it's flowering and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
but look how much it's flowering and
here's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> close-up<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> flowers<00:01:04.019> those

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
here's a close-up of the flowers those

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.969 
here's a close-up of the flowers those
are<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.880> three<00:01:06.290> probably<00:01:07.290> three<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> four

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
are about three probably three to four

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
are about three probably three to four
inch<00:01:08.130> diameter<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.450> there's<00:01:09.930> sterile

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
inch diameter by the way there's sterile

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
inch diameter by the way there's sterile
flowers<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> seed<00:01:12.510> there's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
flowers so they don't go to seed there's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.940 
flowers so they don't go to seed there's
no<00:01:12.990> issues<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.570> born<00:01:16.049> this

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
no issues there and they are born this

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.120 
no issues there and they are born this
was<00:01:17.130> taken<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> mid<00:01:18.240> April<00:01:18.740> 2015

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
was taken in mid April 2015

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760 
was taken in mid April 2015
so<00:01:20.490> they<00:01:20.729> come<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.180> spring<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so they come on in spring and then the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
so they come on in spring and then the
leaves<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.720> time

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
leaves start to come on at the same time

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.890 
leaves start to come on at the same time
the<00:01:25.200> flowers<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.119> flowers<00:01:27.659> are

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the flowers are are on the flowers are

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.069 
the flowers are are on the flowers are
nice<00:01:28.140> they're<00:01:28.439> pretty<00:01:28.650> long-lived<00:01:30.079> I've

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
nice they're pretty long-lived I've

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.560 
nice they're pretty long-lived I've
noticed<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.280> seen<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.610> last<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
noticed that they seen the last three to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.190 
noticed that they seen the last three to
five<00:01:33.780> weeks<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.470> say<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:36.270> read<00:01:36.960> that

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
five weeks I would say and I read that

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100 
five weeks I would say and I read that
these<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.650> actually<00:01:38.210> bloom<00:01:39.210> during<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
these can actually bloom during the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
these can actually bloom during the
summer<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.710> although<00:01:41.670> I've<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.450> really

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
summer as well although I've not really

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.789 
summer as well although I've not really
witnessed<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.259> myself<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.470> consider<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
witnessed that myself so I consider this

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
witnessed that myself so I consider this
in<00:01:47.130> design<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:48.770> specimen<00:01:49.770> shrub<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:51.509> used

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
in design a specimen shrub and I used

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.760 
in design a specimen shrub and I used
those<00:01:52.369> sparingly<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.180> landscape<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
those sparingly in the landscape in a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.450 
those sparingly in the landscape in a
design<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.409> was<00:01:58.530> ever<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.860> plant<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
design but if there was ever a plant to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
design but if there was ever a plant to
kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.850> celebrate<00:02:00.450> spring<00:02:00.990> coming<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.649> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
kind of celebrate spring coming on this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.399 
kind of celebrate spring coming on this
is<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.850> quite<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> show<00:02:03.659> these<00:02:04.229> are

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
is the one it's quite a show these are

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.960 
is the one it's quite a show these are
also<00:02:04.560> great<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.280> cut<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> bring<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> house

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
also great to cut and bring in the house

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
also great to cut and bring in the house
so<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> other<00:02:09.300> thing<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> note<00:02:10.110> here<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.470> we

so the other thing to note here is we

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.960 
so the other thing to note here is we
have<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.760> low<00:02:12.030> humidity

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
have very low humidity

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.200 
have very low humidity
and<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> summer<00:02:14.320> it's<00:02:14.620> below<00:02:14.980> 20%<00:02:15.460> and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
and in the summer it's below 20% and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.170 
and in the summer it's below 20% and
this<00:02:16.990> plant<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.620> surviving<00:02:18.610> with<00:02:18.790> no

this plant is surviving with no
irrigation<00:02:19.950> whatsoever<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.160> we<00:02:21.310> don't<00:02:21.490> get

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
irrigation whatsoever and we don't get

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.870 
irrigation whatsoever and we don't get
any<00:02:21.970> rain<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.660> six<00:02:23.080> months<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:23.620> more<00:02:23.880> between

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
any rain for six months or more between

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.350 
any rain for six months or more between
May<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.620> October<00:02:26.760> generally<00:02:27.760> here<00:02:28.030> where<00:02:28.210> we

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
May and October generally here where we

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.050 
May and October generally here where we
are<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.900> what's<00:02:29.620> impressive<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.520> me<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.730> hat

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
are so what's impressive to me is hat

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.670 
are so what's impressive to me is hat
and<00:02:31.270> we're<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.750> midst<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.230> our<00:02:32.410> worst

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and we're in the midst of our worst

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.970 
and we're in the midst of our worst
drought<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.130> history<00:02:33.660> fourth<00:02:34.660> year<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.440> very

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
drought in history fourth year of very

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.830 
drought in history fourth year of very
intense<00:02:36.430> droughts<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:36.850> high<00:02:37.180> temperatures

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
intense droughts and high temperatures

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.440 
intense droughts and high temperatures
and<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.620> plant<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.220> surviving<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.210> of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and so this plant is surviving all of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020 
and so this plant is surviving all of
that<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.740> would<00:02:41.980> never<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.460> pegged<00:02:42.760> this

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
that so I would never have pegged this

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.020 
that so I would never have pegged this
for<00:02:43.390> a<00:02:43.420> drought<00:02:44.230> resistant<00:02:44.920> shrub<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.700> there

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
for a drought resistant shrub but there

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.210 
for a drought resistant shrub but there
you<00:02:46.209> go<00:02:46.240> it's<00:02:46.780> doing<00:02:47.230> what<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.530> needs<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you go it's doing what it needs to to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.000 
you go it's doing what it needs to to
get<00:02:48.370> by<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.910> actually<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.450> looks<00:02:49.480> quite<00:02:50.010> quite

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
get by and actually it looks quite quite

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.750 
get by and actually it looks quite quite
nice<00:02:51.300> now<00:02:52.300> if<00:02:53.290> you're<00:02:53.680> using<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.580> design

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
nice now if you're using this in design

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.030 
nice now if you're using this in design
you<00:02:55.240> can<00:02:55.420> certainly<00:02:55.690> keep<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.320> smaller<00:02:56.740> than

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
you can certainly keep it smaller than

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.310 
you can certainly keep it smaller than
this<00:02:57.280> most<00:02:57.640> people<00:02:57.850> do<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:58.600> picture<00:02:59.080> you're

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
this most people do this picture you're

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.770 
this most people do this picture you're
about<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.770> see<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:01.209> somebody's

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
about to see here is in somebody's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.870 
about to see here is in somebody's
garden<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.440> my<00:03:02.470> area<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.160> that's<00:03:03.280> about<00:03:03.670> eight

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
garden in my area and that's about eight

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.560 
garden in my area and that's about eight
feet<00:03:04.150> wide<00:03:04.209> by<00:03:04.930> six<00:03:05.260> feet<00:03:05.440> tall<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.209> very<00:03:07.209> easy

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
feet wide by six feet tall and very easy

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.040 
feet wide by six feet tall and very easy
because<00:03:07.959> it's<00:03:08.320> deciduous<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:10.240> maintain

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
because it's deciduous that to maintain

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.490 
because it's deciduous that to maintain
a<00:03:11.410> size<00:03:11.860> more<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.120> I'd<00:03:13.330> say<00:03:13.690> five

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
a size more like this so I'd say five

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.000 
a size more like this so I'd say five
feet<00:03:14.830> diameter<00:03:15.240> minimum<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.680> let<00:03:17.860> it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
feet diameter minimum to really let it

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.870 
feet diameter minimum to really let it
look<00:03:18.220> okay

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
look okay

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.170 
look okay
and<00:03:19.320> probably<00:03:20.320> six<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.040> eight<00:03:21.190> feet<00:03:21.519> tall<00:03:21.880> and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
and probably six to eight feet tall and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.570 
and probably six to eight feet tall and
wide<00:03:22.390> would<00:03:22.840> be<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.050> reasonable<00:03:23.800> size<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.370> keep

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
wide would be a reasonable size to keep

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.330 
wide would be a reasonable size to keep
these<00:03:26.340> tolerant<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.430> different<00:03:28.000> soils<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
these tolerant of different soils and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.340 
these tolerant of different soils and
also<00:03:30.340> note<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.760> these<00:03:31.209> are<00:03:31.269> not<00:03:31.480> being<00:03:31.900> fed

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
also note that these are not being fed

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.530 
also note that these are not being fed
the<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:33.070> larger<00:03:33.610> one<00:03:33.940> that<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.300> saw

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
the one this larger one that you saw

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.890 
the one this larger one that you saw
here<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:36.010> doesn't<00:03:36.910> take<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> lot<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> care

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
here so just doesn't take a lot of care

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.140 
here so just doesn't take a lot of care
the<00:03:38.739> book<00:03:38.950> says<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.310> they're<00:03:39.700> susceptible

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
the book says that they're susceptible

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.070 
the book says that they're susceptible
to<00:03:40.570> aphids<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:42.000> haven't<00:03:43.000> really<00:03:43.239> seen<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.810> but

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
to aphids I haven't really seen that but

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.110 
to aphids I haven't really seen that but
I<00:03:44.110> haven't<00:03:44.350> grown<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.130> my<00:03:45.280> own<00:03:45.400> garden<00:03:45.670> so

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
I haven't grown this in my own garden so

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.930 
I haven't grown this in my own garden so
if<00:03:46.269> they<00:03:46.450> are<00:03:46.600> susceptible<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.380> aphids

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
if they are susceptible to aphids

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.400 
if they are susceptible to aphids
usually<00:03:48.940> Springs<00:03:49.360> when<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:50.019> them<00:03:50.140> badly

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
usually Springs when we get them badly

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.550 
usually Springs when we get them badly
in<00:03:50.739> our<00:03:50.890> area<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.549> these<00:03:52.209> had<00:03:52.630> none<00:03:52.989> on<00:03:53.230> them

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
in our area and these had none on them

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.400 
in our area and these had none on them
so<00:03:53.980> I'm<00:03:54.730> not<00:03:54.790> sure<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.480> that's<00:03:55.660> more<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.260> a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
so I'm not sure if that's more of a

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.100 
so I'm not sure if that's more of a
climate<00:03:57.280> zone<00:03:57.730> thing<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.450> whether<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:58.900> get

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
climate zone thing that whether you get

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.050 
climate zone thing that whether you get
that<00:03:59.320> more<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.680> an<00:03:59.799> issue<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.340> haven't<00:04:00.700> seen

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
that more of an issue but I haven't seen

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.600 
that more of an issue but I haven't seen
that<00:04:01.239> happening<00:04:01.780> these<00:04:02.440> grow<00:04:02.709> best<00:04:03.070> in<00:04:03.310> full

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
that happening these grow best in full

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.520 
that happening these grow best in full
Sun<00:04:03.670> but<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.360> have<00:04:04.660> seen<00:04:04.959> them<00:04:05.170> as<00:04:05.350> an

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
Sun but I have seen them as an

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.280 
Sun but I have seen them as an
understory<00:04:06.220> shrub<00:04:06.760> where<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.630> canopy<00:04:08.170> was

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
understory shrub where the canopy was

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.460 
understory shrub where the canopy was
fairly<00:04:08.739> high<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.459> full<00:04:09.820> Sun<00:04:10.090> generally<00:04:10.750> even

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
fairly high so full Sun generally even

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.670 
fairly high so full Sun generally even
in<00:04:11.620> hot<00:04:11.890> inland<00:04:12.340> areas<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.680> these

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
in hot inland areas like I have these

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.580 
in hot inland areas like I have these
are<00:04:14.920> hard<00:04:15.190> you<00:04:15.280> down<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.940> minus<00:04:16.510> 30<00:04:16.840> degrees<00:04:17.320> or

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
are hard you down to minus 30 degrees or

are hard you down to minus 30 degrees or
so<00:04:17.859> Fahrenheit<00:04:18.640> so<00:04:19.140> able<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.260> use<00:04:20.470> those<00:04:20.680> just

so Fahrenheit so able to use those just

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.020 
so Fahrenheit so able to use those just
about<00:04:21.400> anywhere<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:23.460> also<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.669> get<00:04:24.820> some

about anywhere and also can get some
