00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:53.510 

you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.979 

this<00:00:54.520> border<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.120> lot<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:56.430> development<00:00:57.430> with

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this border of a lot of development with

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500 
this border of a lot of development with
rise<00:00:58.989> my<00:00:59.320> struck<00:00:59.620> so<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.580> never<00:01:00.850> seen<00:01:01.120> before

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
rise my struck so that never seen before

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.340 
rise my struck so that never seen before
in<00:01:01.630> any<00:01:02.020> boards<00:01:02.380> also<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.540> bat<00:01:04.540> wings<00:01:04.780> who

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
in any boards also the bat wings who

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.610 
in any boards also the bat wings who
helped<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.979> lot<00:01:06.130> so<00:01:06.340> for<00:01:06.580> non<00:01:07.540> putting<00:01:07.870> on<00:01:08.050> a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
helped a lot so for non putting on a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.440 
helped a lot so for non putting on a
planing<00:01:09.490> condition<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:11.250> yes<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:12.580> five<00:01:13.240> years

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
planing condition so yes is five years

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.790 
planing condition so yes is five years
development<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.430> row<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.619> lot<00:01:17.770> of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
development in a row so it's a lot of

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.700 
development in a row so it's a lot of
rock<00:01:18.100> but<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.729> think<00:01:19.119> it's<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.330> good<00:01:19.479> success<00:01:19.840> we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
rock but I think it's a good success we

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.150 
rock but I think it's a good success we
will<00:01:20.830> talk<00:01:21.100> about<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:22.150> non<00:01:23.140> planing<00:01:23.590> future

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
will talk about the non planing future

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.570 
will talk about the non planing future
that<00:01:25.119> means<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.540> first<00:01:25.720> one<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:27.220> can<00:01:27.399> see

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
that means the first one is you can see

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.150 
that means the first one is you can see
here<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.899> mouse<00:01:29.080> right<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.560> right

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
here that the mouse right is right

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.469 
here that the mouse right is right
right<00:01:30.430> up<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:32.820> principle<00:01:33.820> effect<00:01:34.300> this

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
right up on the principle effect this

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.800 
right up on the principle effect this
half<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.020> that<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:36.119> increased<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.300> couple<00:01:37.690> of

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
half is that it's increased a couple of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.200 
half is that it's increased a couple of
rotation<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:38.979> basically<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.550> get<00:01:39.759> on<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
rotation so basically you get on the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.940 
rotation so basically you get on the
rail<00:01:40.390> more<00:01:40.660> quickly<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.470> stay<00:01:41.710> more

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
rail more quickly and you stay more

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.680 
rail more quickly and you stay more
longer<00:01:42.280> also<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:44.530> another<00:01:45.360> aspect<00:01:46.360> for<00:01:46.570> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
longer also for another aspect for the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.749 
longer also for another aspect for the
non<00:01:47.110> painting<00:01:47.410> venetian<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.550> dagger

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
non painting venetian is the dagger

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.080 
non painting venetian is the dagger
board<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.509> dagger<00:01:49.690> board<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.399> 78<00:01:51.399> degree<00:01:51.940> but

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
board the dagger board is 78 degree but

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.320 
board the dagger board is 78 degree but
with<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.690> soft<00:01:53.229> tip<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:54.640> work<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.970> little<00:01:55.060> bit

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
with a soft tip will work a little bit

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.779 
with a soft tip will work a little bit
like<00:01:55.509> a<00:01:55.539> formula<00:01:56.170> fin<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.160> know<00:01:57.369> formula

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
like a formula fin so you know formula

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.419 
like a formula fin so you know formula
fin<00:01:58.030> give<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.360> lot<00:01:58.569> of<00:01:58.690> lift<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.830> this<00:02:00.130> also

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
fin give a lot of lift so this also

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.059 
fin give a lot of lift so this also
helped<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.330> make<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.050> board<00:02:02.229> more<00:02:02.560> quickly<00:02:02.830> on

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
helped to make the board more quickly on

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.730 
helped to make the board more quickly on
the<00:02:03.280> rail<00:02:03.459> and<00:02:03.670> stay<00:02:04.240> longer<00:02:04.479> because<00:02:05.349> you<00:02:05.590> get

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
the rail and stay longer because you get

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
the rail and stay longer because you get
more<00:02:05.950> lift

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
more lift

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.710 
more lift
the<00:02:08.110> last<00:02:08.319> one<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.770> lots<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.459> facts<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.539> a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
the last one is lots of facts that is a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.490 
the last one is lots of facts that is a
deck<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.730> narrow<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.390> narrow<00:02:13.660> into<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
deck get more narrow and narrow into the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.110 
deck get more narrow and narrow into the
tail<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> bat<00:02:16.690> wings<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.670> direct

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
tail with the bat wings so the direct

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
tail with the bat wings so the direct
effect<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.569> this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.860> water<00:02:21.420> follow

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
effect of this is that the water follow

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.760 
effect of this is that the water follow
more<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.560> deck<00:02:24.000> than<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.420> bat<00:02:25.900> wings<00:02:26.110> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
more the deck than this bat wings so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670 
more the deck than this bat wings so
follow<00:02:27.310> more<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.940> deck<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> nice

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
follow more the deck so you have a nice

00:02:29.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
follow more the deck so you have a nice
exit<00:02:30.580> water<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.510> less<00:02:31.989> drugs<00:02:32.349> more<00:02:32.890> speed

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.640 

not<00:03:58.700> only<00:03:59.030> youth<00:03:59.210> but<00:03:59.690> also<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.200> rest<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.530> the

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
not only youth but also the rest of the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.340 
not only youth but also the rest of the
fleet<00:04:00.890> could<00:04:01.490> enjoy<00:04:02.000> only<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.930> light<00:04:03.140> wind

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
fleet could enjoy only the light wind

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.430 
fleet could enjoy only the light wind
features<00:04:03.800> of<00:04:03.980> their<00:04:04.160> equipment

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
features of their equipment

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.150 
features of their equipment
unfortunately<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.590> race<00:04:06.710> committee

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
unfortunately the race committee

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.890 
unfortunately the race committee
couldn't<00:04:07.340> organize<00:04:07.640> more<00:04:08.240> than<00:04:08.450> one<00:04:08.690> race

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
couldn't organize more than one race

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.830 
couldn't organize more than one race
today<00:04:09.140> so<00:04:09.320> we<00:04:10.160> keep<00:04:10.370> our<00:04:10.550> fingers<00:04:11.150> crossed<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
today so we keep our fingers crossed and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.660 
today so we keep our fingers crossed and
we<00:04:11.960> hope<00:04:12.140> there<00:04:12.500> will<00:04:12.590> be<00:04:12.650> more<00:04:12.980> wind<00:04:13.250> coming

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
we hope there will be more wind coming

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.790 
we hope there will be more wind coming
tomorrow
