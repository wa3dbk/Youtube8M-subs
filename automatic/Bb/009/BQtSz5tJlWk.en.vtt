00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.540
 In this tutorial I show you how 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:15.550
 her with magix video deluxe animation 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:17.560
 You can create a job for this 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.570
 we have a camera attached to the pc 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.650
 connected or one 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.659
 digital camera we become a camera 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.310
 have the connected to the pc 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:35.110
 Let's go this recording as well 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:36.580
 then symbolize on single picture and in 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.590
 already can come this year 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.810
 we choose our camera 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.840
 I still have a webcam on the pc 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.030
 then we can connect 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.470
 select filename for the images 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.670
 the pictures become easy 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.440
 numbered the location 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.950
 We also choose, I leave it 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.420
 here at the standard values 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.180
 We still have the opportunity here 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.290
 to adjust the picture quality 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 I have the best now 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.730
 quality made camera noise 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.409
 I would like to start recording now 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.980
 every time I took it 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.780
 he pushes a noise I come 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130
 I just took two figures now 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 with which I have a short 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.760
 would like to create animated film 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.740
 I press the recording button once 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.150
 Magix automatically makes a picture that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.280
 we can also use the file number 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.580
 see the next picture would have the number 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.580
 two 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.310
 Now I have the characters a whole 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.190
 Move wee bit 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.400
 but that should only be minimal 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.400
 his 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.090
 and I press the record button again 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.830
 I'm going to keep on doing that now and again 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.280
 the figures are always just a small one 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.830
 move pieces or something to the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.670
 change figures and neither the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.670
 Press the record button 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.239
 the procedure would have to be quite a few now 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
 I'll do it all a little bit 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.970
 I always have a few buttons 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 pictures prepared 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.610
 Now magix would like the pictures up here 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.070
 Right now we suggest and we can 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.270
 to import us 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.820
 these are the four pictures of 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.860
 aborted recording I change 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.810
 to the pictures already prepared 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.580
 have 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.970
 the pictures taken all one 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.160
 We have all change 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.000
 Here is a storyboard and pull us this 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 just down 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.820
 These will now be in order 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.290
 the default display duration is displayed 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.430
 now, however, still 7 seconds that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.700
 feldmann we by down here on 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.310
 the indication on it a blade and me 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.510
 would now have a display duration of three 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.130
 frames and click apply to all 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.820
 Thus, the ad will be about it for each 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.990
 picture set to three frames and so 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.060
 we already have a short one 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.300
 I'll give you another animated film 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.300
 demonstrate 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.130
 who has no webcam or digital camera 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.130
 you can decide on the pc can 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.230
 a normal digital camera take up 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.780
 a solid underground or best 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.110
 put a tripod and with the camera 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.760
 each individual pictures make like her 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.810
 It's not that hard 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.100
 to create short animated films 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.930
 if you liked the video 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.750
 do not forget to rate positively 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.730
 and for little more videos from me too 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.120
 miss you subscribed at the best times 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.120
 a canal
