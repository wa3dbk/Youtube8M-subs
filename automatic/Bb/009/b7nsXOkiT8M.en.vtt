in the IDI program believe that that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.340 
in the IDI program believe that that
integration<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.119> theory<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.540> practice<00:01:39.659> is

integration of theory and practice is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469 
integration of theory and practice is
best<00:01:40.650> achieved<00:01:40.829> by<00:01:41.759> working<00:01:42.060> with

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
best achieved by working with

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
best achieved by working with
professionals<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> field<00:01:44.159> but

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
professionals that are in the field but

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
professionals that are in the field but
then<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.149> goes<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> reliability<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> feel

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
then that goes to reliability so I feel

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
then that goes to reliability so I feel
like<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.850> an<00:01:47.970> ongoing<00:01:48.210> constant<00:01:49.140> dialogue

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
like it's an ongoing constant dialogue

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.010 
like it's an ongoing constant dialogue
it's<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.100> one-way<00:01:50.939> learning<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.659> we're

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's not one-way learning I think we're

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's not one-way learning I think we're
all<00:01:52.170> learning<00:01:52.409> together

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
all learning together

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.780 
all learning together
the<00:01:55.640> cohort<00:01:56.090> model<00:01:56.120> has<00:01:56.720> been<00:01:56.960> phenomenal

the cohort model has been phenomenal
probably<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> richest<00:01:59.420> part<00:01:59.780> of<00:01:59.900> this

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050

experience has been going through it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
experience has been going through it
with<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.810> group<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.409> equally<00:02:04.369> committed

successful<00:04:23.290> school<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:24.130> capstone<00:04:24.900> what<00:04:25.900> gave

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
successful school the capstone what gave

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.060 
successful school the capstone what gave
us<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.470> opportunity<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.980> identify

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
us the opportunity to identify

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.370 
us the opportunity to identify
real-world<00:04:27.970> problems<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:28.780> we<00:04:28.900> would<00:04:29.080> be

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
real-world problems that we would be

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.830 
real-world problems that we would be
interested<00:04:29.650> in<00:04:29.980> researching<00:04:30.730> when<00:04:31.419> we<00:04:31.600> talked

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
interested in researching when we talked

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.390 
interested in researching when we talked
to<00:04:31.960> students<00:04:32.350> we<00:04:32.620> talked<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.919> faculty<00:04:33.130> and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
to students we talked to faculty and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.150 
to students we talked to faculty and
staff<00:04:33.640> we<00:04:34.080> ran<00:04:35.080> whole<00:04:35.290> data<00:04:35.560> analysis<00:04:36.010> to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
staff we ran whole data analysis to

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.980 
staff we ran whole data analysis to
understand<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.910> problem<00:04:37.210> we<00:04:37.419> looked<00:04:37.870> at

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
understand the problem we looked at

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.620 
understand the problem we looked at
survey<00:04:38.470> results<00:04:39.030> based<00:04:40.030> off<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> teacher

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
survey results based off a teacher

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.260 
survey results based off a teacher
feedback<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.440> selected<00:04:41.980> schools<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.669> then<00:04:43.150> we

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
feedback in selected schools and then we

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.450 
feedback in selected schools and then we
also<00:04:43.450> went<00:04:43.780> to<00:04:43.930> visit<00:04:44.140> the<00:04:44.380> schools<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.130> I

also went to visit the schools and I

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.390 
also went to visit the schools and I
think<00:04:45.729> that<00:04:46.060> one<00:04:47.020> makes<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.740> as<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.950> doctoral

department<00:04:56.729> with<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.760> real<00:04:58.210> problem<00:04:59.020> that

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
department with a real problem that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.870 
department with a real problem that
could<00:04:59.410> be<00:04:59.530> applicable<00:04:59.890> anywhere<00:05:00.669> in<00:05:00.790> the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
program was this capstone we got a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.270 
program was this capstone we got a
chance<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.350> actually<00:05:05.530> put<00:05:05.979> into<00:05:06.190> practice

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
chance to actually put into practice

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.080 
chance to actually put into practice
what<00:05:06.760> we're<00:05:06.880> learning<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.870> classroom<00:05:08.380> and

what we're learning in the classroom and

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.130 
what we're learning in the classroom and
there<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.270> great<00:05:10.630> deal<00:05:10.870> of<00:05:10.990> satisfaction

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
there is a great deal of satisfaction

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.190 
there is a great deal of satisfaction
knowing<00:05:12.010> that<00:05:12.610> ma<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.210> final<00:05:13.539> product<00:05:13.960> of

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
knowing that ma the final product of

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.480 
knowing that ma the final product of
this<00:05:14.320> capstone<00:05:14.680> experience<00:05:15.100> isn't<00:05:15.310> going<00:05:15.430> to

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
this capstone experience isn't going to

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.640 
this capstone experience isn't going to
sit<00:05:15.940> on<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.060> shelf<00:05:16.390> somewhere<00:05:16.450> it's<00:05:17.320> going<00:05:17.590> to

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
sit on a shelf somewhere it's going to

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.830 
sit on a shelf somewhere it's going to
be<00:05:17.800> has<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.550> potential<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:19.090> really<00:05:19.300> make<00:05:19.630> a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
be has the potential to really make a

so<00:05:27.510> how<00:05:27.720> does<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.080> argument<00:05:28.650> resonate<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
so how does that argument resonate to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.700 
so how does that argument resonate to
you<00:05:29.729> tonight<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> classroom<00:05:30.570> experience<00:05:30.720> was

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
you tonight the classroom experience was

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.100 
you tonight the classroom experience was
very<00:05:32.070> dynamic<00:05:32.330> how<00:05:33.330> are<00:05:33.510> those<00:05:33.690> differences

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
very dynamic how are those differences

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.960 
very dynamic how are those differences
mediated<00:05:34.949> and<00:05:35.340> they<00:05:35.580> put<00:05:35.729> some<00:05:35.850> pretty
