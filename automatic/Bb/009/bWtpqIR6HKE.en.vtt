00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.060
 We 'll start with the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.880
 this corrective mine and study 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.719
 mac finnish and I'll go all over the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.710
 side 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 Why do not you go with a side so you can not 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 appear and we create a new line in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.140
 right not only in our mouth 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.650
 then I came with a powder that this is a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.670
 trick to to secure more the last button 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.210
 more time 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 now the big trick is when it comes to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 work around 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 instead of it bypassing it in the hive 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 normal mouth natural mouth 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.590
 We played nothing here at all. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 out 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.780
 You may notice that my arm is 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 well Grossinho there for it even though I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.190
 I'm getting out of my fight a little outside the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 natural line of my mouth right? 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.949
 I do this by running on empathy and he 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.989
 if there is anything 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.650
 remembering that it can be for any color 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.110
 lipstick to nude red rose so easy 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 red gives another show off me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.020
 I really like and then I come with my 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 lipstick practically the same color as the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.270
 contour is a little lighter do not 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.939
 You can tell that I'm going 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.939
 stop the darkest autumn right? 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.049
 This is going to work out ok. 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.070
 if you take where it goes from pixar in 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 team 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.020
 I'll be back with the same collective later. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.289
 known clean and pasquale here a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.380
 brush neighbor and another neighbor 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.350
 This is what happens every time 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.509
 my mouth to give an effect like but 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.119
 It seems that in the mouth it gives more ahead 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.500
 with that with this collective more 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.280
 little white 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.280
 around the mouth 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.190
 if you are noticing that running more 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.850
 clean lines not to stay too long 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.850
 couple 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 ae 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.500
 ah 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.820
 and to finish I came with a lot 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.480
 you can put a blog're one in 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.670
 middle of the mouth and a lighter lipstick a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.910
 little lighter on the table the same 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.360
 Clear tonality but more affection 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.910
 this will appear to be several more 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.260
 bulky and larger 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.310
 and it is safe to go there very quickly 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.900
 very easy 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.900
 a kiss and see you later
