childbirth<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.860> relieve<00:00:38.129> incontinence<00:00:38.899> but

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
childbirth to relieve incontinence but

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.020 
childbirth to relieve incontinence but
like<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.500> core<00:00:40.950> muscles<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.910> are

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
like the other core muscles they are

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.139 
like the other core muscles they are
also<00:00:42.270> important<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.440> posture<00:00:43.969> they<00:00:44.969> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
also important for good posture they can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
also important for good posture they can
be<00:00:45.270> activated<00:00:45.690> by<00:00:46.050> drawing<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
be activated by drawing them in as you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
be activated by drawing them in as you
would<00:00:48.210> slowly<00:00:48.600> cinch<00:00:49.079> together<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.680> threads

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
would slowly cinch together the threads

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.610 
would slowly cinch together the threads
of<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> drawstring<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.320> feeling

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of a drawstring it is the same feeling

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770 
of a drawstring it is the same feeling
as<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.399> were<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.670> stop<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> flow<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.449> urine

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
as if you were to stop the flow of urine

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.799 
as if you were to stop the flow of urine
midstream<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> key<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.210> move<00:00:57.360> slowly

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
midstream the key is to move slowly

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
midstream the key is to move slowly
gathering<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.280> by<00:00:59.550> little

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
gathering them little by little

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.650 
gathering them little by little
so<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> contraction<00:01:01.199> builds<00:01:01.500> gradually<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so the contraction builds gradually the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
so the contraction builds gradually the
transversus<00:01:04.409> abdominus<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.670> deepest

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
transversus abdominus is the deepest

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
because if you say Shh and squeeze

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
because if you say Shh and squeeze
gradually<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> pubic<00:01:46.380> bone
