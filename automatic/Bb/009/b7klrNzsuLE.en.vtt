00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.960 

so<00:00:01.620> when<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:01.890> have<00:00:02.040> fish<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.490> your<00:00:02.520> aquarium

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so when you have fish in your aquarium

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.120 
so when you have fish in your aquarium
your<00:00:03.689> fish<00:00:03.959> are<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.290> produce<00:00:04.440> waste<00:00:04.890> in

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
your fish are going to produce waste in

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.030 
your fish are going to produce waste in
the<00:00:05.220> form<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.640> ammonia<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.779> nitrite<00:00:07.290> then

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
the form of ammonia and nitrite then

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.540 
the form of ammonia and nitrite then
over<00:00:08.400> time<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.570> good<00:00:10.500> bacteria<00:00:10.650> will<00:00:11.340> break

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
over time the good bacteria will break

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
over time the good bacteria will break
the<00:00:11.700> ammonia<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.059> nitrite<00:00:12.570> into<00:00:12.840> nitrate<00:00:13.590> so

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the ammonia and nitrite into nitrate so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.779 
the ammonia and nitrite into nitrate so
nitrate<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.059> no.3<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:17.039> nitrate<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> going

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
nitrate is no.3 and the nitrate is going

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
nitrate is no.3 and the nitrate is going
to<00:00:17.850> build<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.449> aquarium<00:00:18.920> regardless

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
to build up in your aquarium regardless

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
to build up in your aquarium regardless
of<00:00:20.100> what<00:00:20.250> sort<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> aquarium<00:00:20.970> you've<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.420> then

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
of what sort of aquarium you've got then

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
of what sort of aquarium you've got then
there's<00:00:22.529> various<00:00:22.949> ways<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.640> get

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
there's various ways that you can get

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
there's various ways that you can get
rid<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> nitrate<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> freshwater

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
rid of nitrate if you have a freshwater

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
rid of nitrate if you have a freshwater
aquarium<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.640> main<00:00:26.820> way<00:00:27.000> you're<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
aquarium the main way you're going to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.820 
aquarium the main way you're going to
get<00:00:27.480> rid<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> nitrate<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.260> by<00:00:28.380> doing<00:00:28.650> water

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
get rid of nitrate is by doing water

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.710 
get rid of nitrate is by doing water
changes<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> when<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> water<00:00:30.660> change

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
changes so when you do a water change

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
changes so when you do a water change
you<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> gravel<00:00:31.710> clean<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.189> all

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
you want to do a gravel clean get all

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
you want to do a gravel clean get all
the<00:00:32.399> crap<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> gravel<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.079> want

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the crap out of the gravel and you want

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
the crap out of the gravel and you want
to<00:00:34.290> do<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> filter<00:00:34.739> clean<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> crap

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to do a filter clean to get all the crap

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
to do a filter clean to get all the crap
that<00:00:35.790> builds<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.600> filter<00:00:37.079> because

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
that builds up in your filter because

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
that builds up in your filter because
that's<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> harbor<00:00:38.730> nitrate<00:00:39.180> if

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that's all going to harbor nitrate if

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
that's all going to harbor nitrate if
you<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.230> nitrate<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.010> also

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
you do have nitrate there are also

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
you do have nitrate there are also
products<00:00:41.850> such<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.030> prime<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:43.050> will

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
products such as prime which will

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
products such as prime which will
detoxify<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.550> necessarily<00:00:45.090> get<00:00:45.390> rid

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
detoxify it so not necessarily get rid

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.959 
detoxify it so not necessarily get rid
of<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.170> stop<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.980> being<00:00:47.190> harmful<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
of it but stop it from being harmful to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.240 
of it but stop it from being harmful to
the<00:00:48.480> fish<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.680> high<00:00:49.920> levels

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the fish because at very high levels

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
the fish because at very high levels
that<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.210> reduce<00:00:51.809> an<00:00:52.020> immune<00:00:52.199> system

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that can you can reduce an immune system

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
that can you can reduce an immune system
and<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.920> forth<00:00:53.090> if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> saltwater

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
and so forth if you do have a saltwater

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
and so forth if you do have a saltwater
aquarium<00:00:55.199> you've<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> lot<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.190> options<00:00:57.059> for

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
aquarium you've got a lot of options for

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.660 
aquarium you've got a lot of options for
getting<00:00:57.899> rid<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> nitrate<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.520> get

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
getting rid of nitrate and you can get

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
getting rid of nitrate and you can get
what's<00:00:59.820> called<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> bio<00:01:00.270> pellet<00:01:00.660> reactor<00:01:00.800> and

produce<00:01:43.920> nitrate<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> make<00:01:45.509> sure

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
produce nitrate if you want to make sure

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
produce nitrate if you want to make sure
that<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:45.990> using<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.380> media<00:01:46.770> such<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.070> marine

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that you're using a media such as marine

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.899 
that you're using a media such as marine
pure<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.259> marine<00:01:49.560> pure<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
pure because the marine pure is going to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
pure because the marine pure is going to
have<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.229> parallel<00:01:52.229> denitrification<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
have a parallel denitrification and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.060 
have a parallel denitrification and
helps<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.579> get<00:01:53.700> rid<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:54.119> nitrate<00:01:55.070> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
helps you get rid of your nitrate the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.590 
helps you get rid of your nitrate the
other<00:01:56.189> thing<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.610> nitrate<00:01:57.270> 2<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
other thing to know about nitrate 2 is

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
other thing to know about nitrate 2 is
that<00:01:57.719> many<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> nitrate<00:01:58.680> tests<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.100> are

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
that many of the nitrate tests that are

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
that many of the nitrate tests that are
on<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> market<00:01:59.820> actually<00:02:00.270> only<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> very

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
on the market actually only have a very

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.870 
on the market actually only have a very
short<00:02:01.680> lifespan<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.200> lot<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.640> test<00:02:05.640> kids

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
short lifespan so a lot of test kids

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.859 
short lifespan so a lot of test kids
fail<00:02:06.799> positive<00:02:07.799> fail<00:02:08.310> negative<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> test

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
fail positive fail negative so you test

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.089 
fail positive fail negative so you test
it<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> think<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> waters<00:02:10.590> okay<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.009> it's

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it you think the waters okay but it's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.910 
it you think the waters okay but it's
not<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> nitrate<00:02:12.660> will<00:02:12.870> fail<00:02:13.140> positive

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
not but a nitrate will fail positive

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.590 
not but a nitrate will fail positive
so<00:02:14.340> you'll<00:02:14.490> think<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:14.850> really<00:02:15.030> bad<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
so you'll think it's really bad and it's

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.080 
so you'll think it's really bad and it's
not<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.950> get<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> really<00:02:17.400> bad<00:02:17.580> night

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
not so if you get a really bad night

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030 
not so if you get a really bad night
rate<00:02:18.330> reading<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> nowhere<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.740> take

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
rate reading out of nowhere then take

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.830 
rate reading out of nowhere then take
your<00:02:20.190> test<00:02:20.459> get<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.150> chrome<00:02:21.360> shop<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.750> get

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
your test get to the chrome shop and get

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.180 
your test get to the chrome shop and get
them<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.080> test<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.380> against<00:02:22.590> their<00:02:22.800> new<00:02:22.980> one

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
them to test it against their new one

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.490 
them to test it against their new one
and<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:24.300> might<00:02:24.510> find<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:25.020> test<00:02:25.230> kit<00:02:25.380> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and you might find that your test kit is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
and you might find that your test kit is
just<00:02:25.530> getting<00:02:25.980> too<00:02:26.130> old<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.490> your<00:02:26.580> test<00:02:26.790> kit

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
just getting too old in your test kit

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.010 
just getting too old in your test kit
needs<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.300> be<00:02:27.420> replaced

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
needs to be replaced

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.650 
needs to be replaced
so<00:02:28.860> nitrate<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:29.880> also<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.209> affected<00:02:30.540> by<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
so nitrate will also be affected by the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.300 
so nitrate will also be affected by the
quality<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> food<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.860> feed<00:02:32.070> very

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
quality of the food if you feed very

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.160 
quality of the food if you feed very
high<00:02:32.550> quality<00:02:32.910> foods<00:02:33.150> such<00:02:33.360> as<00:02:33.390> spectrum<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
high quality foods such as spectrum and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.990 
high quality foods such as spectrum and
what's<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> belly<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.490> fish<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.820> don't

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
what's the belly the fish and don't

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.430 
what's the belly the fish and don't
overfeed<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.480> fish<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.020> will<00:02:37.140> helps<00:02:37.320> keep

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
overfeed your fish that will helps keep

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.920 
overfeed your fish that will helps keep
your<00:02:37.530> nitrates<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.130> too<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.300> anyway<00:02:39.660> put<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
your nitrates down too so anyway put a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.350 
your nitrates down too so anyway put a
little<00:02:40.080> note<00:02:40.590> down<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> bottom<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:42.120> let

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
little note down the bottom and I'm let

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.180 
little note down the bottom and I'm let
me<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.570> how<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.810> fix<00:02:43.200> your<00:02:43.440> nitrates<00:02:43.920> and

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
me know how you fix your nitrates and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
me know how you fix your nitrates and
it's<00:02:47.190> very<00:02:47.520> easy<00:02:47.760> these<00:02:47.970> days<00:02:48.030> low<00:02:48.540> nitrates

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
it's very easy these days low nitrates

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.590 
it's very easy these days low nitrates
equals<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.550> potential<00:02:51.270> for<00:02:51.480> less

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
equals the potential for less

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.690 
equals the potential for less
maintenance<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:53.010> ability<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.459> carry

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
maintenance and the ability to carry

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.610 
maintenance and the ability to carry
more<00:02:54.000> stock<00:02:54.360> other<00:02:54.660> products<00:02:55.050> a<00:02:55.140> polyfill

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
more stock other products a polyfill

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.140 
more stock other products a polyfill
that's<00:02:55.950> another<00:02:56.190> one<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.430> quite<00:02:56.790> good<00:02:56.970> for

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that's another one that's quite good for

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.660 
that's another one that's quite good for
lowering<00:02:57.900> nitrates<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.100> aquarium

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
lowering nitrates and so is aquarium

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.820 
lowering nitrates and so is aquarium
detox<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.080> anyway<00:03:01.320> there's<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> whole<00:03:01.650> lot<00:03:01.800> of

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
detox so anyway there's a whole lot of

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.259 
detox so anyway there's a whole lot of
names<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:02.310> rattled<00:03:02.790> off<00:03:02.850> four<00:03:03.090> things

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
names I just rattled off four things

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.030 
names I just rattled off four things
that<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.660> do<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.410> help<00:03:04.590> reduce<00:03:04.830> your

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that you can do to help reduce your

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.490 
that you can do to help reduce your
nitrate<00:03:05.519> level<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.600> send<00:03:06.930> me<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.050> question

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
nitrate level and I'm send me a question

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.430 
nitrate level and I'm send me a question
if<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.860> want<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.100> learn<00:03:08.220> more
