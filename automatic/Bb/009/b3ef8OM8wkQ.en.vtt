00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
building rules on your turn you're going

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.960 
building rules on your turn you're going
to<00:02:10.879> roll<00:02:11.270> two<00:02:11.450> dice<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:12.590> this<00:02:12.800> is<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.370> platform

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
to roll two dice if this is my platform

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.020 
to roll two dice if this is my platform
here<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:15.140> just<00:02:15.170> rolled<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.950> double<00:02:16.370> floor<00:02:16.640> i

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
here and I just rolled a double floor i

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.900 
here and I just rolled a double floor i
put<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.989> nice<00:02:18.140> over<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:19.040> i<00:02:19.280> evaluate

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
put the nice over here and i evaluate

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.170 
put the nice over here and i evaluate
what<00:02:20.120> my<00:02:20.270> situation<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
what my situation is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.479 
what my situation is
somehow<00:02:23.079> these<00:02:23.230> snuck<00:02:23.560> on<00:02:23.769> there<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.250> didn't

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
somehow these snuck on there you didn't

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.490 
somehow these snuck on there you didn't
see<00:02:24.609> that<00:02:24.640> happen<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.359> it's<00:02:25.659> really<00:02:26.109> nothing

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
see that happen it's it's really nothing

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.819 
see that happen it's it's really nothing
it<00:02:27.459> was<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> three<00:02:28.450> okay<00:02:29.049> there<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.709> is

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
it was really a three okay there it is

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.599 
it was really a three okay there it is
your<00:02:30.189> side<00:02:30.519> Patrick<00:02:31.120> Ness<00:02:31.390> what<00:02:31.659> it<00:02:31.719> was<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
your side Patrick Ness what it was and

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.580 
your side Patrick Ness what it was and
now<00:02:33.609> if<00:02:33.939> I'm<00:02:34.150> building<00:02:34.659> this<00:02:35.079> installation

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
now if I'm building this installation

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.509 
now if I'm building this installation
here<00:02:36.340> I'm<00:02:37.060> looking<00:02:37.299> for<00:02:37.659> this<00:02:37.780> platform<00:02:38.519> which

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
here I'm looking for this platform which

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.059 
here I'm looking for this platform which
I've<00:02:39.700> got<00:02:39.909> built<00:02:40.209> already<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:41.620> can<00:02:41.829> bill

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
I've got built already and I can bill

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.839 
I've got built already and I can bill
either<00:02:42.459> an<00:02:42.849> adjacent<00:02:43.510> number<00:02:44.129> like<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.400> three

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
either an adjacent number like a three

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.209 
either an adjacent number like a three
and<00:02:46.389> I<00:02:46.689> just<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.139> didn't<00:02:47.500> roll<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.799> three<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.189> I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
and I just I didn't roll the three so I

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.490 
and I just I didn't roll the three so I
can't<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.639> that<00:02:48.670> or<00:02:49.569> an<00:02:49.689> adjacent<00:02:50.170> number<00:02:50.409> in

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
can't do that or an adjacent number in

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.490 
can't do that or an adjacent number in
this<00:02:50.620> case<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:51.189> four<00:02:51.639> so<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.599> can<00:02:52.840> put<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.109> next

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
this case of four so I can put that next

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.860 
this case of four so I can put that next
to<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.829> five<00:02:54.099> okay<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.849> can<00:02:55.030> also<00:02:55.150> put<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.599> six

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
to the five okay you can also put a six

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.500 
to the five okay you can also put a six
there<00:02:56.139> and<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:57.220> stacking<00:02:57.760> rule<00:02:58.030> i'm<00:02:58.239> looking

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
there and the stacking rule i'm looking

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020 
there and the stacking rule i'm looking
for<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.870> tower<00:02:59.139> here<00:02:59.500> too<00:02:59.769> high<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.549> only<00:03:00.849> thing

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
for a tower here too high the only thing

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.509 
for a tower here too high the only thing
i<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.180> stack<00:03:01.629> is<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.439> same<00:03:02.859> number<00:03:03.099> i<00:03:03.220> just

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
i can stack is the same number i just

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.490 
i can stack is the same number i just
happened<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:03.909> roll<00:03:04.090> for<00:03:04.419> it<00:03:04.689> so<00:03:04.870> those<00:03:05.319> are

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
happened to roll for it so those are

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.229 
happened to roll for it so those are
both<00:03:05.650> going<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:05.950> work<00:03:06.099> right<00:03:06.310> there<00:03:06.609> all<00:03:07.030> right

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
both going to work right there all right

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.149 
both going to work right there all right
and<00:03:07.480> I've<00:03:07.569> almost<00:03:07.810> got<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.439> structure<00:03:08.919> built

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
and I've almost got this structure built

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.690 
and I've almost got this structure built
next<00:03:09.459> turn<00:03:09.819> I'll<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.689> looking<00:03:11.109> for<00:03:11.700> double

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
next turn I'll be looking for double

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.569 
next turn I'll be looking for double
threes<00:03:12.939> or<00:03:13.389> delta<00:03:13.900> fives<00:03:14.139> because<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.459> go

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
threes or delta fives because I can go

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.270 
threes or delta fives because I can go
with<00:03:15.760> Jason<00:03:15.939> so<00:03:16.659> always<00:03:16.959> stacking<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
with Jason so always stacking is the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.119 
with Jason so always stacking is the
same<00:03:18.519> number<00:03:18.870> adjacent<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.079> consecutive<00:03:20.980> no

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
same number adjacent is consecutive no

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.920 
same number adjacent is consecutive no
case<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.700> that's<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.389> building<00:03:22.750> rose

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
case and that's it for the building rose

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.500 
case and that's it for the building rose
game<00:03:23.889> is<00:03:24.040> over<00:03:24.219> when<00:03:24.579> one<00:03:24.819> player<00:03:24.969> is<00:03:25.239> built

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
game is over when one player is built

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.809 
game is over when one player is built
either<00:03:25.689> five<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:26.379> or<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.220> museum<00:03:27.699> is

of get there by the way I could have

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.910 
of get there by the way I could have
built<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:41.100> here<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:43.320> could<00:03:43.770> be

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
built this to here and now I could be

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.220 
built this to here and now I could be
still<00:03:44.190> building<00:03:44.550> either<00:03:44.760> this<00:03:45.090> structure<00:03:45.660> or

I could building be building this

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.210 
I could building be building this
structure<00:03:48.570> it's<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.290> race<00:03:49.560> you're<00:03:49.950> competing

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the same three structures I can also if

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.190 
the same three structures I can also if
I've<00:03:56.580> come<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> point<00:03:57.390> where<00:03:57.630> if<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.840> didn't
