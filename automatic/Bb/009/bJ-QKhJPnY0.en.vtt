cooked us were boiled in oil mixing at

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:29.790 
cooked us were boiled in oil mixing at
the<00:01:15.980> time<00:01:16.930> at<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.380> moon

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:42.940 

some<00:01:30.800> more<00:01:31.550> from<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.510> cooked<00:01:32.810> out<00:01:33.080> water

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.910 

and<00:01:43.950> continue<00:01:44.939> mixing<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.570> manage<00:01:45.930> though<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and continue mixing to manage though the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.210 
and continue mixing to manage though the
reason<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.549> mix<00:01:47.789> until<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.720> yogurt<00:01:49.200> boys<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
reason we mix until the yogurt boys is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.600 
reason we mix until the yogurt boys is
so<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> doesn't<00:01:51.570> curdle<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.009> smooth

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so that it doesn't curdle so it's smooth

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.730 
so that it doesn't curdle so it's smooth
soup

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
soup

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
soup
sometimes<00:01:55.740> after<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> effort<00:01:57.509> it's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
sometimes after all the effort it's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.029 
sometimes after all the effort it's
still<00:01:58.319> curdle

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
still curdle

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.520 
still curdle
so<00:01:59.220> it's<00:01:59.909> okay<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.600> loop<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
so it's okay the loop will not be the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.660 
so it's okay the loop will not be the
same<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.460> taste<00:02:02.759> will<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.600> change<00:02:04.670> out

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
same but the taste will not change out

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.870 
same but the taste will not change out
from<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> cocktail<00:02:06.720> water<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.590> much<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.550> you

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
from the cocktail water as much as you

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.059 
from the cocktail water as much as you
like<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> soup<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.860> be

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
like it if you would like the soup to be

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.580 
like it if you would like the soup to be
light<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.239> add<00:02:12.390> more<00:02:12.599> water<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.410> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
light you can add more water and if you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.850 
light you can add more water and if you
prefer<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> thick<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:16.049> put<00:02:16.590> too

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
prefer it thick then you don't put too

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.830 
prefer it thick then you don't put too
much<00:02:16.890> water<00:02:17.310> because<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.180> cornstarch

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
much water because there is cornstarch

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.940 
much water because there is cornstarch
and<00:02:19.140> egg<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:21.000> will<00:02:21.299> thicken<00:02:21.569> once<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.560> comes<00:02:22.830> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and egg it will thicken once it comes to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.360 
and egg it will thicken once it comes to
boil<00:02:23.340> even<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.269> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.690> see<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.830> soup<00:02:26.130> has

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
boil even then if you see the soup has

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.120 
boil even then if you see the soup has
become<00:02:26.760> too<00:02:27.030> teeth<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.900> still<00:02:28.440> add<00:02:28.650> water

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
become too teeth you can still add water

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.630 
become too teeth you can still add water
but<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.260> constantly<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.280> to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
but you have constantly you have to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.539 
but you have constantly you have to
steer<00:02:33.090> until<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.019> boils<00:02:34.319> that's<00:02:35.130> very

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
steer until it boils that's very

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.000 
steer until it boils that's very
important<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:37.079> this<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> consistency

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
important if this is the consistency

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.670 
important if this is the consistency
that<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> then<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.450> don't<00:02:39.630> add<00:02:39.870> no<00:02:40.380> more

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
that you like then you don't add no more
