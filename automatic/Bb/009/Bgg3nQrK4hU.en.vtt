coming closer and give me more options
for<00:01:37.039> actually<00:01:37.399> framing<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.850> photograph<00:01:38.530> so

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
for actually framing the photograph so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:57.570 
for actually framing the photograph so
we'll<00:01:39.800> go<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.190> now

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.740 

you've<00:01:58.580> put<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.850> camera<00:01:59.150> directly<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.720> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
you've put the camera directly on a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.560 
you've put the camera directly on a
beanbag<00:02:00.050> that's<00:02:00.500> sitting<00:02:01.159> on<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.370> floor<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
beanbag that's sitting on the floor the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.730 
beanbag that's sitting on the floor the
reason<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.900> we've<00:02:03.020> done<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.620> give

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
reason that we've done this is to give

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.590 
reason that we've done this is to give
us<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.920> low<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.340> intimate<00:02:04.760> view<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.300> Swan

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
us a low and intimate view of the Swan

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.570 
us a low and intimate view of the Swan
because<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:06.619> not<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.770> viewpoint<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.310> most

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
because it's not a viewpoint that most

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.370 
because it's not a viewpoint that most
people<00:02:07.940> see<00:02:08.209> most<00:02:08.509> people<00:02:08.840> see<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.080> world

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
people see most people see the world

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.800 
people see most people see the world
from<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.220> standing<00:02:10.610> position<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.630> take

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
from a standing position so if you take

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.020 
from a standing position so if you take
your<00:02:11.930> photograph<00:02:12.440> from<00:02:12.650> much<00:02:12.890> lower<00:02:13.160> down<00:02:13.459> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
your photograph from much lower down it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.860 
your photograph from much lower down it
can<00:02:14.180> make<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.330> far<00:02:14.660> more<00:02:14.690> interesting

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
can make a far more interesting

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.130 
can make a far more interesting
photograph<00:02:16.030> well<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.090> also<00:02:17.270> looking<00:02:17.510> at<00:02:17.870> here

photograph well I'm also looking at here

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
photograph well I'm also looking at here
is<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.350> background<00:02:18.860> if<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.130> take<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> photograph

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
is the background if I take a photograph

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.210 
is the background if I take a photograph
with<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> beam<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.959> they're<00:02:21.290> looking<00:02:22.130> at

with the beam like they're looking at

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.920 
with the beam like they're looking at
the<00:02:22.340> swamp<00:02:22.640> I've<00:02:23.239> got<00:02:23.390> lots<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.690> white

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the swamp I've got lots of white

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.199 
the swamp I've got lots of white
highlights<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> background<00:02:25.280> don't<00:02:26.060> look

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
highlights in the background don't look

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.910 
highlights in the background don't look
all<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.420> good<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.959> move<00:02:27.170> just<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.530> foot<00:02:27.770> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
all that good if I move just a foot this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.220 
all that good if I move just a foot this
way<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:29.090> use<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.360> trees<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> dark

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
way I can use the trees as a dark

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.930 
way I can use the trees as a dark
background<00:02:30.500> then<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.040> means<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> Swan

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
background then it means that the Swan

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.479 
background then it means that the Swan
really<00:02:32.300> stands<00:02:32.600> out<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.709> you<00:02:33.800> can<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.250> really

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
really stands out so you can be really

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.800 
really stands out so you can be really
careful<00:02:34.820> with<00:02:34.910> your<00:02:34.970> backgrounds<00:02:35.450> cuz<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.720> can

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
careful with your backgrounds cuz it can

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
careful with your backgrounds cuz it can
make<00:02:35.989> or<00:02:36.200> break<00:02:36.350> a<00:02:36.470> photograph

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.800 

see<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:41.120> what<00:02:41.270> we've<00:02:41.390> done<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.690> we've

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
see here what we've done is we've

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.750 
see here what we've done is we've
actually<00:02:41.990> set<00:02:42.319> up<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.560> camera<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.670> we

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
actually set up the camera so that we

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.790 
actually set up the camera so that we
use<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.209> trees<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> background<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.709> you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
use in the trees as a background and you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.170 
use in the trees as a background and you
can<00:02:45.950> see<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.280> there's<00:02:46.490> no<00:02:46.700> distracting

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
can see that there's no distracting

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.309 
can see that there's no distracting
highlights<00:02:47.840> in<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.800> background<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:51.020> can<00:02:51.170> see

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
highlights in the background you can see

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.690 
highlights in the background you can see
that<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:51.650> we've<00:02:51.830> moved<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.190> camera<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that here we've moved the camera in the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.580 
that here we've moved the camera in the
beanbag<00:02:52.910> slightly<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.230> right<00:02:54.380> hand

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
beanbag slightly and on the right hand

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.930 
beanbag slightly and on the right hand
side<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.040> picture<00:02:55.220> you've<00:02:55.490> got<00:02:55.670> lights

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
side of the picture you've got lights

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.940 
side of the picture you've got lights
coming<00:02:56.270> through<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.660> trees<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.800> just

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
coming through the trees and it just

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.350 
coming through the trees and it just
distracts<00:02:58.100> from<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.670> background<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.209> just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
distracts from the background it just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.750 
distracts from the background it just
takes<00:02:59.569> something<00:02:59.840> away<00:03:00.050> from<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.500> swamp<00:03:00.760> so

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
takes something away from the swamp so

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.860 
takes something away from the swamp so
here<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.090> haven't<00:03:02.360> controlled<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
here we haven't controlled the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.000 
here we haven't controlled the
background<00:03:03.290> in<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.560> way<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:03.950> should

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
background in the way that we should

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.380 
background in the way that we should
have<00:03:04.250> done

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.380 

I<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.860> linked<00:03:15.100> loads<00:03:15.340> graphing<00:03:15.790> swans<00:03:16.120> they

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
I just linked loads graphing swans they

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
I just linked loads graphing swans they
always<00:03:16.630> seem<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.810> give<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.200> different

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
always seem to give you a different

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.240 
always seem to give you a different
picture

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
picture

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.610 
picture
if<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.030> careful<00:03:19.450> around<00:03:19.510> them<00:03:20.020> they<00:03:20.440> won't

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
if you careful around them they won't

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.080 
if you careful around them they won't
come<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.250> they're<00:03:21.370> not<00:03:21.459> aggressive<00:03:21.700> at

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
come for you they're not aggressive at

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.730 
come for you they're not aggressive at
all<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.630> think<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.140> might<00:03:23.290> be<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.500> combination

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
all I think it might be the combination

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.440 
all I think it might be the combination
of<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> black<00:03:24.580> and<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.940> whites<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.390> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
of the black and the whites and the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.590 
of the black and the whites and the
orange<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:27.490> can<00:03:27.640> get<00:03:27.850> down<00:03:28.060> low<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.540> you
