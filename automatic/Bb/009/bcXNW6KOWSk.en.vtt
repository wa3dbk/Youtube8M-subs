00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
to get an accurate shot but obviously

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.710 
to get an accurate shot but obviously
the<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.640> marker<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> use<00:01:27.509> is

the but the the marker that you use is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
the but the the marker that you use is
important<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.530> everybody<00:01:28.890> has<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
important because everybody has a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.020 
important because everybody has a
different<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.880> see

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
there's many different markers to choose

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.600 
there's many different markers to choose
from<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.299> prefer<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.229> crosshair<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.009> just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
from I prefer the crosshair one just

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
from I prefer the crosshair one just
because<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.119> looks<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
because it looks like to me it looks the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
because it looks like to me it looks the
most<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.640> target<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the center is I just put the center of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
the center is I just put the center of
the<00:01:42.960> Cross<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> target<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the Cross on the target and I know that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
the Cross on the target and I know that
that's<00:01:44.880> gonna<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> shell<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.840> likely

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
that's gonna that the shell is likely

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.830 
that's gonna that the shell is likely
gonna<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.420> there's<00:01:48.600> more

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
gonna go there I think it's there's more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
gonna go there I think it's there's more
guesswork<00:01:49.170> involved<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:49.890> other

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
guesswork involved with these other

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
guesswork involved with these other
markers<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.799> prefer<00:01:53.540> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
markers so I just I just prefer this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.230 
markers so I just I just prefer this
marker<00:01:54.930> better<00:01:55.430> there's<00:01:56.430> other<00:01:56.579> things<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
marker better there's other things and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
marker better there's other things and
there's<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> same<00:01:58.409> exact<00:01:58.740> settings<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
there's the same exact settings for the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.749 
there's the same exact settings for the
gun<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> same<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.490> same

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
gun you can get the same the very same

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.780 
gun you can get the same the very same
things<00:02:03.229> then<00:02:04.229> there's<00:02:04.619> also<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
things then there's also the the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
things then there's also the the
transparency<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.600> all<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> indicators<00:02:07.259> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
transparency of all the indicators so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.150 
transparency of all the indicators so
you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.740> your<00:02:08.569> your<00:02:09.569> loader<00:02:10.379> your<00:02:10.860> loading

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
you know your your loader your loading

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.420 
you know your your loader your loading
indicator<00:02:11.280> down<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.150> can

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
indicator down here you can

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.490 
indicator down here you can
go<00:02:12.670> away<00:02:12.879> I<00:02:13.150> usually<00:02:13.719> play<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.109> everything

go away I usually play on everything
with<00:02:14.620> 90%<00:02:14.920> transparency<00:02:15.879> just<00:02:15.909> because<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
with 90% transparency just because I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.149 
with 90% transparency just because I
just<00:02:18.730> like<00:02:18.939> to<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.469> exactly<00:02:20.920> what's

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
just like to have to know exactly what's

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.289 
just like to have to know exactly what's
going<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:22.109> now<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.370> other<00:02:24.489> thing<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.790> also

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
going on now the other thing is also

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.390 
going on now the other thing is also
very<00:02:25.659> important<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:26.980> game<00:02:27.189> the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
very important this is just the game the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.429 
very important this is just the game the
in-game<00:02:27.790> example<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.599> what<00:02:28.750> it'll<00:02:29.019> appear<00:02:29.290> do

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
in-game example of what it'll appear do

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.649 
in-game example of what it'll appear do
it<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:30.099> marker<00:02:30.549> settings<00:02:31.060> are<00:02:31.420> very

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
it the marker settings are very

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.479 
it the marker settings are very
important<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.379> they're<00:02:32.920> also<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.310> thing

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
important and they're also the thing

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.539 
important and they're also the thing
that<00:02:33.639> I<00:02:33.670> see<00:02:33.969> people<00:02:34.000> neglect<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.989> most<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
that I see people neglect the most the

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.849 
that I see people neglect the most the
markers<00:02:37.030> are<00:02:37.299> very<00:02:37.900> very<00:02:38.260> helpful<00:02:38.500> in

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
markers are very very helpful in

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.170 
markers are very very helpful in
assessing<00:02:39.159> the<00:02:39.459> situation<00:02:39.609> on<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
assessing the situation on the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.959 
assessing the situation on the
battlefield<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> let's<00:02:42.489> go<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> first

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
battlefield so let's go to the first

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.849 
battlefield so let's go to the first
option<00:02:43.450> vehicle<00:02:43.900> durability<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:44.560> see

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
option vehicle durability you see

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.559 
option vehicle durability you see
there's<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.099> couple<00:02:45.280> options<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.970> can<00:02:46.329> get<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
there's a couple options you can get the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.569 
there's a couple options you can get the
percent<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.139> can<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.439> how<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.650> changes<00:02:47.680> so

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
percent you can see how that changes so

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.550 
percent you can see how that changes so
now<00:02:48.700> instead<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:49.030> what<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.959> saw<00:02:50.109> was<00:02:50.290> mine

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
now instead of what you saw was mine

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.470 
now instead of what you saw was mine
this<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> game's<00:02:51.310> default<00:02:51.730> vehicle

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
this is the game's default vehicle

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.000 
this is the game's default vehicle
durability<00:02:53.049> indicator<00:02:53.409> you<00:02:53.590> could<00:02:53.739> just<00:02:53.919> see

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
durability indicator you could just see

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.890 
durability indicator you could just see
the<00:02:54.040> percentage<00:02:54.609> so<00:02:55.389> you<00:02:55.419> can<00:02:55.599> see<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the percentage so you can see the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.280 
the percentage so you can see the
sponsor<00:02:56.260> come<00:02:56.439> flagons<00:02:56.829> idea<00:02:57.219> is<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:58.290> 83%

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
sponsor come flagons idea is that 83%

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.220 
sponsor come flagons idea is that 83%
and<00:02:59.739> this<00:03:00.099> Teager<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.760> at<00:03:00.909> 92%<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.569> then<00:03:04.569> you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and this Teager is at 92% and then you

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.229 
and this Teager is at 92% and then you
can<00:03:05.379> see<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.919> HP<00:03:06.280> left<00:03:06.489> out<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.879> total

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
can see the the HP left out of the total

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.599 
can see the the HP left out of the total
they<00:03:07.359> have<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.129> see<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
they have and then you can see just the

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.729 
they have and then you can see just the
HP<00:03:09.939> left<00:03:10.150> or<00:03:10.419> you<00:03:10.540> could<00:03:10.659> hide<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:10.989> completely

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
HP left or you could hide it completely

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.640 
HP left or you could hide it completely
I<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.359> HP<00:03:13.689> left<00:03:13.930> out<00:03:14.109> of<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.290> total

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
I like the HP left out of the total

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.610 
I like the HP left out of the total
because<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.669> think<00:03:16.000> getting<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.449> real<00:03:16.930> solid

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
because I think getting a real solid

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.159 
because I think getting a real solid
numerical<00:03:18.459> value<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.180> assess<00:03:19.510> how<00:03:19.750> much<00:03:19.930> HP

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
numerical value to assess how much HP

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.500 
numerical value to assess how much HP
they<00:03:20.530> have<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.979> important<00:03:21.909> in<00:03:22.030> making<00:03:22.239> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
they have is important in making a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.729 
they have is important in making a
decision<00:03:23.760> because<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.359> go<00:03:25.540> 2<00:03:25.599> percent<00:03:26.049> let's

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
decision because if I go 2 percent let's

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.259 
decision because if I go 2 percent let's
say<00:03:26.829> I'm<00:03:26.919> driving<00:03:27.220> my<00:03:27.280> patent<00:03:27.639> and<00:03:27.879> I<00:03:27.939> know<00:03:28.000> my

damage<00:03:30.849> if<00:03:31.629> I<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:32.139> see<00:03:32.260> 92<00:03:32.709> percent<00:03:33.280> or<00:03:33.689> or

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
damage if I just see 92 percent or or

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.059 
damage if I just see 92 percent or or
let's<00:03:34.900> say<00:03:34.989> he's<00:03:35.139> close<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.530> death<00:03:35.680> let's<00:03:35.949> say
