larger than your typical pocket camera
your<00:03:46.400> pocket<00:03:46.849> digital<00:03:47.139> but<00:03:48.139> yet<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:48.859> has<00:03:49.099> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
your pocket digital but yet this has the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.589 
your pocket digital but yet this has the
same<00:03:49.579> size<00:03:49.940> sensor<00:03:50.659> as<00:03:51.139> a<00:03:51.769> DSLR<00:03:52.609> camera<00:03:53.150> so

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
same size sensor as a DSLR camera so

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.969 
same size sensor as a DSLR camera so
it's<00:03:53.720> going<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:53.959> real<00:03:54.319> interesting<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.829> see

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:54.979 
it's going to be real interesting to see

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.770 
it's going to be real interesting to see
the<00:03:55.010> quality<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.639> photos<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.269> get<00:03:56.479> from<00:03:56.659> this

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
the quality of photos we get from this

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.289
