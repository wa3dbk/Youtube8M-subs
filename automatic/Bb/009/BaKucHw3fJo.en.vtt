00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.580
 but 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.980
 Hello friends decided to change it from 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:27.449
 the processor does not stand now under water and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.410
 Vasin 200 will change it for more 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:38.149
 powerful decided to put 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.149
 xeon x5 450 means my old processor 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.370
 will insert 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.310
 but before you need to insert here 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:11.180
 stick and wreaths 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:11.180
 here if you can see here in this place and 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 remove 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 divide 2 spoke in 1 2 to processor 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:32.750
 could install 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:37.070
 as these two protrusions interfere with the pants we 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.759
 now remove put and so acceptance 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.140
 green felled tried krezi not even 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.080
 let's live a new blade 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.080
 I did n't have this case 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.400
 try to understand 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.650
 so as seen from one side I deleted 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 here in this place 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.140
 and now 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:44.360
 we will remove from this side of the process from you 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:52.250
 will and go down 1 socket am3 wreaths 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 need to delete because under 785 they are so 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:10.120
 I try as I can see I deleted the dead omichki 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.180
 if you can put as honest 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.570
 the price we will know here a corner on which 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.290
 there is such a triangle 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:48.880
 on scales and whether there is a hijacker here cut off 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.880
 all three sides therefore so 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.880
 install 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.320
 means to pull simple she calls so 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.320
 thin layer 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:37.300
 then we give in to such small ones 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.850
 dots that is just such a dose 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.680
 which is necessary that is, you do not have much 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:47.550
 I will spread a lot too 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.570
 such a wand 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.570
 generally kopecks leave the whole thing 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:13.230
 behavior but now we will 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:14.430
 connect the monitor check so after 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.860
 CPU installation 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.040
 the system started without any dancing 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.730
 Dental everything is well defined now and 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.870
 by recording 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:28.150
 frame 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:33.670
 let's see i will show you that this process 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.780
 x 54 letter here it is 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.780
 works fine 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:46.070
 3 frequencies throw up to 2 that is 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:48.080
 the system works at the disposal of Izh-12 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.590
 Well, in general, everything works the only thing 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:56.300
 when you start it does not first 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.350
 lost to fight with turkey russia 41 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:04.230
 omon virtualization 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:08.180
 to have this whole thing work had 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:12.020
 install mod by us morbius i 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.020
 installed using the program 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.850
 lifting bike 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.640
 that is restored I loved 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.640
 r14 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.830
 here and then there will be again 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.960
 detail and russia 41 that much 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:38.349
 increased performance on performance 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.349
 process 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:45.259
 made a second life juices 585 on 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.069
 some time I have enough of this 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:52.099
 cpu all so quad and 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:57.009
 it is very noticeable instrumentation on this all 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:57.009
 subscribe to my channel bye
