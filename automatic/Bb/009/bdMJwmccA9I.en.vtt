got not memory chips this box has mainly
memory<00:03:23.660> chips<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.260> see<00:03:25.330> all<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.510> IC<00:03:26.870> cards

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
memory chips as you see all the IC cards

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.290 
memory chips as you see all the IC cards
have<00:03:27.739> been<00:03:27.920> taken<00:03:28.370> off<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.519> these<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.180> it's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
have been taken off of these and it's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.210 
have been taken off of these and it's
just<00:03:29.510> pure<00:03:29.870> chips<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.470> have<00:03:30.590> two<00:03:30.680> chips<00:03:30.950> off<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
just pure chips I have two chips off the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.970 
just pure chips I have two chips off the
chips<00:03:31.610> laughter<00:03:31.880> chips<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:33.410> all<00:03:33.620> there<00:03:33.860> is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
chips laughter chips so all there is

chips laughter chips so all there is
chips<00:03:34.720> now<00:03:35.720> what<00:03:35.900> I've<00:03:36.050> noticed<00:03:36.230> on<00:03:36.470> some<00:03:36.800> of

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
chips now what I've noticed on some of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.580 
chips now what I've noticed on some of
these<00:03:36.980> I'm<00:03:37.160> going<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.430> try<00:03:37.580> and<00:03:37.730> find<00:03:38.000> one

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
these I'm going to try and find one

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.900 
these I'm going to try and find one
because<00:03:39.590> people<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:40.040> cut<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.400> fingers<00:03:40.790> off

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
because people just cut the fingers off

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:53.290 
because people just cut the fingers off
and<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:47.810> you<00:03:47.870> go<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.430> gold<00:03:52.700> printed<00:03:53.150> on

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
and there you go the gold printed on

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.050 
and there you go the gold printed on
there<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:54.130> absolutely<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:56.840> over<00:03:57.260> it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
there is absolutely all over it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.509 
there is absolutely all over it
all<00:03:59.060> those<00:03:59.239> little<00:03:59.510> dots<00:03:59.870> of<00:04:00.080> don't<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.709> I'm

not<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.790> gonna<00:04:02.090> break<00:04:02.300> off<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.660> fingers<00:04:03.019> I'm

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
not just gonna break off the fingers I'm

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.729 
not just gonna break off the fingers I'm
gonna<00:04:03.290> process<00:04:03.830> a<00:04:03.860> whole<00:04:04.010> lot<00:04:05.019> as<00:04:06.019> nearly<00:04:06.410> 5

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
gonna process a whole lot as nearly 5

kilos here a peak of all the different
boards<00:04:12.080> I've<00:04:12.200> got<00:04:12.410> whether<00:04:12.650> it's

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
boards I've got whether it's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.570 
boards I've got whether it's
motherboards<00:04:13.790> bits<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.480> them<00:04:14.720> as<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:16.160> said<00:04:16.370> B's

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
motherboards bits of them as I said B's

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
so yeah it's a lot of stuff to process

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.170 
so yeah it's a lot of stuff to process
and<00:04:30.310> I'm<00:04:30.460> gonna<00:04:30.640> have<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> lot<00:04:31.150> of

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
and I'm gonna have to do a lot of

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.200 
and I'm gonna have to do a lot of
reading<00:04:31.450> up<00:04:31.750> I'm<00:04:32.110> not<00:04:32.410> learning<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:33.210> mean

reading up I'm not learning I mean
that's<00:04:34.540> another<00:04:34.720> telephone<00:04:35.080> board<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.040> it's

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
that's another telephone board and it's

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.830 
that's another telephone board and it's
good<00:04:36.460> unless<00:04:36.910> you've<00:04:37.240> got<00:04:37.420> the<00:04:37.570> gold

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
good unless you've got the gold

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.010 
good unless you've got the gold
connectors<00:04:38.140> on<00:04:38.560> it

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
connectors on it

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.930 
connectors on it
it's<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.200> ladened<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:43.380> lot<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.470> work<00:04:44.650> here

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
it's just ladened so a lot of work here

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.130 
it's just ladened so a lot of work here
