00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.660
 computer keyboard so for that he 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.099
 we need to be a rule his pen 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.920
 something of alopecia preference so 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 or a screwdriver and that can do it 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:23.020
 also hot water and product 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.510
 basic to wash the dishes so 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.640
 with your flat object our me with my 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.240
 rule we will come to remove the keys from 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.890
 keyboard so you take a touch you 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.840
 come and blow it up that's it 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.149
 jump alone you're going to do that they 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.760
 go like these one of the classes to 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.219
 some excesses etc 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.630
 oh yes little advice I advise you 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.940
 to take a picture before your 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.590
 keyboard like that you would not have any 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.390
 problem to go back to them or so if 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.450
 you forgot the picture you can 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.600
 to see them on the internet during 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.199
 keys and so that's once there you 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:07.420
 put some product scenes in your 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:09.909
 hot and after you come take yourself 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.159
 touch you will come and degrease 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.200
 in soapy water so you 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.639
 do one by one and it's you go 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.569
 come and degrease them so you go 

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:24.729
 see it's pretty fat anyway but we 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.560
 continues and 1 continues you do everything 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.609
 your keyboard by dismantling their early 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.759
 little tips also the big the 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:36.969
 departure and the space bar and and the entrance 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.259
 all that they have a small a little 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.049
 metal spring in fact it's a 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.329
 little thing like this so for the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.899
 put back or you the floor in 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.759
 balls including one in the small notch and 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.389
 you will come and drag it in the east 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.700
 the little things and the little things there that 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:57.999
 serves to maintain the bar so we are 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.309
 slipped one rotates and boxed and 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:03.849
 So that's it for his stockings 

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:05.090
 all of this 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.179
 this one this one 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.489
 if these two there he also has one of the two 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.120
 there too and it's so good if not 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.220
 the letters and numbers keys etc are 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.300
 quite basic keys how much 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.160
 go canned and so once 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.930
 touch up well wash everything you go 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.660
 come to dry them very important so the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.239
 so dry with a cloth or a small 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.180
 blow of breath is if you have a 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.640
 compressor and for the interior you 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.280
 go for a rag shot like 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.750
 if these through the keys for 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.569
 well come sandstone to withdraw the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.430
 crumbs and so on and give a little 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.480
 blow of compressors for coming soon 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.130
 to dry because it's still 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.810
 electronic and do not like too much logan 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.450
 so after you just go 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.400
 nothing in box and simple keys 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.170
 like these and here you go all 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.910
 reassembled with the photo did you or 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.720
 with your model you will have found 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.629
 on the Internet 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.930
 and here you are your keyboard will be everything 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.090
 clean and especially eliminate from all 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.400
 microbes that will have more accumulate on 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.389
 during the different uses 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.620
