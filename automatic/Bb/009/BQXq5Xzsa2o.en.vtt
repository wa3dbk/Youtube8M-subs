emotions that we all have felt or tried
to<00:01:52.920> deny<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:56.850> funny<00:01:57.179> it's<00:01:58.190> really

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
to deny and so it's funny it's really

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.790 
to deny and so it's funny it's really
action-packed<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:03.179> will<00:02:03.780> make<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:04.200> cry<00:02:04.470> I

I<00:02:10.730> am<00:02:11.730> fascinated<00:02:12.330> by<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.440> emotion<00:02:14.190> that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
I am fascinated by the emotion that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
because he apparently has no emotions

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
because he apparently has no emotions
but<00:02:20.580> he's<00:02:20.790> drawing<00:02:21.150> all<00:02:21.330> these<00:02:21.450> emotions<00:02:21.750> out

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
