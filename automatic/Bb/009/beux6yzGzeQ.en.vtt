00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.970
 the nucleus usually occupies part 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 central cytoplasm in a cell 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.849
 eukaryotic is formed by an envelope 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.469
 nuclear that is a double membrane 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.750
 traversed by nuclear pores that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.380
 regulate the flow of materials between the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 nucleus and cytoplasm the external part 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.449
 of the membrane has two adhered areas 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 while the internal one has 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.080
 protein filaments that make up the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080
 fibrous sheet 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.160
 the content of the core called 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.829
 plasma core is formed by a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.860
 colloidal solution composed of a large 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.649
 variety of immediate principles 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.030
 especially nucleotides and files 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.449
 involved in the transcription and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.210
 replication of the belle in those in this 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.030
 solution are chromatin and 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.690
 core all fight to is an aggregate 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.560
 of DNA and proteins of small size 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 called stories 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.900
 during the stages of the cell cycle the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.620
 chromatin presents different levels of 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.020
 compaction 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.390
 the first level consists of the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.360
 water association with a lawyer 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 protein of the resulting nuclei 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.130
 or more 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.570
 the structure they form receives a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 name of pearl necklace 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.770
 during the second compaction model 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.259
 the fiber receives the name of solenoid 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.810
 the fiber keeps rolling on itself 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.689
 same in successive levels until adopting 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.869
 the form of how soma that corresponds to 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.719
 fifth and last level of compaction the 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.270
 penis is the carrier of the genetic message 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.209
 of each individual is responsible for 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.049
 transmit from generation to generation 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.770
 a whole series of features 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.619
 morphological and physiological 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.600
 but deoxyribonucleic acid is found 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.710
 in the nucleus of any cell of the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 living beings 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.840
 in the molecular structure of DNA is 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.619
 a double helix formed by two chains 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:16.100
 anti-parallel nucleotides these are 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:19.130
 they make up the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.650
 of tocine cotinine 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.570
 both chains are joined by points of 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.140
 hydrogen that are established between 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.140
 nitrogenous bases 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.490
 due to the existing complementarity 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.920
 between these bases the adenine can only 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.590
 join the thymine but it makes it possible to 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.630
 the guanine from the multiple 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 possible combinations between these 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.830
 Four nitrogenous bases are structured 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.010
 the genetic information of each 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.010
 individual
