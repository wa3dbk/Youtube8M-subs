00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.790
 it rained sexual 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.389
 hi i am wired and be cameron 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.900
 clicks on sexual rain and then it was 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.500
 possessed by the number 25 the letter in 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.270
 125 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.690
 I think I'll play the lightning spell card 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.689
 night now that's not good it's not 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.670
 for you but yes for me because I can 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.080
 choose one of your cards face down and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.600
 destroy it then the letter will choose 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.600
 I think I'll choose the one on the right 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.660
 destroyed goodbye damage after summoned to the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 scandal hunter 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.690
 unfortunately now I have two 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.539
 less cards in my hand and camera club 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.699
 loses 800 attack points but it is still 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.579
 enough for a big hit or in this 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.180
 camera case chief camera attacks the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.180
 ax archer 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 and now get ready for the approach 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.310
 because the scandal hunter is attacking you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310
 directly 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100
 and still not finished you must know the 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.130
 Special skill of the hunter of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.170
 scandals you'll see causes you damage accelerates 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.110
 your level in two and change so 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.710
 attack to defense mode after active 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.780
 the letter spell frame exists my hand 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.970
 this means that on your next turn 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.910
 you can not attack with a monster that does not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.500
 is there are movements of shots 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:45.770
 perfect and talking about shots at the end 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.619
 we come to the fifth shift and how do you 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.040
 I showed before is during that fifth turn 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.680
 where you invoke autopÃ­a and then you lose 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.990
 in the sixth 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.560
 well my character is passionate about 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.230
 the photograph that one day is 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.990
 a letter number and that makes it 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.900
 possess and be another very character 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.640
 damn with the ones with the opponents and 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.220
 that does not recognize his friends 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.209
 I think this really cool experience 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.680
 I had never recorded anything and a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.880
 very difficult character because he had 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.470
 many changes of pace then but 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.470
 it was a father experience I liked 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.650
 Cameron seriously, you still do that, I think 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.440
 it's a habit guys sorry I'm sorry 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.860
 everything I did will be able to 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.230
 forgive me is fine yes I think we should 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.680
 blame that sinister letter and not you 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.150

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.150
