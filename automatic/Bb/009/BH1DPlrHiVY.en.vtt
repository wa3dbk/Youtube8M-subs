00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:11.480
 Now that the Governor what he 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:14.990
 I do not have the money, so I can not free me. 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.369
 I do not have money and I can not 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:23.779
 Nin did not even care about money or that 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.340
 If you do not have money, you can not 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.199
 If I did not actually have the money , 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.309
 And sufficient empathy 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.890
 Try to write that I mean anything to convince one to sleep in the sense that they 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.970
 If you lack a little , things get bigger. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.600
 I do not actually have it. I can not do it. 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.710
 can 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.520
 I do not have to be unconditionally, but I am. 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.690
 It is. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:55.430
 Because it's important to get the best out of the kids in that situation. 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:58.790
 Yes, but what we see in the process is that we do not talk. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.829
 Til the feeling is intensified that's not 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.539
 So now, rather than sticking beak and a complete conclusion is make my 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:12.530
 As we persuade the other party in front of us, 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:16.550
 Best apparent that the reader better to go while gaining the confidence to go 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.179
 What seems to be a past life, I write down a complete answer, even if you have more understanding 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.990
 If you follow me out there , no one will follow you there . 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.340
 I mean, what does not matter now is ice . 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.149
 It depends. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:33.649
 That this right because it depends on the financial situation unconditionally 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:38.450
 If you stick to it, is not it possible that the sea ​​will be destroyed? 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:43.490
 It's more important than having to spend money, and this priority will change. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:48.619
 Because this situation is changing, let's keep it in it. 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 Priority is the most important thing that will continue to judge this later 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.340
 You have to renew it. 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.900
 If you think it is the attitude of party people do live just one 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.890
 Are you the right one. What are you going to do a person claiming any right that you're 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 There is not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.160
 Well
