00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.650
 audi calls in the polo we say 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.990
 9 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.240
 that was the star at the l autoshow and 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.800
 now stand here live on the asphalt 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.340
 and I have the honor to the dare 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.930
 drive 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.660
 That's why I have these too 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.950
 funny painter pink looks especially 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.559
 sexy out but well 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.660
 Safety goes before the highlight 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.610
 getting in is me with one 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 smartphone makes the vehicle recognizable 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.280
 me and my finger two public the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.280
 door and can then go 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.360
 what is under the vehicle that is the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.460
 coming 86 centimeters shorter wheelbase 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.820
 the engine that brabbelt so wonderful here 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.990
 this is the well-known v8 with 605 ps 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.150
 here is another 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.460
 installed exhaust system and therefore can 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.970
 why an American muscle car the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.970
 madness 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 this is still a concept vehicle 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.700
 I can do that but almost like that 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 It does not have to be a production vehicle 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.740
 treat like a raw egg but audi has 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.869
 me your passenger packed in the seat 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 that's my watch and she's too 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.509
 that I do not have the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.890
 make mexican border and me that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.890
 single piece under nail travel 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.759
 the spectacular one here already 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.290
 first look at the new mmmm one 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.990
 latest version we know from the audi 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.369
 tt here it is however in 3d as 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.409
 you have the ever modern tv 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.380
 or in the cinema looks awesome 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.599
 otherwise than mtt will be here 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.220
 Passenger involved is not just 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.290
 tailored to the driver but 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 gran turismo on the driver's 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.590
 just join in here just before 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.390
 also a display 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.220
 about it he can, for example, a 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.050
 navigate route and with fingerprints 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.360
 you know it from the tablet I simply 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.790
 push over so he just did not know well 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 completely uninvolved in the passenger seat 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 seated 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.830
 the center console that's the money like that 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.590
 named led thus an organic led 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.750
 or oled also called that's newer 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.709
 audi says so casually one 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.240
 world premiere 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.620
 because those are led lights without 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.200
 backlight thereby the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 display will also be bent so 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 So my iphone would be broken now 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.780
 this dare of this study that drives 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.200
 Actually , almost like a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.489
 production car clear the gas that is still 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.709
 not really tuned that's why 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.930
 that sometimes jerks a bit and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.360
 also the 22 inch year that left so 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.400
 of course a few rolling sounds here 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.680
 pure but otherwise you have to think 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.049
 you have the vehicle within 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.540
 four and a half months designed and how 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.840
 we were just on the road that was in 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.310
 built only seven weeks and for that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.549
 Madness even very close to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.549
 the reality 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.340
 I'm still very excited because 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.770
 he is already doing really well 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.990
 the butt like a muscle car 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.060
 she drives her quite filigree 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.330
 that works everything here trainer 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.380
 hardly anything crackles and you have to say 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.120
 Respect for being the vehicle 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.590
 within seven weeks so on the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.110
 legs have worked already 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.400
 really good and growing with me 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.230
 Now hope that this 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.060
 concept vehicle then just like that in 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.040
 the series goes and then can also audi 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.040
 say this is the new a 9
