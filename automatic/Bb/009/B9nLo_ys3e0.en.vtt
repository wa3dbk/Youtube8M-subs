holding<00:04:34.870> these<00:04:35.170> two<00:04:35.230> bottles<00:04:35.830> together<00:04:36.150> it's

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
holding these two bottles together it's

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.110 
holding these two bottles together it's
green<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.430> see<00:04:39.610> these<00:04:39.730> things<00:04:39.970> right

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
green and it you see these things right

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.020 
green and it you see these things right
here<00:04:40.270> it's<00:04:40.450> madness<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.760> instead<00:04:42.760> of<00:04:42.820> having

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
here it's madness and instead of having

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.470 
here it's madness and instead of having
to<00:04:43.240> spend<00:04:43.800> $500<00:04:44.800> on<00:04:44.830> one<00:04:45.220> of<00:04:45.250> those<00:04:45.480> vortex

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
to spend $500 on one of those vortex

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.050 
to spend $500 on one of those vortex
machines<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.050> are<00:04:47.170> electric<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:48.250> is<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> $25

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
machines that are electric this is a $25

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.090 
machines that are electric this is a $25
contraption<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.720> can<00:04:49.810> get<00:04:49.990> right<00:04:50.170> now<00:04:50.230> to

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
contraption you can get right now to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.530 
contraption you can get right now to
where<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:52.480> restructures<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.290> water<00:04:53.530> and

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
where it restructures the water and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.970 
where it restructures the water and
which<00:04:55.540> enables<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.200> hydrate<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.770> more

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
which enables it to hydrate you more

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.950 
which enables it to hydrate you more
hopefully<00:04:57.420> additionally<00:04:58.420> since<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.810> has

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
hopefully additionally since it has

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.010 
hopefully additionally since it has
magnets<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.740> has<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.130> capability<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:01.020> erasing

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
magnets it has the capability of erasing

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.040 
magnets it has the capability of erasing
that<00:05:02.640> homeopathic<00:05:03.640> solution<00:05:04.210> memory<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.930> we

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
that homeopathic solution memory that we

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.290 
that homeopathic solution memory that we
needed<00:05:05.200> that<00:05:05.380> nasty<00:05:05.950> stuff<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.310> there<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.060> what

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
needed that nasty stuff in there so what

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.060 
needed that nasty stuff in there so what
you<00:05:07.450> do<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:07.990> like<00:05:08.110> when<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.320> take<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.500> magnet

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
you do it's like when you take a magnet

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.480 
you do it's like when you take a magnet
and<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.190> put<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.490> over<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:10.050> computer<00:05:11.050> or<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.490> VHS

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
and you put it over a computer or a VHS

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.650 
and you put it over a computer or a VHS
tape<00:05:12.520> or<00:05:12.880> something<00:05:13.060> like<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.360> has<00:05:13.510> the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
tape or something like that it has the

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.780 
tape or something like that it has the
potential<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.260> erase<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.130> information<00:05:15.700> on

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
potential to erase the information on

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.880 
potential to erase the information on
there<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.540> can<00:05:16.780> possibly<00:05:17.080> do<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.710> same

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
there and this can possibly do the same

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.430 
there and this can possibly do the same
thing<00:05:18.190> so<00:05:18.669> what<00:05:18.970> you<00:05:19.120> do<00:05:19.360> is<00:05:19.510> you<00:05:19.630> vortex<00:05:20.260> it

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
thing so what you do is you vortex it

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.520 
thing so what you do is you vortex it
from<00:05:20.710> here<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.100> here<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:23.110> want<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.440> do

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
from here to here and you want to do

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.350 
from here to here and you want to do
counterclockwise<00:05:24.130> three<00:05:24.820> times<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.300> that

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
counterclockwise three times and that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.510 
counterclockwise three times and that
kind<00:05:25.630> of<00:05:25.720> erases<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.290> memory<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.040> then<00:05:27.430> you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
kind of erases that memory and then you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.250 
kind of erases that memory and then you
want<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.760> do<00:05:27.850> clockwise<00:05:28.510> four<00:05:28.960> times

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
want to do clockwise four times

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.050 
want to do clockwise four times
afterwards<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:29.979> that<00:05:30.010> just<00:05:30.250> restructures<00:05:30.910> it

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
afterwards and that just restructures it

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.610 
afterwards and that just restructures it
and<00:05:31.210> you've<00:05:31.300> got<00:05:31.419> structured<00:05:31.930> water<00:05:32.169> which

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
and you've got structured water which

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.409 
and you've got structured water which
will<00:05:32.740> hydrate<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.190> body<00:05:33.220> more<00:05:33.640> efficiently

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
will hydrate the body more efficiently

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.450 
will hydrate the body more efficiently
hopefully<00:05:34.840> so<00:05:35.320> let's<00:05:35.530> go<00:05:35.680> backwards<00:05:36.160> you<00:05:36.280> just

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
hopefully so let's go backwards you just

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.600 
hopefully so let's go backwards you just
kind<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:36.729> go<00:05:36.880> like<00:05:36.910> this<00:05:38.370> you're<00:05:39.370> supposed<00:05:39.580> to

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
kind of go like this you're supposed to

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.540 
kind of go like this you're supposed to
fill<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:39.880> two-thirds<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.630> way<00:05:40.750> out<00:05:41.550> and

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
fill it two-thirds of the way out and

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.540 
fill it two-thirds of the way out and
check<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:42.940> out

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
check it out

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.920 
check it out
it's<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:45.760> simple<00:05:47.340> hmm<00:05:48.540> it's<00:05:49.540> like<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.690> little

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
it's that simple hmm it's like a little

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.540 
it's that simple hmm it's like a little
cyclone<00:05:50.590> going<00:05:50.979> on<00:05:51.070> in<00:05:51.190> there

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
cyclone going on in there

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.000 
cyclone going on in there
yeah<00:05:54.810> we<00:05:55.810> just<00:05:55.840> restructure<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:56.560> water<00:05:56.740> you

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
yeah we just restructure the water you

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.580 
yeah we just restructure the water you
bring<00:05:57.190> it<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.370> other<00:05:57.490> side<00:05:58.290> you<00:05:59.290> might<00:05:59.440> not

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
bring it the other side you might not

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.960 
bring it the other side you might not
want<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.800> fill<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.040> up<00:06:00.100> as<00:06:00.250> much<00:06:00.460> so<00:06:00.729> you<00:06:00.790> don't

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
want to fill it up as much so you don't

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.390 
want to fill it up as much so you don't
have<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:01.210> there<00:06:02.050> we<00:06:02.169> go<00:06:02.290> I<00:06:02.740> guess<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.070> did<00:06:03.220> do<00:06:03.310> it

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
have to there we go I guess I did do it

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.159 
have to there we go I guess I did do it
right<00:06:03.550> look<00:06:03.729> at<00:06:03.820> that<00:06:03.940> do<00:06:04.690> you<00:06:04.720> have<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:05.050> use

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
right look at that do you have to use

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.159 
right look at that do you have to use
these<00:06:05.410> glass<00:06:05.710> bottles<00:06:06.150> actually<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.930> best

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
these glass bottles actually the best

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.719 
these glass bottles actually the best
type<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.500> bottles<00:06:08.950> that<00:06:09.010> these<00:06:09.220> were<00:06:09.340> actually

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
type of bottles that these were actually

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.250 
type of bottles that these were actually
not<00:06:09.880> meant<00:06:10.180> for<00:06:10.270> glass<00:06:10.570> bottles<00:06:10.990> they<00:06:11.200> were

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
not meant for glass bottles they were

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.250 
not meant for glass bottles they were
meant<00:06:11.650> for<00:06:11.770> you<00:06:12.370> know<00:06:13.360> those<00:06:13.510> like<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:14.050> best

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
meant for you know those like the best

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.620 
meant for you know those like the best
kind<00:06:14.470> of<00:06:14.500> do<00:06:14.620> are<00:06:14.710> the<00:06:14.860> Smart<00:06:15.310> Water<00:06:15.630> 2-liter

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
kind of do are the Smart Water 2-liter

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.840 
kind of do are the Smart Water 2-liter
jugs<00:06:16.960> that<00:06:17.050> you<00:06:17.200> get<00:06:17.350> from<00:06:17.620> the<00:06:17.950> store<00:06:18.160> I'm

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
jugs that you get from the store I'm

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.080 
jugs that you get from the store I'm
it's<00:06:19.090> usually<00:06:19.330> distilled<00:06:19.690> water<00:06:19.840> um<00:06:20.880> it's<00:06:21.880> not

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
it's usually distilled water um it's not

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.089 
it's usually distilled water um it's not
meant<00:06:22.330> for<00:06:22.390> glass<00:06:22.750> it<00:06:23.080> can<00:06:23.260> actually<00:06:23.410> leak<00:06:23.919> a

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
meant for glass it can actually leak a

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.500 
meant for glass it can actually leak a
little<00:06:24.370> bit<00:06:24.490> if<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:24.640> use<00:06:24.849> glass<00:06:25.120> like<00:06:25.330> this

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
little bit if you use glass like this

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.249 
little bit if you use glass like this
like<00:06:25.690> we

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
like we

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.950 
like we
but<00:06:27.130> I'd<00:06:27.580> rather<00:06:27.759> use<00:06:28.000> glass<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.449> plastic<00:06:28.840> and

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
but I'd rather use glass and plastic and

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.200 
but I'd rather use glass and plastic and
I'm<00:06:29.020> I'm<00:06:29.979> okay<00:06:30.460> with<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.729> leaking<00:06:30.940> just<00:06:31.150> a

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
I'm I'm okay with it leaking just a

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.749 
I'm I'm okay with it leaking just a
little<00:06:31.479> bit<00:06:31.630> on<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.810> sides<00:06:32.039> so<00:06:33.039> we<00:06:33.520> just<00:06:33.610> use

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
little bit on the sides so we just use

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.540 
little bit on the sides so we just use
glass<00:06:34.030> so<00:06:34.840> if<00:06:34.990> it's<00:06:35.199> on<00:06:35.350> like<00:06:35.590> one<00:06:36.009> liter<00:06:36.280> or

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
glass so if it's on like one liter or

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.260 
glass so if it's on like one liter or
two<00:06:36.789> liter

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
two liter

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.270 
two liter
if<00:06:37.720> it's<00:06:37.900> on<00:06:38.020> anything<00:06:38.259> that<00:06:38.440> has<00:06:38.620> screw<00:06:39.100> top

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
if it's on anything that has screw top

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.860 
if it's on anything that has screw top
like<00:06:39.460> that<00:06:39.669> and<00:06:40.389> you<00:06:40.449> want<00:06:40.600> to<00:06:40.630> fill<00:06:40.780> it

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
like that and you want to fill it

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.749 
like that and you want to fill it
two-thirds<00:06:41.289> of<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.500> way<00:06:41.620> up<00:06:41.650> and<00:06:42.130> now<00:06:42.490> we<00:06:42.550> did

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 
two-thirds of the way up and now we did

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:43.920 
two-thirds of the way up and now we did
that<00:06:42.880> three<00:06:43.150> times<00:06:43.180> now<00:06:43.660> we're<00:06:43.810> gonna

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
that three times now we're gonna

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.070 
that three times now we're gonna
structure<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:44.440> this<00:06:44.590> way<00:06:46.949> so<00:06:47.949> yeah<00:06:48.100> now<00:06:48.310> we're

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
structure it this way so yeah now we're

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.740 
structure it this way so yeah now we're
so<00:06:50.080> simple<00:06:50.500> and<00:06:51.370> yeah<00:06:51.850> it's<00:06:52.120> one<00:06:52.330> twentieth

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
so simple and yeah it's one twentieth

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.350 
so simple and yeah it's one twentieth
the<00:06:52.960> price<00:06:53.199> of<00:06:53.620> one<00:06:54.190> of<00:06:54.220> those<00:06:54.370> five<00:06:55.240> hundred

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
the price of one of those five hundred

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.080 
the price of one of those five hundred
dollar<00:06:55.660> vitalize<00:06:56.820> vortex<00:06:57.820> machines<00:06:58.470> and<00:07:00.090> can

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
dollar vitalize vortex machines and can

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.570 
dollar vitalize vortex machines and can
you<00:07:01.270> taste<00:07:01.509> the<00:07:01.660> difference<00:07:04.620> I<00:07:05.620> don't<00:07:06.220> know<00:07:06.400> if

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
you taste the difference I don't know if

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.920 
you taste the difference I don't know if
I<00:07:06.669> can<00:07:06.729> necessarily<00:07:07.030> chase<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.570> difference

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
I can necessarily chase the difference

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.370 
I can necessarily chase the difference
okay<00:07:09.360> well<00:07:10.360> first<00:07:10.539> up<00:07:10.720> I'm<00:07:10.840> just<00:07:10.870> playing<00:07:11.289> with

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
okay well first up I'm just playing with

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.320 
okay well first up I'm just playing with
this<00:07:11.949> is<00:07:12.039> actually<00:07:12.340> supreme<00:07:12.699> water<00:07:12.910> right<00:07:13.180> now

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
this is actually supreme water right now

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.379 
this is actually supreme water right now
and<00:07:14.250> I'm<00:07:15.250> sure<00:07:15.310> doctoring<00:07:15.669> spring<00:07:15.940> water<00:07:16.120> even

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
and I'm sure doctoring spring water even

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.629 
and I'm sure doctoring spring water even
more<00:07:16.539> I<00:07:16.570> guess<00:07:16.919> this<00:07:17.919> is<00:07:18.009> pointless<00:07:18.340> if<00:07:18.550> you're

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
more I guess this is pointless if you're

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.950 
more I guess this is pointless if you're
honest<00:07:18.789> with<00:07:18.820> you<00:07:19.000> but<00:07:19.449> if<00:07:19.599> we<00:07:19.690> were<00:07:19.810> using

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
honest with you but if we were using

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.409 
honest with you but if we were using
reverse<00:07:20.410> osmosis<00:07:20.530> this<00:07:21.340> is<00:07:21.430> where<00:07:21.820> seriously

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
reverse osmosis this is where seriously

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.310 
reverse osmosis this is where seriously
be<00:07:22.570> doing<00:07:22.900> it<00:07:23.080> and<00:07:24.389> my<00:07:25.389> water<00:07:25.630> taste<00:07:25.960> buds<00:07:26.169> are

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
be doing it and my water taste buds are

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.719 
be doing it and my water taste buds are
so<00:07:26.440> different<00:07:26.860> from<00:07:27.130> link<00:07:27.400> drinking<00:07:27.639> of

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729 
so different from link drinking of

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:28.770 
so different from link drinking of
spring<00:07:27.940> water<00:07:28.090> I<00:07:28.210> wouldn't<00:07:28.449> be<00:07:28.509> able<00:07:28.570> to<00:07:28.660> tell

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
spring water I wouldn't be able to tell

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.029 
spring water I wouldn't be able to tell
you<00:07:28.870> right<00:07:28.960> now<00:07:29.020> but<00:07:29.470> I<00:07:29.500> think<00:07:29.590> when<00:07:29.889> I<00:07:29.919> was

doing<00:07:30.370> I<00:07:30.520> definitely<00:07:30.940> noticed<00:07:31.150> a<00:07:31.210> difference

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:31.539 
doing I definitely noticed a difference
