scoping in modern warfare 3 there's a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.209 
scoping in modern warfare 3 there's a
lot<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.800> videos<00:00:11.160> out<00:00:11.340> there<00:00:11.840> honestly<00:00:13.190> some<00:00:14.190> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
lot of videos out there honestly some of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.060 
lot of videos out there honestly some of
them<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.580> bullshit<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> other<00:00:15.360> day<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> saw

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
them are bullshit the other day I saw

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.510 
them are bullshit the other day I saw
some<00:00:17.070> guy<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.170> his<00:00:19.170> video<00:00:19.590> was<00:00:19.770> talking<00:00:20.250> about

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
some guy and his video was talking about

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.779 
some guy and his video was talking about
using<00:00:21.050> kick<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.529> MSR<00:00:23.310> which<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
using kick with MSR which is a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
using kick with MSR which is a
bolt-action<00:00:24.390> rifle<00:00:25.109> which<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.949> most

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
bolt-action rifle which is just the most

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.960 
bolt-action rifle which is just the most
useless<00:00:26.930> sniper<00:00:27.930> proficiency<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
useless sniper proficiency so what I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.799 
useless sniper proficiency so what I
recommend<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.890> MSR<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.210> LA<00:00:33.540> tène

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
recommend is use MSR or the LA tène

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.590 
recommend is use MSR or the LA tène
whichever<00:00:34.350> one<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.219> best<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.969> would

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
whichever one you like the best I would

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.959 
whichever one you like the best I would
use<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.230> proficiency<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> would<00:00:38.190> use<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.790> out

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
use the proficiency I would use is out

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.280 
use the proficiency I would use is out
of<00:00:39.000> stability<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:40.140> speed<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of stability or speed and one of the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.030 
of stability or speed and one of the
reasons<00:00:43.620> actually

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
reasons actually

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
reasons actually
I<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.820> using<00:00:45.090> MSR<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.809> LA<00:00:46.230> tène<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> fact

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I like using MSR and LA tène is the fact

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
I like using MSR and LA tène is the fact
that<00:00:47.250> they're<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.700> mobile<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that they're very mobile and as a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
that they're very mobile and as a
quickscoper<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.160> quick<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
quickscoper you need to be quick you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
quickscoper you need to be quick you
can't<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.300> using<00:00:51.660> barrettes<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> shit<00:00:52.649> they

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
can't be using barrettes and shit they

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.939 
can't be using barrettes and shit they
have<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.949> low<00:00:53.190> mobility<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.079> speed

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
have a low mobility you know and speed

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.680 
have a low mobility you know and speed
will<00:00:56.160> help<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.870> just<00:00:57.870> maneuver<00:00:58.500> quicker<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
will help you just maneuver quicker and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
will help you just maneuver quicker and
stability<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.750> awesome<00:01:01.350> too<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.770> actually<00:01:02.039> go

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
stability is awesome too I actually go

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570 
stability is awesome too I actually go
back<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.000> forth<00:01:03.270> between<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:04.580> stability

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
back and forth between the two stability

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
back and forth between the two stability
makes<00:01:05.850> less<00:01:06.240> waste<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> especially<00:01:07.350> when

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
makes less waste and especially when

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
makes less waste and especially when
you're<00:01:07.799> aiming<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.880> towards<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you're aiming it's more towards the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.070 
you're aiming it's more towards the
center<00:01:10.369> for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> secondary<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
center for the secondary I would use the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
center for the secondary I would use the
akimbo<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:15.420> fmg<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.350> scorpion<00:01:16.979> whatever<00:01:17.400> it's

akimbo for fmg or scorpion whatever it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.969 
akimbo for fmg or scorpion whatever it's
quick<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.360> kills<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> job<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.500> you'll

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
quick it kills it as a job and you'll

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.499 
quick it kills it as a job and you'll
need<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.430> close<00:01:20.820> combat<00:01:22.790> for<00:01:23.790> lethal<00:01:24.030> I

camping way I like to put them on the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.539 
camping way I like to put them on the
side<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.790> map<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.619> I<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> side

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
side of a map so I know I have that side

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
side of a map so I know I have that side
a<00:01:35.579> map<00:01:35.939> covered<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.840> focus<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a map covered and I can focus on the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.080 
a map covered and I can focus on the
other<00:01:38.009> section<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.420> map<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:41.790> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
other section of the map and this just

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.530 
other section of the map and this just
makes<00:01:42.450> me<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.850> more<00:01:44.850> relieved<00:01:45.240> knowing

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
makes me kind of more relieved knowing

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.530 
makes me kind of more relieved knowing
that<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.700> see<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that I will know I will see what is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.050 
that I will know I will see what is
gonna<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:49.979> opponents<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.640> gonna<00:01:50.729> come

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
gonna or if any opponents are gonna come

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
gonna or if any opponents are gonna come
from<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.479> side<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> map<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:53.100> find<00:01:53.549> it

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
from one side of the map and I find it

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.149 
from one side of the map and I find it
useful<00:01:53.850> other<00:01:54.570> times<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.200> Rock<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.890> knife

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
useful other times I just Rock the knife

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.270 
useful other times I just Rock the knife
and<00:01:56.600> go<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> concussion<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> really

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and go with the concussion so it really

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
and go with the concussion so it really
depends<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.200> this

depends on what you like I like this

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.219 
depends on what you like I like this
