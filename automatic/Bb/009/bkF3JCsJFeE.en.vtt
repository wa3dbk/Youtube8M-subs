00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.529 
zoey is going to show us how to me a
check<00:00:14.190> so<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.369> first<00:00:15.610> thing<00:00:15.730> we<00:00:16.059> want<00:00:16.240> to<00:00:16.360> do

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
check so the first thing we want to do

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.810 
check so the first thing we want to do
is<00:00:16.780> we<00:00:16.930> want<00:00:16.960> to<00:00:17.140> bring<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.410> boil<00:00:18.190> about<00:00:18.789> a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
is we want to bring to boil about a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.700 
is we want to bring to boil about a
gallon<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.390> water<00:00:19.630> this<00:00:19.930> parts<00:00:20.199> a<00:00:20.320> little<00:00:20.350> bit

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
gallon of water this parts a little bit

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.800 
gallon of water this parts a little bit
larger<00:00:21.100> so<00:00:21.130> just<00:00:21.850> measure<00:00:22.090> out<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.360> gallon

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
larger so just measure out a gallon

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.890 
larger so just measure out a gallon
which<00:00:22.930> is<00:00:23.110> four<00:00:23.470> liters<00:00:23.910> once<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.540> water<00:00:25.780> is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
which is four liters once the water is

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.900 
which is four liters once the water is
boiled<00:00:26.350> and<00:00:26.710> cools<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.190> little<00:00:27.460> bit<00:00:27.610> we're

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
boiled and cools a little bit we're

to be sugar them and actually refined

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.610 
to be sugar them and actually refined
sugar<00:00:40.120> seems<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.749> do<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:40.899> little<00:00:41.230> bit<00:00:41.440> better

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
sugar seems to do a little bit better

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.239 
sugar seems to do a little bit better
with<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.070> culture<00:00:42.339> right<00:00:42.789> not<00:00:43.269> um<00:00:43.859> like<00:00:44.859> over

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.249 
with the culture right not um like over

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:47.669 
with the culture right not um like over
fine<00:00:45.489> you<00:00:45.760> can<00:00:45.909> do<00:00:45.999> as<00:00:46.179> sugar<00:00:46.480> cane<00:00:46.780> okay

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
fine you can do as sugar cane okay

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.829 
fine you can do as sugar cane okay
evaporated<00:00:48.370> about<00:00:48.789> like<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:49.030> coconut<00:00:49.300> palm

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
evaporated about like a coconut palm

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.479 
evaporated about like a coconut palm
sugar<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:50.409> everyone<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:50.829> going<00:00:50.859> crazy<00:00:51.129> over

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
sugar that everyone is going crazy over

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.149 
sugar that everyone is going crazy over
a<00:00:51.940> triumph<00:00:52.899> yeah<00:00:53.229> i<00:00:53.260> think<00:00:53.530> it's<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.890> more

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
a triumph yeah i think it's the more

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:59.520 
a triumph yeah i think it's the more
minerals<00:00:57.159> or<00:00:57.429> nutrients<00:00:58.059> in<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.659> sugar<00:00:58.929> the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
minerals or nutrients in the sugar the

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.410 
minerals or nutrients in the sugar the
more<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> kombucha<00:01:00.219> has<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.639> process<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.239> get

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
more the kombucha has to process to get

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.389 
more the kombucha has to process to get
to<00:01:01.659> what<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:01.899> wants<00:01:02.199> that's<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.100> little<00:01:03.309> bit

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
to what it wants that's a little bit

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.070 
to what it wants that's a little bit
easier<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:03.819> to<00:01:03.940> use<00:01:04.030> like<00:01:04.420> me<00:01:04.570> back<00:01:04.720> rated

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
easier just to use like me back rated
