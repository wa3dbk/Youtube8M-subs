00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
not as good the problem is that the

not as good the problem is that the

will slowly pan over and it's very

disoriented offensively it's much better

a<00:02:55.510> quarterback<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.320> coordinate<00:02:56.770> very<00:02:57.100> well

a quarterback and coordinate very well

wide<00:02:58.930> receiver<00:02:59.320> for<00:02:59.830> example<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.430> much

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
wide receiver for example it's much

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.340 
wide receiver for example it's much
easier<00:03:00.700> for<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.240> wide<00:03:01.420> receiver<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.960> carve<00:03:02.200> his

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
easier for a wide receiver to carve his

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.680

own path and go for an easy catch co-op
is<00:03:04.810> an<00:03:04.930> interesting<00:03:05.140> idea<00:03:05.410> but<00:03:05.890> EA<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.460> going

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
is an interesting idea but EA is going

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.920 
is an interesting idea but EA is going
to<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> fix<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.240> camera<00:03:07.420> angle<00:03:07.690> on

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
to have to fix the camera angle on

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.080 
to have to fix the camera angle on
defense<00:03:08.290> in<00:03:08.950> addition<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.520> those<00:03:09.610> two<00:03:09.820> modes

defense in addition to those two modes

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.700 
defense in addition to those two modes
there<00:03:10.480> are<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> lot<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.230> tweaks<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
there are a lot of little tweaks to the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.920 
there are a lot of little tweaks to the
gameplay<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.370> make<00:03:12.580> for<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.820> better<00:03:12.910> Matt<00:03:13.210> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
gameplay that make for a better Matt the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.540 
gameplay that make for a better Matt the
gameplay<00:03:14.170> has<00:03:14.440> been<00:03:14.620> slowed<00:03:14.950> down<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.460> you

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
gameplay has been slowed down so you

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.010 
gameplay has been slowed down so you
have<00:03:15.640> more<00:03:15.790> time<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.120> make<00:03:16.240> decisions<00:03:16.720> in<00:03:16.840> pull

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
have more time to make decisions in pull

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.290 
have more time to make decisions in pull
off<00:03:17.140> moves<00:03:17.440> actually<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.490> this<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.940> makes<00:03:19.120> it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
off moves actually like this it makes it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.790 
off moves actually like this it makes it
less<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> video<00:03:19.900> game<00:03:20.020> and<00:03:20.260> more<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:20.710> the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
less like a video game and more like the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.950 
less like a video game and more like the
real<00:03:20.920> thing<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.880> blocking<00:03:22.270> system<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.690> also

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
real thing the blocking system is also

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.750 
real thing the blocking system is also
much<00:03:23.200> better<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.920> quarterback<00:03:24.310> can<00:03:24.490> actually

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
much better the quarterback can actually

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.370 
much better the quarterback can actually
step<00:03:24.940> into<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.240> pocket<00:03:25.570> now<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.960> controlling
