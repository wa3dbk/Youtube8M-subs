00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
so many in the armor for a reason it's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.179 
so many in the armor for a reason it's
not<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.240> looks<00:01:42.799> I'll<00:01:43.799> show<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
not just for looks I'll show you the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
not just for looks I'll show you the
male<00:01:44.310> version<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> second<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.360> overall<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
male version in a second but overall I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.710 
male version in a second but overall I
think<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> looks<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.490> perfect<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
think this looks pretty much perfect it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.450 
think this looks pretty much perfect it
just<00:01:48.750> needs<00:01:49.170> some<00:01:49.530> things<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.159> clipping

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just needs some things like clipping

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
just needs some things like clipping
soaring<00:01:50.820> out<00:01:50.939> bump<00:01:51.240> shot<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.600> happen<00:01:51.899> and
