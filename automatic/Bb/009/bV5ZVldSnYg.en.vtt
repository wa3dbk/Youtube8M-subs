high<00:00:23.580> now<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.000> could<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.330> two<00:00:24.510> things<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.840> could

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
high now we could do two things we could

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.839 
high now we could do two things we could
cut<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> fork<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.830> could<00:00:25.980> add<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> headset

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
cut the fork or we could add a headset

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.259 
cut the fork or we could add a headset
spacer<00:00:27.359> underneath<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.400> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
spacer underneath here so that it can be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
spacer underneath here so that it can be
resting<00:00:30.779> somewhere<00:00:31.170> right<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.380> there<00:00:31.590> okay

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
resting somewhere right in there okay

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.620 
resting somewhere right in there okay
that's<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.719> use<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.230> spacers<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.630> did

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that's what we use the spacers for did
