00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.530
 the first part of the video we tied the bottom 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 hats 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.279
 in the second part we will knit 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.019
 crown height hats need to be 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.750
 knit by like bottom 15 and a half 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:34.400
 about 19 diagnoses and a half 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.559
 18 and a half centimeters in height 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 visit we will be as follows we 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 will repeat the first one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 second row and so knit 3 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 lift air loops 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.239
 this we have with you who knits together with 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.250
 I get the same diameter 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 now we will have to go 9 9 circular 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.160
 knit 3 lift air loops 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.740
 further under the chain of 2 air loops 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:14.700
 and we are going to knit two columns with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:18.439
 one nap over the post with one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 we crochet a column with one crochet and 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.659
 so we will continue to alternate the chain 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 knit two columns with one single crochet 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.750
 and above the single crochet 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.780
 we knit a column with one nakida and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.930
 so we will repeat to the end 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.930
 circular row 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.500
 knit in a circle knotted to the end 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.659
 row as usual join 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.990
 connecting loop 3 air loop 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.990
 lifting 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.739
 the next 10 circle series will be 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.590
 knit also as we knit 8 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.280
 circle of will 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:21.230
 3 lift air loops 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 then 2 cape air loops and 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.380
 skipping two loops i.e. two bars 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.010
 with one previous match 3 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.700
 we enter a hook and we knit a column with 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.959
 one crochet then knit 2 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 cape air loops here we are 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.280
 miss 2 loops again and in the third 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.950
 we enter a hook and we knit a column with 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:03:01.139
 one crochet and so will alternate 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:03.690
 until the end of the circular row with one column 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.680
 nakida 2 air loops here two 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 loops skip 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:14.030
 we knit in a circle until the end of the round 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.030
 and ending in a circular row 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.019
 connect the beginning and the end as they say about 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:30.840
 connecting loop now continue 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:36.349
 knit alternating the 9th and 10th rows of knit on that 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.349
 the height of the cap that we need 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.910
 so we knit with you height 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:50.370
 necessary for our hat for me 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.790
 it turned out well about 19 19 s 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.990
 half a centimeter and now get down 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.520
 to knitting 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:03.120
 peak and meet in the third part 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.120
 video
