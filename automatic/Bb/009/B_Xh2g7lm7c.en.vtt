00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.050
 Schiphol actually from my youth me 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.920
 on your bike you rode through the forest 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.180
 plan like thomson forest and eat earlier 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.989
 they went to Schiphol airplanes 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.390
 look 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.250
 the buzz of the international 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.980
 we have always drawn that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.830
 i also worked as a stuart in my 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.480
 student time and I enjoyed it 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.309
 was very nice all those nationalities 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 because I have recovered 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.320
 when i got my pharmacy here in 2009 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.860
 that jan there was way too small there could 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.600
 I couldn't put my egg in it, I can 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.670
 also the people don't give the service to that 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.840
 they are the ones they needed 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.000
 For example, we have here a 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.590
 speak to seeing so as the people 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.100
 want to have a private conversation in all 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.720
 privacy 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 we can do that we will do it too 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 for health checks and for 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.360
 all kinds of other investigations that we do 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.580
 like to do there like testing on sugar 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.240
 testing on all sorts of other things so that we 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.860
 a 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.369
 that task that we have as a pharmacist 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.369
 can fill in 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.789
 upstairs at the dacotahs at the promenade 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.320

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.460
 Schiphol you see the old one 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.119
 then we often go with the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.979
 grandchildren and then one gets 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.119
 ice cream from open-end balloon and then there is 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.439

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.239

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.690
