 drinking water treatment system 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.260
 from trujillo 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.520
 water is a fundamental condition 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.520
 for life without water there is no life 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 until the year 1995 the city of trujillo 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.880
 it was supplied with groundwater but 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 only a part of the population to 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.550
 solve this film deficit the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 special project chavimóchic built 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:56.120
 in 1996 one of the most modern plants 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.120
 of drinking water treatment in the country 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.910
 the water treatment system 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 Trujillo drinking is located in the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.370
 high moche sector 10 minutes south of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.340
 the city and equipped with technology 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.400
 French produces drinking water for the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.580
 consumption of 70% of the population 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.580
 Trujillo 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.060
 potable water processing 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.220
 capture of the waters of the holy river 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.670
 for the production of drinking water is 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.130
 starts at the intake after traveling 150 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.310
 kilometers through the mother canal the water 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.660
 Raw reaches the catchment area 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.450
 constituted by two floodgates 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.900
 conditioned with gratings and gratings 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.150
 roughing whose function is to separate all 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.600
 Floating and trawling materials 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.090
 that come with water at this stage the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.700
 water is presented turbid product of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.979
 sediments of the holy river and then passes 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.140
 by the marshall meter that measures the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.440
 volume of water that enters for its 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 purification 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.380
 first reagents when the water is 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.200
 very cloudy, usually during the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.319
 avenue applies polymer to nyon and ccoo 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.959
 to reduce his shyness by forming 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.050
 heavy labels that are going to be and mentar 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.660
 its particles in the sand catchers the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.730
 water then passes to the work of distribution 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.160
 here the chemical inputs like lime chlorine 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 aluminum sulfate and cationic polymer 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 with the quick mix separate the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.239
 sediments that are dissolved 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.230
 in the water and that you have been giving the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.770
 turbidity eliminating all contamination 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.560
 microbiological 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.050
 by an underground pipe the water 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.900
 enter the two type decanters 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.110
 laminated heterator pools here the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.640
 separation between water and mud 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.520
 obtaining decanted water with a 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.970

 drinking water treatment trujillo 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.830
 has 10 filter units 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.260
 constituted by a layer of gravel and 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.090

 of water the filtering process 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.040
 guarantees that the water quality has 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.810

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.690
 quality standards 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.489
 the microbiological laboratory analyzes

 trujillo in the last 20 years has almost 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.610
 doubled its population then this was 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.030
 the great challenge for the water company 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.720
 trujillo drinking but needed

 source the source was awarded by the project 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:21.520
 chavimóchic this was a very work 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:25.270
 foresight to produce one thousand 250 liters

 the water supply for the city ​​of 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.789
 trujillo at least in the next 30 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.789
 years 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.920
 the water treatment system 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.050
 drinking water from the city of trujillo is one 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.110
 of the greatest social contributions of the 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.970
 chavimóchic irrigation to the development of 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.670
 the region the freedom

 promote private investment in various 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.680
 sectors of the regional economy
