00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
a lot of the reason for choosing
SolidWorks<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.520> well

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
SolidWorks was because it was so well

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
SolidWorks was because it was so well
supported<00:01:57.210> within<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> community<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.619> knew

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
supported within the community they knew

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
supported within the community they knew
that<00:01:59.189> there<00:01:59.399> was<00:01:59.520> gonna<00:01:59.670> there<00:02:00.240> were<00:02:00.360> gonna<00:02:00.479> be

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that there was gonna there were gonna be

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.109 
that there was gonna there were gonna be
a<00:02:00.719> lot<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> challenges<00:02:01.520> building<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> boat<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
a lot of challenges building a boat this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.230 
a lot of challenges building a boat this
size<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.780> have<00:02:04.500> complex<00:02:05.250> geometry<00:02:05.880> mixed

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
size and you have complex geometry mixed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.139 
size and you have complex geometry mixed
with<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.659> large<00:02:07.079> amounts<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> data<00:02:08.149> piping

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
with a large amounts of data piping

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
with a large amounts of data piping
systems<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.780> lot<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.110> different<00:02:10.410> systems<00:02:10.709> are

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
systems a lot of different systems are

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.840 
systems a lot of different systems are
used<00:02:11.129> inside<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.940> boat<00:02:12.330> so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
used inside the boat so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.050 
used inside the boat so
brought<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.330> lot<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.750> modeling<00:02:14.170> challenges

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
brought on a lot of modeling challenges

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.790 
brought on a lot of modeling challenges
but<00:02:16.060> they<00:02:16.330> knew<00:02:16.540> having<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.350> community

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
but they knew having the the community

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.250 
but they knew having the the community
support<00:02:18.280> was<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> be<00:02:18.880> big<00:02:19.150> d<00:02:19.840> drawings

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.860 
support was going to be big d drawings
have<00:02:20.440> been<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> really<00:02:21.610> great<00:02:21.910> communication

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
have been a really great communication

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.550 
have been a really great communication
tool<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.170> us<00:02:23.560> we've<00:02:24.550> been<00:02:24.760> able<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.320> take<00:02:26.320> the

the models that we're creating and not
having<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.920> fully<00:02:30.250> detail<00:02:30.820> all<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
having to fully detail all the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.050 
having to fully detail all the
assemblies<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.800> give<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
assemblies we can give that to the to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.120 
assemblies we can give that to the to
the<00:02:34.150> wood<00:02:34.360> shop<00:02:34.600> or<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:34.960> interior<00:02:35.530> shop<00:02:35.860> and

the wood shop or the interior shop and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.100 
the wood shop or the interior shop and
then<00:02:36.730> they'll<00:02:36.940> take<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.360> model<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:37.990> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
then they'll take the model do the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.470 
then they'll take the model do the
nesting<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.890> CNC<00:02:39.340> operations<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
nesting do the CNC operations on it and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.050 
nesting do the CNC operations on it and

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
look at the the e drawing model to see

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.360 
look at the the e drawing model to see

its perspective they can then say we

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.290 
its perspective they can then say we
want<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.620> satin<00:03:06.310> finish<00:03:06.670> over<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.270> a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
want to satin finish over here and a

want to satin finish over here and a
leather<00:03:07.540> here<00:03:07.960> we've<00:03:08.380> taken<00:03:08.770> advantage<00:03:09.280> of

leather here we've taken advantage of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.160 
leather here we've taken advantage of
the<00:03:09.820> properties<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.300> SolidWorks<00:03:10.840> allows

the properties that SolidWorks allows
you<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.470> use<00:03:11.710> in<00:03:11.980> each<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.730> models<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.270> in

you to use in each of the models and in
