 fall with relationship 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.789
 was when before the first time i go no 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.039
 was 13 years old there is all the information in the first 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 my video there I told some 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 favorite diet okay I'll say 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.469
 first it was tomato second question 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 as relates to vegetarianism 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.090
 neutral 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 I myself have not tried and do not want a third 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 the issue of losing weight was more difficult 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 start a diet or even these children and me 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 it was harder to hold weight 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 scary if you make food and stop 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 sit on a diet over there that I was afraid 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.260
 To gain weight 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 when licked off I started to eat like 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160
 sleep and weight flew up and then I again 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.059
 went on a diet and so here is shorter 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 vicious circle 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.629

 stand to the end whether you still stand 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.360
 7 question what is your favorite dude 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 I rarely drink tea in rare cases 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.670
 because I just declare and coffee lover and 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.470
 They teach you only when 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.330
 coffee ends if you imagine that 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.459
 I ran out of coffee then I will choose 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.459
 milky because he has such 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.019
 caramel or juicy taste of his cues 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.880
 q8 question have people become from their 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.040
 environment treat you better than 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.739
 for weight loss and what has changed in their 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.720
 behavior if changed at all for it 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.690
 I love my friends not at all 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.299
 attitude towards me has not changed everything 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.769
 my friends left me 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:38.349
 loved and plump and fat and thinner and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.360
 in Houdini they loved me so it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.489
 love and I kind of love them that way or 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.440
 beloved love in general that is and in 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.209
 nothing has changed in their behavior 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.709
 attitude is not like stones has changed 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.569
 the ninth question after you 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.239
 lost weight was difficult to pick up clothes 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.099
 us a new figure is actually losing weight 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.930
 in the hoard of choice of clothes incredibly 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.930
 made my life easier because I was 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.630
 I was still short before they were full and I 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.030
 chose jeans to match me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.470
 what even got into them 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.819
 huge sizes and accordingly they 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.010
 were very long they had to 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.319
 constantly hem and it was adam 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.569
 simple for 23 hours sonar 8 in the store 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.160
 I could not do without hysterics 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.890
 sweat necessarily 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.359
 from pissing while them there on the world I will find 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.010
 then hem them really now 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.569
 very easy to imagine and that because 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.700
 I just come to the jeans shop 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.760
 I donâ€™t wear small size and they donâ€™t 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.889
 growth and in volume are great very 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 easy to choose clothes with me too 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.430
 Bone question taken how should 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.109
 be a man to interest you 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.209
 what do you appreciate in people that you like 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.130
 people and what's not to like i love very much 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.230
 when people are straightforward but what are they 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.760
 think as they think it is nothing 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.290
 hides from me to interest a person 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.569
 there must be a riddle that is he should not 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.220
 they are all right on a platter I serve 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.050
 love 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.570
 find out for yourself something to look for somehow 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.490
 information to find some kind of zest 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.860
 find too i appreciate people weekend 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.900
 honesty i like honest people and what 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.760
 I don't like it in people when they 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 tied up don't like when me 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.450
 try to please in every way when I'm 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.330
 I understand that the person is just out of the skins 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.600
 climb to make me like somebody 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.310
 like not like these people one 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.350
 again just disgustingly reacted 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.859
 the fact that you shoot the video I shot 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:20.850
 the video spontaneously posted it and said 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.750
 I posted you a video on youtube cool 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.070
 and when began to grow in viewing 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.430
 sacred speed just everyone 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.230
 limit responded exactly that is 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.890
 took for granted the rocks shoot a video 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.260
 not for the body 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.520
 okay that was all i hope you 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.320
 liked this video hope you 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.150
 it was just a little bit I want 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.210
 so you ask me a question and not for me 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.190
 and for my young man ask 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.910
 questions about the relationship if you are 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.700

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.200
