are dual density meaning the center is

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.320 
are dual density meaning the center is
harder<00:00:28.260> than<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.070> outside<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.090> it's

two different ways of putting it on we
got<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:55.200> way<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:57.530> air<00:01:58.530> pressure

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960
