 delicious that is a sand sponge cake 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.470
 although that sand although sand like 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.390

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.809
 ingredients so hurry up I give them 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.720
 a few seconds to take paper and 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.129
 pencil and they will write them all 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.510
 I'll leave them in the box 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.510
 information of this video 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.100
 well here I have 200 grams of 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 butter at room temperature 200 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.729
 grams of butter at temperature 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.600
 environment here I have 100 grams of chuño 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.960
 chuño or potato starch or potato starch 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.130
 as you know it in your country if you fail 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.890
 get the dream or the potato starch or 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.840
 of potatoes can replace these 100 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.560
 grams per 100 grams of corn starch 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.110
 or cornstarch as you know it if not 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.690
 they get the potato starch that they can 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.390
 replace it with 100 grams of starch 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.880
 corn a scene but ideally it's 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.640
 yours 200 grams of flour we are going to occupy 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.600
 also 2 teaspoons of powder 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.830
 bake 2 teaspoons 200 grams of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 granulated sugar we will occupy 5 eggs 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.510
 which will be separated into 5 yolks and 5 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.900
 clear we will also occupy 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.080
 zest of a lemon or failing 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.119
 essence of lemon how am I going to do 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.460
 they can also occupy and this is optional 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.460
 a glass of rum or cognac with a 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.530
 tapita to give another richer flavor 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.840
 but in my case I 'm not going to occupy 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.680
 now let's go to the good step 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.910
 we will start mixing the sugar with the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 butter let's beat it until 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.680
 get well well blanquita 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.659
 first and then we can do it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.999
 manually but we would have to beat 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.840
 more still and if we do not do it with a 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.900
 mixer 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.060
 well the mixture is well white and 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.400
 now we will begin to add the yolks 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.159
 one by one but we're also going to add 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.230
 the lemon zest or in this case the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.329
 lemon lime good then now 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.299
 let's go adding the yolks one by 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.769
 one and we put the yolk beat a little 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.540
 we put the second bud we beat another 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.840
 little bit to finish with all the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.840
 yolks 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 I already have in it to mix the 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.050
 butter the sugar the yolks and the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 essence of lemons if you put 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.580
 lemon zest if they have and if what 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.530
 they want and now we're going to beat the whites 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.160
 and let's beat the snowy ones 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.790
 and I always add a little tip 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.790
 of salt 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.400
 so that they are firm now let's go 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.640
 to beat and we are going to take this to the point of 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640
 snow 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 good in our clear are ready the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.870
 proof of gravity there is not 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.540
 fall is about to snow is not a 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.510
 meringue because it does not have sugar and good 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.489
 Now what we are going to do is add in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.769
 the classes here in our shake more 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.069
 heavy the lightest the heaviest and 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.799
 after we go here I have served the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.970
 powders the flour and the chuño in its case 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.700
 They are busy maizena do the same flour 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.040
 cornstarch and powder feel good and go 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.450
 to go adding once we believe in 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.359
 the clear ones in enveloping form so that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.760
 Do not lose air or at least lose 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.370
 as little as possible we are going to 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.280
 and go adding the flour also very very 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.550
 little by little and mixing in shape 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.550
 envelope 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.150
 well once we have a mixture 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.870
 well homogeneous let's put it in a 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.460
 mold the mold to your liking 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.690
 buttered and floured and we're going 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:47.190
 to take to preheated oven 180 degrees 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.770
 the amount of time about 45 minutes 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.129
 already depending on how the oven is 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.959
 your 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.999
 well I'll finish doing this what 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:58.550
 I put in the oven and when ready 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:05:00.709
 I remove sand was finished then 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.689
 Now what I'm going to do is put 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:09.319
 a little icing sugar or powdered sugar 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.979
 or impalpable sugar and we're going to cut a 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.979
 bit 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:27.790
 good and there is the piece cut as 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:32.430
 you can see it from our sand 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.430
 there it is I show them well 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.500
 to be seen 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.990
 so it was very nice and good I hope 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.689
