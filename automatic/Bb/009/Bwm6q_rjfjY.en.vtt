concert<00:01:07.560> layer<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.210> an

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
concert layer so this is is really an

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
concert layer so this is is really an
impossible<00:01:09.930> story<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.640> because<00:01:11.640> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
impossible story I think because it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
impossible story I think because it's
not<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.780> normal<00:01:12.810> guitarist<00:01:13.680> should

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
not like a normal guitarist should

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 
not like a normal guitarist should
become<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> guitarist<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
become a guitarist so what you think

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.899 
become a guitarist so what you think
contributed<00:01:16.740> heared<00:01:17.310> quick<00:01:17.640> development

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
contributed heared quick development

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.740 
contributed heared quick development
then<00:01:19.130> yes<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.090> whip<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.330> was<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
then yes it was it whip it was a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
then yes it was it whip it was a
completely<00:01:22.350> different<00:01:22.890> story<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.460> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
completely different story because you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
know when you're when you know a lot

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
know when you're when you know a lot
about<00:01:26.009> music<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.780> used<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.320> work<00:01:28.710> with

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
movements are not so different and so it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
stuff I had in my head I was thinking

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.319 
stuff I had in my head I was thinking
like<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.540> singer<00:01:48.960> also<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.790> possible<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
like a singer also so it was possible to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.020 
like a singer also so it was possible to
be<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.079> fast<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.220> being<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
be that fast it's it's not being a

was first master class why I went and in

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.700 
was first master class why I went and in
if<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:20.350> know<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.380> lot<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.770> guitar<00:02:22.460> guitar

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
if we know a lot of guitar guitar

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.950 
if we know a lot of guitar guitar
players<00:02:24.710> also<00:02:25.130> have<00:02:25.430> prejudices<00:02:26.000> saying<00:02:26.420> he's

players also have prejudices saying he's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.810 
players also have prejudices saying he's
too<00:02:27.170> much<00:02:27.320> playing<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> audience<00:02:28.370> he's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
too much playing for the audience he's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.670 
too much playing for the audience he's
not<00:02:29.060> going<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.390> play<00:02:29.720> husband<00:02:30.290> enhancer<00:02:30.650> or

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
not going to play husband enhancer or

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000 
not going to play husband enhancer or
whatever<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.510> was<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.140> going<00:02:33.620> there

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
whatever and I was just going there

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.450 
whatever and I was just going there
because<00:02:34.250> he<00:02:35.000> was<00:02:35.800> giving<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.890> master<00:02:37.220> class

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
because he was giving the master class

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.700 
because he was giving the master class
in<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.600> cities<00:02:39.020> where<00:02:39.050> my<00:02:39.320> family

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
in one of the cities where my family

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
in one of the cities where my family
lives<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.270> was<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.780> pure<00:02:42.200> curiosity<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
lives so it was just pure curiosity and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.240 
lives so it was just pure curiosity and
then<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.060> realized<00:02:44.540> he's<00:02:45.170> able<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.950> give<00:02:46.100> me

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
then I realized he's able to give me

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.220 
then I realized he's able to give me
exactly<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.940> what<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.150> want<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.720> then<00:02:48.050> what<00:02:48.200> I

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
exactly that what I want and then what I

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.210 
exactly that what I want and then what I
need<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.330> then<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.570> think<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.020> most<00:02:51.220> important

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
need and then I think the most important

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.870 
need and then I think the most important
thing<00:02:52.280> what<00:02:52.550> he<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.850> give<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.450> um<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.610> you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
thing what he can give is um that you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.360 
thing what he can give is um that you
should<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.690> should<00:02:56.720> never<00:02:57.170> work<00:02:57.890> against<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
should you should never work against the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.850 
should you should never work against the
body<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:59.000> you're<00:02:59.210> doing<00:02:59.350> so<00:03:00.350> that

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
body with what you're doing so that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.770 
body with what you're doing so that
every<00:03:01.220> everything<00:03:01.640> you're<00:03:01.970> doing<00:03:02.120> has<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.630> be

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
every everything you're doing has to be

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.800 
every everything you're doing has to be
in<00:03:03.080> an<00:03:03.320> organic<00:03:03.800> way<00:03:04.300> positive<00:03:05.300> for<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.540> body

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
in an organic way positive for the body

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
in an organic way positive for the body
and<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:07.250> giving<00:03:08.000> power<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:08.750> also<00:03:08.830> looking

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
and not giving power but also looking

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
and not giving power but also looking
for<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.130> relaxation<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:10.940> between<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.650> spent

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
for the relaxation in between I spent

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.730 
for the relaxation in between I spent
hours<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.490> just<00:03:13.820> playing<00:03:14.360> tremolo<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.530> with<00:03:15.710> a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
hours of just playing tremolo and with a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.240 
hours of just playing tremolo and with a
metronome<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.490> 40<00:03:17.480> beats<00:03:17.840> per<00:03:18.170> minute<00:03:18.500> just

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
metronome at 40 beats per minute just

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.160 
metronome at 40 beats per minute just
looking<00:03:19.550> for<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.820> relaxation<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.750> between

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
looking for the relaxation in between

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.730 
looking for the relaxation in between
the<00:03:21.320> nose<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.000> get<00:03:23.480> in<00:03:23.630> feeling<00:03:24.080> for<00:03:24.320> when

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
the nose so you get in feeling for when

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.380 
the nose so you get in feeling for when
the<00:03:24.860> head<00:03:25.010> works<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.550> when<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.940> head<00:03:26.090> doesn't

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the head works and when the head doesn't

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.870 
the head works and when the head doesn't
work<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.990> you<00:03:27.050> know<00:03:27.680> all<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.250> guitarist<00:03:28.700> who

things I was in danger too but they

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.660 
things I was in danger too but they
disappeared<00:03:38.750> from<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.770> moment<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.220> started<00:03:40.550> to

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
disappeared from the moment I started to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.360 
disappeared from the moment I started to
change<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.090> technique<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.780> way<00:03:41.960> and<00:03:42.370> so

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
change the technique to that way and so

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.540 
change the technique to that way and so
I<00:03:43.550> feel<00:03:44.060> today<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:45.020> I'm<00:03:45.170> able<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.860> be<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> food

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
I feel today that I'm able to be a food

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.470 
I feel today that I'm able to be a food

to think when you play these things
which<00:03:56.540> are<00:03:56.810> called<00:03:57.560> mental<00:03:58.240> work<00:03:59.240> so<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.440> what
