work<00:02:06.990> every<00:02:07.230> time<00:02:07.399> if<00:02:08.399> they're<00:02:09.360> stupid<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
work every time if they're stupid and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
work every time if they're stupid and
they're<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.009> mark<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:12.180> white<00:02:12.420> now<00:02:12.569> if

I'm<00:02:12.780> gonna<00:02:12.900> try<00:02:13.080> market<00:02:13.560> it's<00:02:13.860> impossible

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
I'm gonna try market it's impossible

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860 
I'm gonna try market it's impossible
with<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> lag<00:02:14.849> happens<00:02:15.269> in<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.420> game<00:02:15.599> it's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
with the lag happens in this game it's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.780 
with the lag happens in this game it's
not<00:02:16.440> impossible<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.069> actually<00:02:17.250> do<00:02:17.580> good

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
not impossible to actually do good

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.330 
not impossible to actually do good
defense<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.440> happens<00:02:19.769> just<00:02:20.040> take<00:02:20.220> him

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
defense so if that happens just take him

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.440 
defense so if that happens just take him
off<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.459> dribble<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.030> always<00:02:21.209> tell<00:02:21.420> if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
off the dribble you can always tell if

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.729 
off the dribble you can always tell if
he's<00:02:21.629> doing<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.080> their<00:02:22.319> name<00:02:22.500> pops

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
he's doing that because their name pops

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.470 
he's doing that because their name pops
