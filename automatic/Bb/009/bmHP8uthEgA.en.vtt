both together you'll notice that the
headband<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> 905<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.420> better<00:01:01.260> designed

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
headband of the 905 I is better designed

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.260 
headband of the 905 I is better designed
in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> headband<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> 90<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.090> five

original<00:01:04.460> over<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> more

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
original over here we have it more

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.179 
original over here we have it more
curved<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> look<00:01:07.710> strange<00:01:08.010> about

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
curved which kind of look strange about

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.210 
curved which kind of look strange about
you<00:01:08.369> wearing<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> while<00:01:09.810> under<00:01:10.049> 905<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you wearing it while under 905 I this is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.770 
you wearing it while under 905 I this is
more<00:01:11.460> conventional<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> doesn't<00:01:12.720> look

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
more conventional so it doesn't look

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.920 
more conventional so it doesn't look
that<00:01:12.840> bad<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.380> compared<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> original

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
that bad at all compared to the original

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.929 
that bad at all compared to the original
so<00:01:15.930> yeah<00:01:16.080> hardware-wise<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.580> smaller

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
so yeah hardware-wise it's smaller

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.770 
so yeah hardware-wise it's smaller
lighter<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.430> i<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:21.060> say<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.390> design

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
lighter and i would say better design

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.520 
lighter and i would say better design
than<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> original<00:01:22.920> bhi<00:01:23.580> 205<00:01:24.140> so<00:01:25.140> apart<00:01:25.409> from

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
than the original bhi 205 so apart from

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
than the original bhi 205 so apart from
that<00:01:25.650> apart<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.700> basically<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
that apart from that it's basically the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.069 
that apart from that it's basically the
same<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.140> original<00:01:28.200> bh<00:01:28.740> 905<00:01:29.479> there<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.720> a

microphones<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.570> help<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.930> noise

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
microphones to help with noise

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.010 
microphones to help with noise
cancelling<00:01:49.590> which<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:51.020> limits

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
cancelling which is I think limits

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
cancelling which is I think limits
ninety-nine<00:01:52.500> percent<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> ambient<00:01:53.369> noise

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
ninety-nine percent of the ambient noise

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
ninety-nine percent of the ambient noise
so<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:55.320> cool<00:01:55.590> um<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> yeah<00:01:58.110> you

headphones I don't think anything in the
market<00:02:07.860> comes<00:02:08.069> close<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.610> original<00:02:08.700> bh

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
market comes close to the original bh

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.500 
market comes close to the original bh
905<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.739> were<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> good<00:02:11.190> and

905 because they were that good and
these<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.569> even<00:02:13.200> better

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
these are even better

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.670 
these are even better
as<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:15.240> might<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.960> look<00:02:16.200> much<00:02:16.530> better

as you might know they look much better

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.290 
as you might know they look much better
you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.070> go<00:02:17.280> out<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.580> public<00:02:17.730> wearing<00:02:18.120> these

the<00:02:21.150> 905<00:02:21.630> our<00:02:21.750> original<00:02:22.410> positive<00:02:22.830> so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the 905 our original positive so

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.210 
the 905 our original positive so
strangely<00:02:24.180> design<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.930> um<00:02:25.080> even<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> build

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
strangely design but um even the build

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
strangely design but um even the build
quality<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.790> seems<00:02:27.030> better<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:28.230> here

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
quality and this seems better right here

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.370 
quality and this seems better right here
you<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.340> this<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:30.000> point<00:02:30.240> right<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you see this this point right here this

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.700 
you see this this point right here this
is<00:02:31.440> where<00:02:31.770> my<00:02:31.830> original<00:02:32.520> blue<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:33.300> at<00:02:33.390> 905<00:02:34.020> kind

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
is where my original blue be at 905 kind

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070 
is where my original blue be at 905 kind
of<00:02:34.860> snapped<00:02:35.340> over<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.030> so<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> had<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:36.990> use

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
of snapped over here so I had to use

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.890 
of snapped over here so I had to use
some<00:02:37.230> subtle<00:02:37.710> tape<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.330> get<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.480> back<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
some subtle tape to get that back and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.560 
some subtle tape to get that back and
but<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.320> seems<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.950> much<00:02:41.130> more

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
but this seems like it's much more

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.080 
but this seems like it's much more
better<00:02:42.570> designed<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> bass<00:02:44.820> boost

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
better designed to get the bass boost

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.130 
better designed to get the bass boost
moving<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.280> connect<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.640> your

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
moving on you have to connect to your

moving on you have to connect to your
now<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.440> thing<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.040> bass<00:02:50.220> boost

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
now this is a thing to be the bass boost

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.450 
now this is a thing to be the bass boost

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
I and then tap the column key that you

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.550 
I and then tap the column key that you
can<00:03:08.760> see<00:03:08.880> right<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:09.210> tap<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.020> once<00:03:10.260> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
beeps it goes up to three beeps which is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.500 
beeps it goes up to three beeps which is
basically<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.630> level<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.050> bass<00:03:16.260> boost

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
you use the bass boost it should be much

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.330 
you use the bass boost it should be much
much<00:03:28.020> better<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.770> can<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
