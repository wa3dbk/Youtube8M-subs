00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 must my skin points face so 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 during the spring and summer I use 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 the fountains that are really light and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.070
 the bb cream of ounces had said that this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 is not enough covering I have to me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.719
 reassure that my phase 1 is no task 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.760
 but that's good and it's a beautiful 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.470
 shine and I'm going to show you to a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.500
 product that has been using for two months 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.659
 weeks that really changed my skin 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 my skin a beautiful bursts I do not have any more 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.140
 little black spots if my face and you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 know that I had the black ball 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 often you have big sites to face 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.400
 sloboda well where we are going 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 all to face who are really darker 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.450
 that the rest face and often as 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 local which it is a product that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 has been using for at least two weeks and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.689
 I have very good results in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.119
 products but because it uses and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.299
 the r hedge funds and skin range is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.829
 dense and a rex for black skin 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.140
 it is a range of products that is made 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.200
 for black women black skin 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.399
 so all our little problems that we 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.530
 had black skin that's a range 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.610
 which is especially for us 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.810
 I know that a star to face and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.299
 I also have the moisturizer 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.400
 I have the mask or I do not know how 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.520
 the scrub because we do not have 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.680
 that and then I repeat that I think 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.330
 my face it really changed my 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.100
 skin for two centuries and elissa 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.800
 I want them to be a bit of a month and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.020
 see how my poor reacted to that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.690
 then I will show you my product 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.870
 the most precious I have that you hear 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.180
 already talking about this is my mac media 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.700
 and as I told you this is a guy who 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 does for belly screens but that's 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 also very good for someone who has 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.080
 programmed my foundation I put everything 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.970
 just that and it reassures me that my phase 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.400
 is not going to be really oiled on 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.470
 imagine and maromme in the face will stay 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 really matt so for people who 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.160
 like oily skin that's it 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.370
 really a very, very, very good product 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.990
 people there I love them and well I'm going 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.780
 show you some foundation that 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.330
 use it during the spring summer 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.590
 so less during the summer the spring 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.620
 because it's so hot outside 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.390
 I studied a very happy product 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.920
 that they have really light so the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.230
 most of the time I put the cream bb 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.739
 so the 2 bb cream that I like 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.440
 it is that of Ms. Evelyn and that of 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.660
 iman so here are two showcases that I like 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.750
 good at one are not really covering up 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.730
 but I like them the next one in 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.010
 as long as I like it is the one of 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 Eve and it's the dream become 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.760
 the anthem and she really got 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.019
 tip is absorbed by palau 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.470
 am it is really very light to metz and 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.269
 covering a very not really covering 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.860
 do not really know it's really very good 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.620
 fountain and it's very easy to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.600
 to fade xac angers put my phase so 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.180
 I like this fantasy both 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.799
 next fountain that I like it is 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.760
 the real raw match of l'oreal paris and 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.019
 that's it and its color its 7 and n 8 and n 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 8 1-8 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.830
 so that's it during the summer and the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.269
 really spring during the spring 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.610
 I'm told it's 7 and while to help him 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.860
 I knew this n purpose 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.700
 so I like them they are light 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.590
 and 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.870
 and it does not weigh a lot so it's 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.510
 very good for my face during the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.690
 spring and summer I also like them 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.269
 doors the lost mac duoapps during 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.600
 summer not only six months but also 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.340
 my clients it gives a very beautiful shine 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.490
 to the skin when we put that 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.400
 so you take your childish I got 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.010
 your hand I felt there and I take 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.990
 a few drops that and five colors 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.060
 golden and I mix with my bottom of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.590
 dyed and I put surface and it gives me 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.060
 really a very nice a light yes because 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.010
 I can say it's really very 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.150
 beautiful then I'll show you the 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.729
 blushes that I like 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.330
 during the summer the spring has 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.070
 winter and autumn I like them 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.500
 bluffs in cash 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.030
 the blues are very loud and very dark 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.610
 but during the summer and spring 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.979
 I like powder blushes something 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.889
