size anyway so you on the brush tool so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.920 
size anyway so you on the brush tool so
you've<00:02:27.790> done<00:02:27.970> your<00:02:28.120> selection<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:28.780> like

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
a whole color you just do that and then

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.300 
a whole color you just do that and then
do<00:02:45.190> fill<00:02:45.580> path<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.840> there<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.680> go<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.190> you

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310

right click and then do strike and it

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.850 
right click and then do strike and it
just<00:02:55.840> puts<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.050> line<00:02:56.200> around<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.709> can

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
just puts a line around it you can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.980 
just puts a line around it you can
change<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:58.240> tool<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.660> you're<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> use

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
change the tool that you're going to use

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.020 
change the tool that you're going to use
maybe<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.800> want<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.190> use<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.490> blur<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.910> you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
maybe you want to use the blur so you

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.150 
maybe you want to use the blur so you
want<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> maybe<00:03:01.780> blurr<00:03:02.140> apart<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> face<00:03:02.860> you

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
want to maybe blurr apart the face you

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.590 
want to maybe blurr apart the face you
select<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.790> part<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.209> want<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.420> blur

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
and just does it it's a lot easier than

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.750 
and just does it it's a lot easier than
using<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.390> brush<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.900> blur<00:03:08.110> some<00:03:08.830> bits<00:03:09.130> is

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
using the brush to blur some bits is

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580 
using the brush to blur some bits is
easy<00:03:10.060> using<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.540> Pendle<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.050> it's<00:03:11.170> very<00:03:11.380> handy

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
easy using the Pendle so it's very handy

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.560 
easy using the Pendle so it's very handy
for<00:03:12.250> things<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:13.330> just<00:03:13.450> going

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
for things like that so I'm just going

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.680 
for things like that so I'm just going
to<00:03:13.630> use<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.900> brush<00:03:14.110> know<00:03:14.410> simulated<00:03:14.950> pressure

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
to use the brush know simulated pressure

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.690 
to use the brush know simulated pressure
and<00:03:16.690> then<00:03:16.870> click<00:03:17.200> OK<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.709> as<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:18.010> can<00:03:18.190> see<00:03:18.220> on

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
my original there it is so I'm going to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.509 
my original there it is so I'm going to
take<00:03:21.489> away<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:24.010> you've<00:03:24.160> got<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.370> line

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
take away so now you've got that line

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.949 
take away so now you've got that line
there<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.970> want<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.180> get<00:03:25.269> rid<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:25.810> all

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
you do is right click and then do delete

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.170 
you do is right click and then do delete
path<00:03:28.030> okay<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.290> there<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.590> go<00:03:29.620> you've<00:03:30.580> got

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
path okay and there you go you've got

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.170 
path okay and there you go you've got
your<00:03:31.390> basic<00:03:32.380> line<00:03:32.590> there<00:03:32.800> I'm<00:03:33.610> if<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.000> want

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
your basic line there I'm if you want

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.759 
your basic line there I'm if you want
that<00:03:34.209> line<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.600> be<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.750> different<00:03:35.230> color<00:03:35.470> when

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that line to be a different color when

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.280 
that line to be a different color when
you<00:03:35.860> stroke<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.430> change<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.720> color<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
you stroke it you change the color the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.550 
you stroke it you change the color the
foreground<00:03:39.220> color<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.239> go<00:03:40.560> that's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
foreground color so there you go that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.199 
foreground color so there you go that's
how<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.800> use<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.280> pen<00:03:42.489> tool<00:03:42.519> some<00:03:43.030> other

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
how you use the pen tool some other

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.840 
how you use the pen tool some other
shapes<00:03:43.959> might<00:03:44.230> be<00:03:44.350> harder<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.680> do<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.670> gym

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
shapes might be harder to do to the gym

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.509 
shapes might be harder to do to the gym
but<00:03:46.420> my<00:03:46.840> advice<00:03:47.410> would<00:03:47.799> be<00:03:47.860> taking<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> bit

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
but my advice would be taking a bit

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.180 
but my advice would be taking a bit
slower<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.989> like<00:03:50.110> even<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.560> circle<00:03:50.980> maybe

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
slower and for like even a circle maybe

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.070 
slower and for like even a circle maybe
do<00:03:51.430> quite<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:51.880> few<00:03:51.940> more<00:03:52.209> points<00:03:52.420> than<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.870> she

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
do quite a few more points than you she

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.479 
do quite a few more points than you she
