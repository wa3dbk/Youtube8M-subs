the broiler so make sure you keep an eye
on<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.880> if<00:03:25.030> your<00:03:25.150> broiler<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.750> particularly

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
on it if your broiler is particularly

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.620 
on it if your broiler is particularly
hot<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.190> then<00:03:27.880> we're<00:03:28.090> gonna<00:03:28.180> go<00:03:28.390> ahead<00:03:28.480> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
hot and then we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.330 
hot and then we're gonna go ahead and
show<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.200> next<00:03:29.500> steps<00:03:29.739> when<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.160> come

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
show you the next steps when we come

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.520

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
back

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.009 
back
so<00:03:32.530> our<00:03:32.650> maple<00:03:32.920> miso<00:03:33.310> tofu<00:03:33.730> has<00:03:34.150> come<00:03:34.420> out<00:03:34.630> half

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
so our maple miso tofu has come out half

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.810 
so our maple miso tofu has come out half
way<00:03:35.050> through<00:03:35.560> cooking<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.489> we've<00:03:36.640> been

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
way through cooking so we've been

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.580 
way through cooking so we've been
broiling<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:37.630> about<00:03:37.780> ten<00:03:38.080> minutes<00:03:38.290> and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
it's gotten nice and crispy so now it's

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.920 
it's gotten nice and crispy so now it's
time<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.650> flip<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.340> over<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.150> crisp<00:03:43.420> up<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
time to flip it over and to crisp up the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.620 
time to flip it over and to crisp up the
other<00:03:44.170> side<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:45.370> is<00:03:45.489> exactly<00:03:46.060> why<00:03:46.239> we<00:03:46.269> saved

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
other side that is exactly why we saved

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.390 
other side that is exactly why we saved
the<00:03:46.780> rest<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.140> our<00:03:47.260> marinade<00:03:47.680> because<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.160> want
