00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.460
 unpacking his game comes out 29 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 bill the day before sales in the game store 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 park for 2999 rubles, but what am I already 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.750
 actually playing this game she 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.810
 I really like it so I bought 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.480
 then the publication and I want to share in principle 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.899
 so that it is especially 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.290
 but here's the face we see so 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.320
 you just have a little figure like that 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.320
 open view this ps3 version if 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 you have not noticed suddenly the fact is crazy 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.610
 editions of 17 years on the right side of us 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.489
 mad recruiting is an addition which 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.199
 here is the principle of everything all yes plan 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 which generally can come out or which 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.390
 you can additionally buy 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.060
 they all go in this edition right away 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 we just have some information behind 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.140
 about the game 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is, you can go to the site here say 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 here is a little typo of ours 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.460
 what is written here 720p game goes but 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.920
 on the drive itself inside there and 1080p and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.820
 800 thousand that is the principle of such 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 little bug 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.200
 but I do not know maybe on all electronic 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 versions such and such a typo something that in 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360
 Basically, this is my first collectible 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.590
 the game that I bought from this side 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.180
 we are simply shown equipment and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.430
 the main character well what does it include 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 count edge 3 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 practical guide well you can 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.369
 in principle, read well, nothing 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.060
 such an interesting thing 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.060
 hide 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.900
 or fear principle the most interesting thing is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.930
 such is a very cool thing she 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.790
 performed in such 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:11.640
 rag-style box to postpone a 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.680
 here is such a material 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.660
 such here 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.750
 rough as if to say something not 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.650
 allowed here such a thing far cry 3 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:33.300
 well naturally well what are we now 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:36.410
 reveal here that we do not eat within 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.410
 we have a game here 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:46.560
 here actually this 1080 here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 written here as we see on the game 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.070
 written not for sale 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.010
 separately because it is visible 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.990
 deliver so much in insane editions and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.440
 that is, pass it somewhere or sell 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.910
 Someone can be a separate principle but 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.239
 will there be such there just on their 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.230
 box all that we have we have 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.720
 there is still such a garbage them the keys already 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.720
 led so not afraid to show it 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.170
 crazy set what we have here is just 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.260
 a small liner will show what 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.260
 she make you with her what this set 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.239
 gives opportunities but there is an opportunity 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.520
 in online or offline game 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.900
 picture and little documentation on 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.510
 different languages so it is the most interesting 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:45.180
 for you all three and the sector here is this 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:49.470
 This is such a guide let's say so 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.200
 survival it is made in such shabby 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.069
 let's say so that it is as if he 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.109
 You are very painful to the booth 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.430
 used here so here it is 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.749
 I'm not the most he did this 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.439
 when we open the page cakes 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:09.040
 let's all interesting in English 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:13.870
 language everything is so cool done to but 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.069
 everything is drawn everything is printed but here 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.349
 all sorts of interesting things 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.259
 reality even morse code 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:25.650
 The main teams that are here are 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.650
 There is basically very, very cool 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.080
 even there is in addition to the dog from the note 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:42.970
 for example how many trophies are he up to the dam 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:48.310
 Well, so what looks like us 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:54.400
 book now i'm gonna put you 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:57.190
 show the very figure of you and it lies in 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.789
 the box opens like this 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.009
 a figurine and gets a figurine she's going out 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.050
 style like Hawaiian little figures she 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.169
 here now we want bye but I already 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:20.169
 opened how many flowers will put it here 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:23.259
 so here it is, the figure does not hang out 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:28.659
 class it can be put so she x 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:30.810
 fell that is the leg is strange of course well then 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.909
 There is a principle of dangling normally 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.220
 made this this rubber it too 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.780
 some kind of hard rubber that's clean 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.199
 plastic 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.199
 maiden tea 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.680
 all this is my tribute to tea all this 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.200
 plastic but I will also say the details 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.580
 principle very good and wonderful 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:56.430
 even obskazal but before with a special and not 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.590
 you need some such complicated services 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.460
 things like there assassin's creed figures 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.230
 or something like that 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.720
 principle so pretty unpretentious 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.670
 figurine but I think someone is very suitable 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.020
 collection or somewhere so nice 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.890
 Well Well all of us Edition 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:24.990
 the figure is such a liner and 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:29.240
 actually all here and so all 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.240
 thanks for watching bye
