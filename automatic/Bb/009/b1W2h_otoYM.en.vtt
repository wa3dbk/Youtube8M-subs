00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
guys you don't play the game as much

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.130 
guys you don't play the game as much
anymore<00:01:37.950> they'll<00:01:38.670> leave<00:01:39.150> their<00:01:39.360> gold<00:01:39.869> mines

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
up and your gold mines will get a ton of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819 
up and your gold mines will get a ton of
loot<00:01:42.450> stored<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.680> just

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
loot stored up in them and you can just

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
loot stored up in them and you can just
take<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> fit<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> full<00:01:44.640> advantage<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.180> that

take it a fit a full advantage of that
so<00:01:45.600> we're<00:01:45.750> trying<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> find<00:01:46.170> those<00:01:46.350> bases<00:01:46.770> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so we're trying to find those bases that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 
so we're trying to find those bases that
have<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> lot<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> their<00:01:47.610> gold<00:01:47.850> mines<00:01:48.090> pretty

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
have a lot of their gold mines pretty

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
have a lot of their gold mines pretty
much<00:01:49.140> full<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.420> pretty<00:01:51.630> much<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
much full and that's pretty much the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
much full and that's pretty much the
optimal<00:01:52.380> range<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.740> tunnel<00:01:53.009> level<00:01:53.220> six<00:01:53.430> nine

hundred to about a thousand that's
probably<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> best<00:01:56.460> ranges<00:01:56.909> Town

to<00:03:03.109> be<00:03:03.200> talking<00:03:03.349> about<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.680> our<00:03:03.799> camp<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.129> level

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
to be talking about is our camp a level

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280 
to be talking about is our camp a level
8<00:03:04.519> that's<00:03:04.700> what<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.299> most<00:03:05.629> experienced<00:03:06.200> that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
8 that's what I'm most experienced that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.710 
8 that's what I'm most experienced that
I've<00:03:06.470> been<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.799> every<00:03:06.829> which<00:03:07.819> way<00:03:07.849> trophy<00:03:08.510> town

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
I've been to every which way trophy town

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.690 
I've been to every which way trophy town
and<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.859> definitely<00:03:10.099> prefer<00:03:10.459> about<00:03:11.200> 1152<00:03:12.200> about

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
and I definitely prefer about 1152 about

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.099 
and I definitely prefer about 1152 about
1350<00:03:13.700> those<00:03:13.879> are<00:03:14.030> my<00:03:14.150> favorite<00:03:14.540> ranges<00:03:14.930> right

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
1350 those are my favorite ranges right

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.099 
1350 those are my favorite ranges right
there<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:16.549> know<00:03:16.730> another<00:03:17.299> really<00:03:17.810> good

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
there and you know another really good

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.650 
there and you know another really good
range<00:03:18.379> it<00:03:19.370> really<00:03:19.730> competes<00:03:20.120> with<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.419> about

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
range it really competes with is about

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.309 
range it really competes with is about
1700<00:03:21.590> 1652<00:03:22.280> about<00:03:22.459> 1700<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.660> one<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.900> those<00:03:24.079> two

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
1700 1652 about 1700 so one of those two

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.259 
1700 1652 about 1700 so one of those two
ranges<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.889> can<00:03:25.010> go<00:03:25.190> ahead<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.519> figure<00:03:26.060> out

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
ranges you can go ahead and figure out

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.180 
ranges you can go ahead and figure out
it<00:03:27.199> really<00:03:27.230> doesn't<00:03:27.709> matter<00:03:27.799> they're<00:03:28.040> both

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
it really doesn't matter they're both

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.819 
it really doesn't matter they're both
pretty<00:03:28.489> good<00:03:29.199> we're<00:03:30.199> going<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.379> go<00:03:30.500> ahead<00:03:30.530> and

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
pretty good we're going to go ahead and

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.369 
pretty good we're going to go ahead and
go<00:03:31.160> on<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.489> town<00:03:31.699> hall<00:03:31.910> level<00:03:31.940> nine<00:03:32.449> and<00:03:32.780> that's

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
go on to town hall level nine and that's

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.159 
go on to town hall level nine and that's
definitely<00:03:33.859> going<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.340> be<00:03:34.519> around<00:03:35.150> 1350<00:03:35.959> to

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
definitely going to be around 1350 to

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.530 
definitely going to be around 1350 to
about<00:03:36.560> fifteen<00:03:37.160> hundred<00:03:37.190> fifteen<00:03:38.000> seventeen

line<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.449> are<00:03:47.569> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.900> find<00:03:48.049> those<00:03:48.230> raids

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
line you are going to find those raids

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.619 
line you are going to find those raids
of<00:03:48.739> those<00:03:48.919> ten<00:03:49.430> eleven<00:03:49.790> seven<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.209> it's<00:03:50.389> time<00:03:50.599> I

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
of those ten eleven seven so it's time I

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.819 
of those ten eleven seven so it's time I
level<00:03:51.019> eight<00:03:51.169> so<00:03:51.319> not<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> be<00:03:51.709> it's

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
level eight so not going to be it's

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.770 
level eight so not going to be it's
worth<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.250> as<00:03:52.370> they<00:03:52.519> once<00:03:52.699> were<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.660> to

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
worth it as they once were you have to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.629 
worth it as they once were you have to
do<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.049> more<00:03:54.109> hardcore<00:03:54.650> rating<00:03:55.099> so<00:03:55.549> i'd

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
do some more hardcore rating so i'd

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.220 
do some more hardcore rating so i'd
recommend<00:03:55.669> about<00:03:56.180> probably<00:03:56.629> about<00:03:56.810> anywhere

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
recommend about probably about anywhere

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930 
recommend about probably about anywhere
in<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.500> gold<00:03:57.769> three<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.159> go<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.609> range

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
in the gold three to go to range

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.780 
in the gold three to go to range
something<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.199> lines<00:04:00.409> of<00:04:00.620> about<00:04:00.949> let's

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
something on the lines of about let's

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.750 
something on the lines of about let's
say<00:04:01.879> about<00:04:02.120> 1452<00:04:02.989> about<00:04:03.379> 1750<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:04.340> uh<00:04:04.579> that's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
say about 1452 about 1750 and uh that's

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.089 
say about 1452 about 1750 and uh that's
a<00:04:04.849> real<00:04:05.150> big<00:04:05.359> gap<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.349> that's<00:04:06.680> probably<00:04:06.919> the

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
a real big gap but that's probably the

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.009 
a real big gap but that's probably the
best<00:04:07.370> range<00:04:07.790> right<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.269> actually<00:04:08.629> have

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
best range right there I actually have

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.899 
best range right there I actually have
seen<00:04:09.319> a<00:04:09.590> few<00:04:09.799> tunnel<00:04:10.250> knives<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.639> that's<00:04:10.760> what

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
seen a few tunnel knives and that's what

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.000 
seen a few tunnel knives and that's what
they<00:04:11.060> recommend<00:04:11.540> gold<00:04:12.169> one<00:04:12.409> you<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.709> go<00:04:12.859> all

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
they recommend gold one you can go all

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.469 
they recommend gold one you can go all
the<00:04:13.099> way<00:04:13.159> up<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.579> I've<00:04:13.790> seen<00:04:14.090> one<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.359> them

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
the way up to that I've seen one of them

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.330 
the way up to that I've seen one of them
he's<00:04:15.290> been<00:04:15.530> all<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.709> way<00:04:15.799> up<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:15.919> nineteen

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
he's been all the way up to nineteen

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.670 
he's been all the way up to nineteen
fifty<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.880> he<00:04:16.970> said<00:04:17.209> extremely<00:04:17.870> well<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.380> don't

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
fifty and he said extremely well I don't

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.469 
fifty and he said extremely well I don't
say<00:04:18.949> don't<00:04:19.280> really<00:04:19.549> go<00:04:19.699> into<00:04:19.820> crystal<00:04:20.359> it's

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
say don't really go into crystal it's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:21.960 
say don't really go into crystal it's
really<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:20.870> worth<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.289> I

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
really not worth it I

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.520 
really not worth it I
definitely<00:04:22.270> recommend<00:04:22.660> sticking<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.200> around

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
definitely recommend sticking to around

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.590 
definitely recommend sticking to around
1450<00:04:24.280> all<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.640> way<00:04:24.730> up<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.850> nineteen<00:04:25.270> fifty

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
1450 all the way up to nineteen fifty

1450 all the way up to nineteen fifty
optimal<00:04:26.410> range<00:04:26.560> would<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.800> about<00:04:26.980> 1650<00:04:27.670> to

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
about 1850 those are the real optimal

about 1850 those are the real optimal
ranges<00:04:30.310> we're<00:04:30.790> going<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.000> find<00:04:31.150> some<00:04:31.210> really

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
ranges we're going to find some really

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.630 
ranges we're going to find some really
good<00:04:31.630> loop<00:04:31.840> but<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:33.100> know<00:04:33.220> if<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.400> want<00:04:33.550> to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
good loop but you know if you want to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.040 
good loop but you know if you want to
venture<00:04:33.790> off<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.060> go<00:04:34.360> into<00:04:34.480> those<00:04:34.630> lowers

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
venture off and go into those lowers

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.720 
venture off and go into those lowers
those<00:04:35.200> higher<00:04:35.440> brackets<00:04:35.980> they<00:04:36.340> might<00:04:36.550> offer
