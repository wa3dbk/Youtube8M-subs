00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
layer but it's completely optional if

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.349 
layer but it's completely optional if
you<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.590> them<00:02:47.859> these<00:02:48.280> are<00:02:48.459> pickled<00:02:48.849> capers

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
flavor mm-hmm and it gives a little

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.880 
flavor mm-hmm and it gives a little
