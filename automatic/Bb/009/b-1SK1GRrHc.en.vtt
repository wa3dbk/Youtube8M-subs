I got the zilla's on now and my IQ

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.590 
I got the zilla's on now and my IQ
deltas<00:00:14.660> these<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:17.369> max<00:00:17.609> SL<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.480> don't

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
deltas these are the max SL is I don't

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.359 
deltas these are the max SL is I don't
know<00:00:18.690> just<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.080> everyone<00:00:19.680> has<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:19.949> seen<00:00:20.189> my

zoella's before 28:12 by 12s all the way

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.460 
zoella's before 28:12 by 12s all the way
around<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:25.160> night<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.340> Delta's<00:00:27.109> black<00:00:28.109> cat

around a night to be Delta's black cat
black<00:00:28.800> slugs<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:31.189> as<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:32.850> even<00:00:33.390> with

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
black slugs and as you can see even with

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.430 
black slugs and as you can see even with
being<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> Rhino<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.340> sold<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.410> 20

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
being on the Rhino and I sold it with 20

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.160 
being on the Rhino and I sold it with 20
I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.100> 2500<00:00:38.940> miles<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.809> somewhat

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I think 2500 miles on it and somewhat

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.290 
I think 2500 miles on it and somewhat
brute<00:00:40.350> force<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.770> 5<00:00:41.129> something<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
brute force with 5 something on it and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.279 
brute force with 5 something on it and
these<00:00:43.020> tires<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:44.129> still<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.960> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
these tires are still really good so I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.660 
these tires are still really good so I
don't<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> hear<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.340> people

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
don't want to hear it from people

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
don't want to hear it from people
talking<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.090> how<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.510> wear<00:00:48.780> fast<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.710> as

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
talking about how they wear fast and as

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.389 
talking about how they wear fast and as
you<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.969> DMV<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.739> videos<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.190> ride

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you see with DMV and as videos we ride

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.549 
you see with DMV and as videos we ride
in<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> road<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> quite<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.840> even<00:00:55.440> though

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in the road a quite a bit so even though

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.639 
in the road a quite a bit so even though
three<00:00:55.890> years<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.760> mean<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.289> bad<00:00:58.620> at

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
three years here I mean they are bad at

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.740 
three years here I mean they are bad at
all<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.160> swap<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.699> around<00:00:59.760> I'll<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.660> know

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
all I do swap them around I'll you know

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.529 
all I do swap them around I'll you know
because<00:01:01.079> they<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.579> same<00:01:02.789> rims<00:01:03.180> same

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
because they are the same rims same

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.410 
because they are the same rims same
tires<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.290> anyway<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:05.610> tires<00:01:05.909> would<00:01:06.150> last

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
tires but anyway these tires would last

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
tires but anyway these tires would last
a<00:01:06.630> while<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.080> listen<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> people<00:01:07.619> they're<00:01:08.400> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
a while don't listen to people they're a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.920 
a while don't listen to people they're a
lot<00:01:08.549> better<00:01:08.760> than<00:01:08.970> mud<00:01:09.150> lights<00:01:09.420> they're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
lot better than mud lights they're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
lot better than mud lights they're
strong<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.210> like<00:01:12.360> them

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
strong you know so I really like them

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
strong you know so I really like them
but<00:01:12.960> anyway<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> much<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> video

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
but anyway this is much like a video

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.330 
but anyway this is much like a video
here<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.650> tires<00:01:16.890> rims<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
here now I got my the tires rims on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:32.210 
here now I got my the tires rims on
there<00:01:17.610> my<00:01:18.540> 2012<00:01:19.140> perforce<00:01:31.070> definitely<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> lot

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
there my 2012 perforce definitely a lot

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.920 
there my 2012 perforce definitely a lot
bigger<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.909> before

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.940 

back<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:38.960> I'll<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.439> measurements

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
back up here I'll do some measurements

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260 
back up here I'll do some measurements
here<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> second<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.880> gonna<00:01:42.090> give<00:01:42.180> you

here in a second I'm just gonna give you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.929 
here in a second I'm just gonna give you
a<00:01:42.299> walk<00:01:42.840> around

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.480 

and<00:01:47.479> they're<00:01:47.659> all<00:01:47.810> set<00:01:48.049> at<00:01:48.200> 10<00:01:48.439> psi<00:01:48.770> right<00:01:49.280> now

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
and they're all set at 10 psi right now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.039 
and they're all set at 10 psi right now
I<00:01:49.520> might<00:01:49.850> drop<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.240> down<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:50.750> that's<00:01:50.810> what<00:01:50.990> I

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
I might drop it down but that's what I

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.170 
I might drop it down but that's what I
had<00:01:51.259> on<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.860> Rhino<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:52.640> didn't<00:01:52.880> even<00:01:53.000> mess

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
had on the Rhino so I didn't even mess

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.499 
had on the Rhino so I didn't even mess
with<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:55.579> they<00:01:55.729> are<00:01:55.759> never<00:01:56.119> any<00:01:56.299> bead

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
with it and they are never any bead

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.450 
with it and they are never any bead
problems<00:01:56.930> with<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.140> psi<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.039> might<00:01:58.310> just

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
problems with that psi so I might just

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.029 
problems with that psi so I might just
leave<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.789> will<00:01:58.939> say<00:01:59.259> all<00:02:00.259> right<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.439> from<00:02:00.799> some

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
leave it will say all right so from some

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.969 
leave it will say all right so from some
measurements<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.020> with<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> zilla's<00:02:03.530> and

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
measurements now with the zilla's and

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.469 
measurements now with the zilla's and
like<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.399> said<00:02:04.460> before<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.850> haven't<00:02:05.090> changed

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
like I said before I haven't changed

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.210 
like I said before I haven't changed
settings<00:02:05.990> around<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.560> second<00:02:07.009> from<00:02:07.189> the

than<00:02:30.709> 14<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> half<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.519> after

than 14 and a half and this is after

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.199 
than 14 and a half and this is after
riding<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.870> it's<00:02:36.230> not<00:02:36.410> off<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> jack<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.060> it

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
riding it so it's not off the jack so it

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.910 
riding it so it's not off the jack so it
has<00:02:38.329> sagged<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:39.220> wrote<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.310> before<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:42.230> right

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
has sagged I wrote it before and right

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.600 
has sagged I wrote it before and right
there<00:02:44.110> or<00:02:45.110> exactly<00:02:45.650> at<00:02:45.769> 12<00:02:45.920> as<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.489> see

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
there or exactly at 12 as you can see

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.850 
there or exactly at 12 as you can see
right<00:02:46.790> from<00:02:46.970> there<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.269> there<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:48.500> bottom<00:02:48.799> is

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
right from there to there the bottom is

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.759 
right from there to there the bottom is
skid<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:50.269> was<00:02:50.360> only<00:02:50.569> 9<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:50.810> think<00:02:51.319> in<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> first

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
skid it was only 9 I think in the first

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.860 
skid it was only 9 I think in the first
bit<00:02:52.010> if<00:02:52.190> I'm<00:02:52.370> correct<00:02:52.730> or<00:02:53.120> something<00:02:53.540> now

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
bit if I'm correct or something now

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.370 
bit if I'm correct or something now
maybe<00:02:54.260> 10<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.810> gets<00:02:56.959> me<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.170> ground

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
maybe 10 so it gets me the ground

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.789 
maybe 10 so it gets me the ground
clearance<00:02:57.590> now<00:02:57.859> another<00:02:58.310> side<00:02:58.609> 14<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:02.799> it's

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
clearance now another side 14 so it's

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:04.960 
clearance now another side 14 so it's
pretty<00:03:04.010> good<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.340> know<00:03:04.459> I'm<00:03:04.519> happy<00:03:04.730> with<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
pretty good you know I'm happy with it

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.699 
pretty good you know I'm happy with it
I'm<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.329> gonna<00:03:05.450> lift<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.900> all<00:03:06.139> I<00:03:06.170> don't<00:03:06.319> want

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
I'm not gonna lift it all I don't want

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.920 
I'm not gonna lift it all I don't want
to<00:03:06.769> mess<00:03:06.859> with<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.069> axles<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.940> don't<00:03:08.660> deal<00:03:08.810> with

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
to mess with the axles I don't deal with

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.809 
to mess with the axles I don't deal with
that<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:10.819> know<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:10.970> exhaust<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:12.170> talked<00:03:13.130> the

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
that you know the exhaust I talked the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.720 
that you know the exhaust I talked the
guys<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.299> line<00:03:14.569> there<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.079> ATV<00:03:16.010> galaxy<00:03:16.579> and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
guys on line there and ATV galaxy and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.870 
guys on line there and ATV galaxy and
they're<00:03:16.819> on<00:03:16.910> backorder<00:03:17.500> supposedly<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:19.519> it's

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
they're on backorder supposedly so it's

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.920 
they're on backorder supposedly so it's
good<00:03:20.000> for<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.209> 2012<00:03:20.750> HMS<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.769> Black<00:03:22.690> Mesa<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
good for the 2012 HMS in Black Mesa to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.520 
good for the 2012 HMS in Black Mesa to
secure<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> gas<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.200> side<00:03:27.500> I

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
secure it with the gas and that side I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.840 
secure it with the gas and that side I
guess<00:03:27.739> this<00:03:27.859> is<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> little<00:03:28.220> lower<00:03:28.340> over<00:03:28.639> there

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
guess this is a little lower over there

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.770 
guess this is a little lower over there
gas<00:03:29.329> tank<00:03:30.250> anyway<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.819> there's<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.720> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
gas tank anyway so there's that and you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.050 
gas tank anyway so there's that and you
know<00:03:32.870> for<00:03:33.319> about<00:03:33.530> 10<00:03:33.769> days<00:03:33.920> or<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.579> H<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:34.970> F

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
know for about 10 days or so that H of F

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.490 
know for about 10 days or so that H of F
will<00:03:35.180> be<00:03:35.269> on<00:03:35.359> backorder<00:03:35.780> won't<00:03:36.049> have<00:03:36.200> that<00:03:36.230> for

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
will be on backorder won't have that for

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.610 
will be on backorder won't have that for
a<00:03:36.560> while<00:03:36.739> but<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.579> then<00:03:38.410> I'm<00:03:39.410> getting

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
a while but that and then I'm getting

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.199 
a while but that and then I'm getting
that<00:03:39.889> uni<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.790> possibly<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.810> optimizer

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
that uni and possibly this the optimizer

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.920 
that uni and possibly this the optimizer
right<00:03:44.209> now<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.549> there<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.239> right<00:03:47.690> now

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
right now so there it is right now

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.930 
right now so there it is right now
that's<00:03:48.200> where<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.130> going<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.310> sit<00:03:49.609> until<00:03:49.790> I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
that's where it's going to sit until I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.460 
that's where it's going to sit until I
get<00:03:50.090> exhaust<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.720> then<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.109> next<00:03:51.349> thing

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
get exhaust and then the next thing

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.610 
get exhaust and then the next thing
after<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.739> would<00:03:52.040> probably<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:53.019> my<00:03:54.019> clutch

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
after that would probably be my clutch

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.560 
after that would probably be my clutch
kit<00:03:54.859> probably<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.370> maroon<00:03:55.609> primary<00:03:56.150> almond

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
kit probably the maroon primary almond

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.530 
kit probably the maroon primary almond
secondary<00:03:57.139> just<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> other<00:03:57.799> one

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
secondary just like the other one

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.309 
secondary just like the other one
so<00:03:59.810> I<00:04:00.819> also<00:04:01.819> one<00:04:02.120> thing<00:04:02.269> else<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.510> did<00:04:02.659> today<00:04:02.810> or

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
so I also one thing else I did today or

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.330 
so I also one thing else I did today or
last<00:04:04.189> night<00:04:04.489> as<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.849> me<00:04:05.030> too
