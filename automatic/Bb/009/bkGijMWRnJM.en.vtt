off<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.320> boat<00:00:44.649> and<00:00:44.890> so<00:00:45.789> I<00:00:45.820> did<00:00:46.059> not<00:00:46.239> have<00:00:46.420> my

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
off the boat and so I did not have my

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.050 
off the boat and so I did not have my
kayak

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
kayak

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.069 
kayak
so<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.720> had<00:00:48.990> to<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.560> a<00:00:49.590> regular<00:00:49.890> lifeguard

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.990 

my<00:00:56.379> fish<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.039> float<00:00:57.309> or<00:00:57.579> use<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.879> queen

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
my fish to that float or use a queen

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500 
my fish to that float or use a queen
process

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
process

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.509

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
and so that's what I did

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.140 
and so that's what I did
as<00:01:04.609> I<00:01:04.789> was<00:01:04.939> diving<00:01:05.119> ahead

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
as I was diving ahead

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.980 
as I was diving ahead
six<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.050> seven<00:01:07.110> fish<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.800> there<00:01:07.920> including

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.480 
six or seven fish on there including

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
luckily when I was diving around the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.380 
luckily when I was diving around the
boat<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.439> told<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.280> little<00:01:16.549> bit<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:16.850> current<00:01:17.180> of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
people will see tiger sharks all times

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.200 
people will see tiger sharks all times
big<00:02:29.300> deal<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.540> them

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
big deal to them

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.000 
big deal to them
as<00:02:31.330> my<00:02:31.870> first<00:02:32.110> time<00:02:32.230> I've<00:02:32.380> actually<00:02:32.530> seen<00:02:32.950> one

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
as my first time I've actually seen one

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.270 
as my first time I've actually seen one
in<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> water<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:35.290> encounter<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:36.100> these

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
in the water and to encounter in these

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.940 
in the water and to encounter in these
fashions<00:02:36.790> rather

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
fashions rather

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.740 
fashions rather
surprising<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.129> for<00:02:39.879> some<00:02:40.030> reason<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.420> kept<00:02:40.629> my

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
surprising but for some reason I kept my

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.009 
surprising but for some reason I kept my
cool<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.459> as<00:02:42.879> his<00:02:43.030> point<00:02:43.360> 8<00:02:43.599> eventually

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
cool and so as his point 8 eventually

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.630 
cool and so as his point 8 eventually
gave<00:02:44.260> way<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.890> thought<00:02:45.069> okay<00:02:45.340> maybe<00:02:45.370> he

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
gave way and I thought okay maybe he

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.630 
gave way and I thought okay maybe he
ripped<00:02:45.970> off<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.390> broke<00:02:46.629> off<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.959> flow<00:02:47.260> or

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
ripped off for broke off in the flow or

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.680 
ripped off for broke off in the flow or
something<00:02:48.640> like<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.239> pulled<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.569> my

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
something like that so I pulled in my

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.509 
something like that so I pulled in my
line<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:49.900> surprisingly<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.890> phone<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.340> still

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
line and surprisingly my phone is still

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.850 
line and surprisingly my phone is still
attached<00:02:51.849> and<00:02:52.120> half<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.110> my<00:02:53.260> fish<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.500> still

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
attached and half of my fish was still

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.320 
attached and half of my fish was still
on<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.400> he<00:02:54.610> didn't<00:02:54.849> break<00:02:54.970> off<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
on there so he didn't break off the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.979 
on there so he didn't break off the
Queen

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.290 

but<00:02:59.989> as<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.830> happened<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.550> noticed<00:03:02.060> he<00:03:02.180> was

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
but as that happened I noticed he was

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.780 
but as that happened I noticed he was
coming<00:03:02.599> right<00:03:02.629> back<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:03.769> food<00:03:04.370> was<00:03:04.550> about

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
coming right back and so food was about

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850 
coming right back and so food was about
maybe<00:03:04.940> 10<00:03:05.209> 15<00:03:05.360> feet<00:03:05.599> away<00:03:05.840> from<00:03:05.989> me<00:03:06.260> he's

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
maybe 10 15 feet away from me he's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.070 
maybe 10 15 feet away from me he's
coming<00:03:07.160> back<00:03:07.340> I'm<00:03:07.670> like<00:03:07.910> oh

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
coming back I'm like oh

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.200 
coming back I'm like oh
go<00:03:09.230> through<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.530> again<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.370> don't<00:03:11.090> want

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
go through that again and I don't want

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.470 
go through that again and I don't want
to<00:03:11.300> lose<00:03:11.420> my<00:03:11.450> flow<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:13.400> guess<00:03:13.670> right<00:03:14.270> one

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to lose my flow so I guess right one

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480 
to lose my flow so I guess right one
who's<00:03:14.660> about<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.930> bite<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.500> again<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.830> decided

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
who's about to bite it again I decided

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.700 
who's about to bite it again I decided
not<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.210> let<00:03:17.360> him<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.350> pulled<00:03:18.620> it

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
not to let him do that so I pulled it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.120 
not to let him do that so I pulled it
away<00:03:18.830> from<00:03:19.160> him<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.520> he<00:03:19.670> missed<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:21.170> then<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
away from him and he missed but then the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.860 
away from him and he missed but then the
float<00:03:22.370> was<00:03:22.610> only<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.090> five<00:03:23.420> feet<00:03:23.600> away<00:03:23.720> from

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
float was only like five feet away from

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.470 
float was only like five feet away from
me<00:03:24.050> and<00:03:24.410> then<00:03:25.280> here<00:03:25.610> comes<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.970> sharp<00:03:26.180> again

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
me and then here comes to sharp again

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.260 
me and then here comes to sharp again
and<00:03:26.720> it's<00:03:26.810> gonna<00:03:26.960> try<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.000> was

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
and it's gonna try that again so I was

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.200 
and it's gonna try that again so I was
like<00:03:29.450> okay<00:03:29.740> let's<00:03:30.740> see<00:03:30.950> what<00:03:30.980> happens<00:03:31.460> and<00:03:31.730> he

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
like okay let's see what happens and he

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.480 
like okay let's see what happens and he
came<00:03:32.480> up<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.440> float<00:03:33.680> again<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
came up to the float again and the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.800 
came up to the float again and the
floats<00:03:34.760> pretty<00:03:35.090> much<00:03:35.240> were<00:03:35.360> in<00:03:35.450> front<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.690> me

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
floats pretty much were in front of me

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.090 
floats pretty much were in front of me
and<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.110> try<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.290> bite<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.680> pulled<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.010> away
