rats<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.680> would<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.520> them<00:02:23.700> behave

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
rats that would then make them behave

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.270 
rats that would then make them behave
more<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.840> opposite<00:02:25.290> sex<00:02:25.530> during<00:02:25.950> mating

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
more like the opposite sex during mating

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.010 
more like the opposite sex during mating
which<00:02:26.790> basically<00:02:27.209> means<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.810> female

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
which basically means that the female

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.610 
which basically means that the female
arches<00:02:28.590> her<00:02:28.739> back<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.610> sticks<00:02:29.940> her<00:02:30.060> butt<00:02:30.239> up

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
arches her back and sticks her butt up

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250 
arches her back and sticks her butt up
and<00:02:31.620> so<00:02:32.520> if<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.760> castrate<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.270> mail<00:02:33.450> before

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and so if you castrate the mail before

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.690 
and so if you castrate the mail before
they're<00:02:34.590> fully<00:02:34.770> developed<00:02:35.190> since<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> mouse

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
they're fully developed since the mouse

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.760 
they're fully developed since the mouse
is<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> mouse<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.750> born<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.350> not<00:02:37.500> fully

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
is when the mouse is born it's not fully

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.400 
is when the mouse is born it's not fully
developed<00:02:37.800> yet<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.660> if<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.870> castrate<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
developed yet so if you castrate the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.960 
developed yet so if you castrate the
mail<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:40.890> born<00:02:41.100> for<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.760> fully

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
mail when it's born for it fully

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.920 
mail when it's born for it fully
develops<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.750> actually<00:02:42.930> apparently

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
develops you can actually apparently

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.600 
develops you can actually apparently
create<00:02:45.930> or<00:02:46.590> cause<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.980> male<00:02:47.160> than<00:02:47.400> during

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
create or cause that male than during

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.570 
create or cause that male than during
mating<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.870> behave<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> female<00:02:50.280> because

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
mating to behave like a female because

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.820 
mating to behave like a female because
rats<00:02:50.910> don't<00:02:51.180> discriminate<00:02:52.019> with<00:02:52.560> mating

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
rats don't discriminate with mating

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.800 
rats don't discriminate with mating
activities<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.610> they'll<00:02:53.760> try<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> breathe

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
activities and they'll try and breathe

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.060 
activities and they'll try and breathe
with<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.080> male<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.310> general<00:02:57.019> but<00:02:58.019> but<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
with a male just in general but but the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.800 
with a male just in general but but the
male<00:02:59.220> acts<00:02:59.459> differently<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.180> then<00:03:00.510> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
male acts differently so that then that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.920 
male acts differently so that then that
coupling<00:03:01.739> doesn't<00:03:02.070> take<00:03:02.220> place<00:03:02.459> so<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.780> thought

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
coupling doesn't take place so I thought

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.170 
coupling doesn't take place so I thought
that<00:03:04.080> was<00:03:04.170> kind<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.380> interesting<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:06.030> it's

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that was kind of interesting but it's

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.330 
that was kind of interesting but it's
not<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.510> scientific<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:08.010> me<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.130> thought

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
not really scientific to me I thought

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.330 
not really scientific to me I thought
it's<00:03:08.700> behaviorally<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.660> face<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.380> that's<00:03:11.220> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it's behaviorally to face and that's a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
it's behaviorally to face and that's a
different<00:03:11.700> aspect<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> signs<00:03:12.329> that's<00:03:12.570> not<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
different aspect of signs that's not to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
different aspect of signs that's not to
me<00:03:13.350> that's<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.799> psychological<00:03:14.730> baseline<00:03:15.060> it's

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
me that's a psychological baseline it's

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.080 
me that's a psychological baseline it's
not<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> hard<00:03:15.720> science<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
not a hard science and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.900 
not a hard science and
they're<00:03:18.750> not<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.080> looking<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.560> what

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
they're not really looking at what

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
they're not really looking at what
what's<00:03:20.910> different<00:03:21.150> chemically<00:03:21.930> between

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
what's different chemically between

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.150 
what's different chemically between
those<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.459> mice<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.800> know<00:03:25.830> so

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
those the mice and it's just you know so

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.320 
those the mice and it's just you know so
I<00:03:26.190> think<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:27.000> can't<00:03:27.870> call<00:03:28.110> them<00:03:28.230> gay<00:03:28.410> rats<00:03:28.680> I

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
I think you can't call them gay rats I

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.530 
I think you can't call them gay rats I
think<00:03:30.330> that's<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:31.110> definitely<00:03:31.739> misnomer

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
think that's it it definitely misnomer

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.390 
think that's it it definitely misnomer
and<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:34.140> my<00:03:34.410> thought<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
and that's my thought on that one the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.339 
and that's my thought on that one the
other<00:03:35.549> thing<00:03:35.790> was<00:03:36.060> where<00:03:36.420> they<00:03:36.780> had<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> study

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
other thing was where they had a study

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.020 
other thing was where they had a study
of<00:03:37.410> twins<00:03:37.739> where<00:03:38.069> one<00:03:38.220> twin<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.489> gay<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.819> one

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
of twins where one twin is gay and one

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030 
of twins where one twin is gay and one
point<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.330> not<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.780> they're<00:03:39.900> sort<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.319> saying

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
point is not and they're sort of saying

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.039 
point is not and they're sort of saying
well<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.370> sort<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.640> refutes<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> whole<00:03:42.480> it's

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
well this sort of refutes the whole it's

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.559 
well this sort of refutes the whole it's
a<00:03:43.170> genetic<00:03:43.470> day<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:45.030> don't<00:03:45.390> think<00:03:45.510> that's

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
a genetic day and I don't think that's

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.360 
a genetic day and I don't think that's
very<00:03:45.690> true<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.470> there<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.739> identical<00:03:47.160> twin

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
very true and there are identical twin

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.559 
very true and there are identical twin
so<00:03:47.640> they<00:03:48.030> share<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.660> same<00:03:48.870> DNA<00:03:49.049> but<00:03:50.569> if

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
so they share all the same DNA but if

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.240 
so they share all the same DNA but if
anything<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.110> think<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.410> goes<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.739> show<00:03:52.769> how

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
anything I think it goes to show how

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.430 
anything I think it goes to show how
it's<00:03:53.489> not<00:03:53.730> solely<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.690> genetic<00:03:55.110> thing<00:03:55.140> like

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
it's not solely a genetic thing like

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.650 
it's not solely a genetic thing like
most<00:03:55.680> things<00:03:55.950> aren't<00:03:56.870> solely<00:03:57.870> genetic<00:03:59.660> there

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
most things aren't solely genetic there

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.089 
most things aren't solely genetic there
would<00:04:00.780> be<00:04:00.810> what<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.230> would<00:04:01.440> call<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:03.739> gene<00:04:04.739> that

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
would be what you would call a gene that

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.750 
would be what you would call a gene that
would<00:04:05.780> sort<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.900> pre<00:04:07.110> Dustin<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.400> gay

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
would sort of pre Dustin you to be gay

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000 
would sort of pre Dustin you to be gay
but<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.540> still<00:04:09.930> look<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.410> depend<00:04:10.920> on

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
but it still look at can depend on

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.800 
but it still look at can depend on
environment<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.700> your<00:04:11.940> social<00:04:12.180> interaction

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
environment and your social interaction

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.690 
environment and your social interaction
it's<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.799> same<00:04:13.980> way<00:04:14.160> with<00:04:14.340> different

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
it's the same way with different

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.310 
it's the same way with different
diseases<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.239> things<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.540> may<00:04:15.660> have<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.199> may

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
diseases and things you may have you may

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.170 
diseases and things you may have you may
be<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.470> carrier<00:04:16.919> for<00:04:17.010> for<00:04:17.699> something<00:04:18.000> or<00:04:18.120> you

be a carrier for for something or you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.349 
be a carrier for for something or you
may<00:04:18.269> have<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.449> gene<00:04:18.989> which<00:04:19.229> for<00:04:19.949> instance

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
may have a gene which for instance

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.340 
may have a gene which for instance
causes<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.539> be<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> higher<00:04:21.900> risk<00:04:22.139> for

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
causes you to be a higher risk for

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.779 
causes you to be a higher risk for
Alzheimer's<00:04:22.800> disease<00:04:23.100> or<00:04:23.430> something<00:04:23.639> like

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
Alzheimer's disease or something like

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.270 
Alzheimer's disease or something like
that<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:24.600> won't<00:04:24.840> be<00:04:24.990> triggered<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.950> disease

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
that but won't be triggered the disease

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.460 
that but won't be triggered the disease
will<00:04:26.400> be<00:04:26.550> triggered<00:04:26.789> unless<00:04:27.240> you're<00:04:27.900> exposed

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
will be triggered unless you're exposed

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.540 
will be triggered unless you're exposed
to<00:04:28.620> certain<00:04:28.770> things<00:04:29.130> within<00:04:29.340> your

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
to certain things within your

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.890 
to certain things within your
environment<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.300> think<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:30.600> probably

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
environment and I think it's probably

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.200 
environment and I think it's probably
the<00:04:31.050> same<00:04:31.229> way<00:04:31.490> and<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:32.880> thought<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.030> was

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
the same way and I just thought that was

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.640 
the same way and I just thought that was
witnessed<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.720> its<00:04:33.870> really<00:04:33.990> think<00:04:34.590> about

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
witnessed and its really think about

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.250 
witnessed and its really think about
whether<00:04:34.979> all<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.880> evidence<00:04:36.330> is<00:04:36.539> there<00:04:36.570> for<00:04:36.930> it

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
whether all the evidence is there for it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.570 
whether all the evidence is there for it
being<00:04:37.470> genetic<00:04:37.860> or<00:04:37.979> not<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.860> me<00:04:41.010> studies

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
being genetic or not and to me studies

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.480 
being genetic or not and to me studies
like<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.270> their<00:04:43.260> intended<00:04:43.590> most<00:04:43.919> mostly

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
like that I their intended most mostly

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.219 
like that I their intended most mostly
intended<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.150> sort<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.630> prove<00:04:45.840> yes<00:04:46.080> its

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
intended to sort of prove yes its

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.089 
intended to sort of prove yes its
genetic<00:04:46.590> thing<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:48.500> it's<00:04:49.500> not<00:04:49.680> something<00:04:49.800> we

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
genetic thing and it's not something we

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:52.420 
genetic thing and it's not something we
have<00:04:50.250> control<00:04:50.669> over<00:04:50.700> it's<00:04:51.030> not<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.180> choice<00:04:51.450> and

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
have control over it's not a choice and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.909 
have control over it's not a choice and
sort<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.550> use<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:55.139> push<00:04:55.349> for<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> idea

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
sort of use that to push for the idea

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.379 
sort of use that to push for the idea
that<00:04:55.950> we're<00:04:56.160> just<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.760> same<00:04:56.970> as<00:04:57.120> everyone

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
that we're just the same as everyone

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.300 
that we're just the same as everyone
else<00:04:57.599> where<00:04:58.020> people<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.950> deserve<00:04:59.220> all

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
else where people and you deserve all

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.790 
else where people and you deserve all
right<00:04:59.760> at<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.570> same<00:05:00.720> time<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:01.080> also<00:05:01.110> gives<00:05:01.560> a

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
right at the same time it also gives a

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.520 
right at the same time it also gives a
lot<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.220> fuel<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:03.000> anti-gay<00:05:03.960> movements<00:05:04.410> if

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
lot of fuel to the anti-gay movements if

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.719 
lot of fuel to the anti-gay movements if
you

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
you

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.110 
you
call<00:05:04.969> them<00:05:05.089> that<00:05:06.460> because<00:05:07.460> they'll<00:05:07.819> be<00:05:07.939> like

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
call them that because they'll be like

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.719 
call them that because they'll be like
oh<00:05:08.270> it's<00:05:08.419> an<00:05:08.509> environmental<00:05:09.080> things<00:05:09.349> so<00:05:09.729> let's

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
oh it's an environmental things so let's

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.260 
oh it's an environmental things so let's
just<00:05:10.939> send<00:05:11.059> them<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:12.699> anti-gay<00:05:13.699> camps<00:05:14.150> or

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
just send them to the anti-gay camps or

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.089 
just send them to the anti-gay camps or
DJ<00:05:14.569> education<00:05:15.169> camps<00:05:15.620> or<00:05:15.770> whatever<00:05:16.009> that

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
DJ education camps or whatever that

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.320 
DJ education camps or whatever that
exists<00:05:16.849> out<00:05:16.969> there<00:05:16.999> and<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:18.099> and<00:05:19.099> then<00:05:19.759> we<00:05:20.180> can

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
exists out there and and and then we can

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.420 
exists out there and and and then we can
change<00:05:20.479> them<00:05:20.689> in<00:05:20.779> a<00:05:20.870> VA<00:05:21.020> straight<00:05:21.979> again<00:05:22.189> or

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
change them in a VA straight again or

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.290 
change them in a VA straight again or
whatever<00:05:22.699> and<00:05:22.849> it's<00:05:22.999> just<00:05:23.150> completely

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
whatever and it's just completely

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.570 
whatever and it's just completely
different<00:05:24.080> but<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.039> biggest<00:05:25.219> thing<00:05:25.430> that

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
different but the biggest thing that

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.999 
different but the biggest thing that
that<00:05:26.150> watching<00:05:26.599> these<00:05:26.749> videos<00:05:26.900> sort<00:05:27.469> of<00:05:27.559> made

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
that watching these videos sort of made

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.379 
that watching these videos sort of made
me<00:05:28.129> think<00:05:28.309> of<00:05:28.400> was<00:05:30.969> does<00:05:31.969> it<00:05:32.120> really<00:05:32.240> matter

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
me think of was does it really matter

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.350 
me think of was does it really matter
and<00:05:32.889> I<00:05:33.889> mean<00:05:34.460> some<00:05:34.789> of<00:05:34.879> the<00:05:34.939> other<00:05:35.059> research

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
and I mean some of the other research

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.179 
and I mean some of the other research
they<00:05:35.569> did<00:05:35.749> they<00:05:35.930> even<00:05:36.349> showed<00:05:36.559> her<00:05:36.740> they<00:05:36.979> they

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:37.189 
they did they even showed her they they

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.059 
they did they even showed her they they
did<00:05:37.339> this<00:05:37.460> gay<00:05:38.240> or<00:05:38.419> not<00:05:38.569> test<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.469> it<00:05:40.039> was

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
did this gay or not test and it was

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.950 
did this gay or not test and it was
completely<00:05:40.279> all<00:05:40.729> based<00:05:40.939> on<00:05:41.089> stereotypes<00:05:41.300> and

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
completely all based on stereotypes and

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.350 
completely all based on stereotypes and
like<00:05:44.960> a<00:05:45.169> gay<00:05:45.740> man<00:05:45.949> sits<00:05:46.460> with<00:05:46.939> his<00:05:47.089> legs

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
like a gay man sits with his legs

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.249 
like a gay man sits with his legs
crossed<00:05:47.749> in<00:05:47.960> a<00:05:48.020> more<00:05:48.199> effeminate<00:05:48.499> manner<00:05:48.830> or

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
crossed in a more effeminate manner or

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.589 
crossed in a more effeminate manner or
six<00:05:51.259> more<00:05:51.409> proper<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:51.949> on<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:52.159> slouch<00:05:52.490> or<00:05:53.059> has

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
six more proper and on the slouch or has

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.570 
six more proper and on the slouch or has
a<00:05:53.629> certain<00:05:53.949> inflection<00:05:54.949> in<00:05:55.069> their<00:05:55.219> voice<00:05:55.370> and

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
a certain inflection in their voice and

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.980 
a certain inflection in their voice and
there's<00:05:55.759> lots<00:05:55.969> and<00:05:56.240> lots<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.449> research<00:05:56.689> that

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
there's lots and lots of research that

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.719 
there's lots and lots of research that
goes<00:05:57.199> on<00:05:57.469> about<00:05:57.589> it<00:05:57.710> in<00:05:58.339> fact<00:05:58.490> if<00:05:58.639> you're

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
goes on about it in fact if you're

00:05:58.729 --> 00:05:59.739 
goes on about it in fact if you're
interested<00:05:59.089> there's<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.300> professor<00:05:59.629> at<00:05:59.689> the

00:05:59.739 --> 00:05:59.749 
interested there's a professor at the

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.950 
interested there's a professor at the
university<00:06:00.139> of<00:06:00.819> minnesota-twin<00:06:01.819> cities<00:06:02.360> that

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
university of minnesota-twin cities that

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.219 
university of minnesota-twin cities that
actually<00:06:03.439> studies<00:06:04.059> the<00:06:05.059> speech<00:06:05.300> pathology<00:06:05.990> of

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
actually studies the speech pathology of

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.170 
actually studies the speech pathology of
gay<00:06:07.069> people<00:06:07.370> versus<00:06:07.669> straight<00:06:07.849> people<00:06:08.089> and

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
gay people versus straight people and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.559 
gay people versus straight people and
it's<00:06:08.300> really<00:06:08.419> fascinating<00:06:08.659> research<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:10.569> but

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
it's really fascinating research but but

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:12.850 
it's really fascinating research but but
it's<00:06:11.719> still<00:06:11.899> it<00:06:12.110> begs<00:06:12.259> to<00:06:12.379> mind<00:06:12.560> does<00:06:12.740> it

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's still it begs to mind does it

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.089 
it's still it begs to mind does it
really<00:06:13.009> matter<00:06:13.219> should<00:06:13.969> we<00:06:14.589> study<00:06:15.589> stuff<00:06:15.949> like

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
really matter should we study stuff like

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.769 
really matter should we study stuff like
this<00:06:16.249> when<00:06:16.580> really<00:06:16.969> we're<00:06:17.330> just<00:06:17.539> people<00:06:17.629> like

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
this when really we're just people like

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.239 
this when really we're just people like
everyone<00:06:18.169> else<00:06:18.349> and<00:06:18.589> it's<00:06:18.770> not<00:06:18.889> like<00:06:19.039> we<00:06:19.129> have

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:19.249 
everyone else and it's not like we have

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:20.499 
everyone else and it's not like we have
a<00:06:19.279> disease<00:06:19.580> or<00:06:19.759> something<00:06:19.819> that<00:06:20.209> needs<00:06:20.360> to<00:06:20.389> be

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
a disease or something that needs to be

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.639 
a disease or something that needs to be
cured<00:06:20.779> or<00:06:20.930> something<00:06:21.229> needs<00:06:21.379> to<00:06:21.469> be<00:06:21.499> fixed<00:06:21.919> and

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:23.649 
cured or something needs to be fixed and

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.719 
cured or something needs to be fixed and
wouldn't<00:06:24.649> it<00:06:24.740> be<00:06:24.800> better<00:06:25.009> if<00:06:25.129> we<00:06:25.249> spent<00:06:25.550> our

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
wouldn't it be better if we spent our

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.469 
wouldn't it be better if we spent our
research<00:06:26.419> money<00:06:26.659> and<00:06:26.959> research<00:06:27.319> funds<00:06:27.800> on

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
research money and research funds on

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.290 
research money and research funds on
researching<00:06:29.479> things<00:06:29.810> like<00:06:30.669> cure<00:06:31.669> for<00:06:31.909> cures

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
researching things like cure for cures

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.079

tuberculosis<00:06:35.180> for<00:06:35.839> example<00:06:36.169> I<00:06:36.229> mean<00:06:36.349> that's

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
tuberculosis for example I mean that's

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.230 
tuberculosis for example I mean that's
inventing<00:06:36.860> the<00:06:36.949> news<00:06:37.099> lately<00:06:37.249> or<00:06:37.729> you<00:06:38.209> know

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
inventing the news lately or you know

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.029 
inventing the news lately or you know
something<00:06:38.629> put<00:06:39.589> more<00:06:39.709> money<00:06:39.830> into

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
something put more money into

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.459 
something put more money into
researching<00:06:40.430> AIDS<00:06:40.849> or<00:06:41.389> Alzheimer's<00:06:42.110> disease

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
or Parkinson's disease or you know

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.719 
or Parkinson's disease or you know
there's<00:06:44.479> so<00:06:44.629> many<00:06:44.719> things<00:06:44.839> that<00:06:45.139> we<00:06:45.319> could<00:06:45.729> be

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
there's so many things that we could be

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.209 
there's so many things that we could be
spending<00:06:47.180> our<00:06:47.449> time<00:06:47.659> on<00:06:47.870> that<00:06:48.050> are<00:06:48.219> that

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
spending our time on that are that

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:51.100 
spending our time on that are that
actually<00:06:49.639> do<00:06:49.789> matter<00:06:49.999> and<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.360> me<00:06:50.629> this<00:06:50.809> this

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
actually do matter and to me this this

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.719 
actually do matter and to me this this
is<00:06:51.289> really<00:06:51.469> should<00:06:51.889> be<00:06:51.979> a<00:06:52.009> moot<00:06:52.279> issue<00:06:52.430> it

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
is really should be a moot issue it

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.429 
is really should be a moot issue it
should<00:06:52.879> not<00:06:52.999> be<00:06:53.059> something<00:06:53.509> that<00:06:53.539> people<00:06:54.319> are

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
should not be something that people are

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.249 
should not be something that people are
so<00:06:54.620> overly<00:06:55.009> concerned<00:06:55.339> about<00:06:55.550> and<00:06:55.759> I<00:06:56.689> just

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
so overly concerned about and I just

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.100 
so overly concerned about and I just
think<00:06:57.409> that's<00:06:57.559> kind<00:06:57.740> of<00:06:57.770> sad<00:06:58.360> anyway<00:06:59.360> I'd<00:06:59.839> love
