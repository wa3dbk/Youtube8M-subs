00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
bicycle okay that's why they gave me the

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.129 
bicycle okay that's why they gave me the
record<00:03:17.670> every<00:03:18.150> kind<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.359> by<00:03:18.480> bicycle<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.109> know

record every kind of by bicycle you know

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.890 
record every kind of by bicycle you know
but<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.920> every<00:03:20.579> country<00:03:20.760> or<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.720> most

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
traveled bicycle or not you know so I at

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.580 
traveled bicycle or not you know so I at
that<00:03:27.209> time<00:03:27.650> they<00:03:29.000> had<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> find<00:03:30.299> another

that time they had to find another
another<00:03:31.590> gold<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:33.419> was<00:03:33.599> like<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
regions or what they how they called it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.740 
regions or what they how they called it
you<00:03:46.169> know<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.829> what<00:03:47.639> is<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.299> where<00:03:48.510> what

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you know and what is it what where what

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.539 
you know and what is it what where what
God<00:03:48.989> played<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> had<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.069> list<00:03:50.250> you

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
God played and so I had the list you

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.949 
God played and so I had the list you
know<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.879> then<00:03:51.389> after<00:03:52.049> 96<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:53.150> decided<00:03:54.150> well

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
know and then after 96 I decided well

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.069 
know and then after 96 I decided well
I'm<00:03:55.410> going<00:03:55.859> at<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.669> work<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.359> making<00:03:57.810> all

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
I'm going at the work of making all

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.369 
I'm going at the work of making all
those<00:03:59.150> territories<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.389> regions<00:04:00.599> as<00:04:01.049> well

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
those territories and regions as well

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.229 
those territories and regions as well
and<00:04:01.680> I'm<00:04:01.799> basically<00:04:02.280> still<00:04:02.639> at<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.940> because

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
and I'm basically still at it because

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.849 
and I'm basically still at it because
there's<00:04:03.480> some<00:04:03.690> reason<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.019> impossible<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.739> go

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
there's some reason is impossible to go

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.830 
there's some reason is impossible to go
to<00:04:04.889> unless<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.459> have<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.639> lot<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> money<00:04:06.000> or<00:04:06.780> you

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to unless you have a lot of money or you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.050 
to unless you have a lot of money or you
have<00:04:06.959> your<00:04:07.079> own<00:04:07.169> shape

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.080 

well<00:04:15.060> at<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.990> present<00:04:16.200> all<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.130> last<00:04:17.370> few<00:04:17.820> yet

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
well at the present all the last few yet

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.370 
well at the present all the last few yet
more<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> last<00:04:19.079> few<00:04:19.470> years<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:21.090> been

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.080 

another<00:04:25.380> one<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.830> those<00:04:26.040> things<00:04:26.310> first<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:27.000> all

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
another one of those things first of all

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.050 
another one of those things first of all
is<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.540> make<00:04:27.900> all<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.230> countries<00:04:28.620> but<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.910> all

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
is to make all the countries but to all

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.270 
is to make all the countries but to all
all<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.510> remaining<00:04:30.840> places<00:04:31.500> but<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.130> other

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
all the remaining places but the other

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.220 
all the remaining places but the other
thing<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.670> I<00:04:32.700> also<00:04:33.120> don't<00:04:33.600> want<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.960> abandon

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
thing is I also don't want to abandon

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.060 
thing is I also don't want to abandon
cycling<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.310> I've<00:04:35.490> set<00:04:36.120> myself<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.750> second<00:04:37.230> goal

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
cycling so I've set myself a second goal

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.490 
cycling so I've set myself a second goal
and<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.460> 12,000<00:04:39.420> kilometres<00:04:39.570> play<00:04:40.110> here

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
and that is 12,000 kilometres play here

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.620 
and that is 12,000 kilometres play here
on<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.010> bicycle<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.580> know<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:42.180> how<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.390> you

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
on the bicycle you know so how can you

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.210 
on the bicycle you know so how can you
do<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.930> if<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:43.380> have<00:04:43.560> Islands<00:04:44.070> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
do that if you just have Islands and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.760 
do that if you just have Islands and
there's<00:04:44.820> one<00:04:45.090> month<00:04:45.330> one<00:04:45.930> transporte<00:04:46.530> in<00:04:46.590> one

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
there's one month one transporte in one

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.090 
there's one month one transporte in one
month<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.220> can't<00:04:47.490> do<00:04:47.640> that<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.270> try<00:04:48.840> to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
month you can't do that so I try to

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.159 
month you can't do that so I try to
combine<00:04:50.100> those<00:04:50.850> things<00:04:51.210> get<00:04:51.480> close<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
combine those things get close to the

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.380 
combine those things get close to the
places<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.800> are<00:04:53.070> missing<00:04:53.400> which<00:04:53.910> are<00:04:54.090> mostly

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
places that are missing which are mostly

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.680 
places that are missing which are mostly
islands<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.200> at<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.950> same<00:04:56.160> time<00:04:56.490> find<00:04:56.910> places

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
islands and at the same time find places

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.680 
islands and at the same time find places
new<00:04:58.260> places<00:04:58.620> new<00:04:58.919> routes<00:04:59.430> where<00:04:59.970> can<00:05:00.240> write

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
new places new routes where can write

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.800 
new places new routes where can write
the<00:05:00.870> bicycle<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.550> solution<00:05:03.030> is<00:05:03.180> around

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the bicycle so the solution is around

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.450 
the bicycle so the solution is around
the<00:05:03.960> world<00:05:03.990> tickets<00:05:04.500> around<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.310> world

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
the world tickets around the world

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.820 
the world tickets around the world
tickets<00:05:05.790> allow<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.090> for<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.419> fixed<00:05:06.660> price<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:07.260> a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
ticket you can stop in many places you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.960 
ticket you can stop in many places you
can<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.410> close<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.740> those<00:05:11.100> places<00:05:11.460> because<00:05:11.790> of

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
can get close to those places because of

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.360 
can get close to those places because of
islands<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.720> things<00:05:12.930> okay<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.410> then<00:05:13.770> locally

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
islands and things okay and then locally

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.520 
islands and things okay and then locally
you<00:05:14.460> can<00:05:14.669> get<00:05:14.850> another<00:05:15.510> flight<00:05:15.840> or<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:16.229> to<00:05:16.290> an

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
you can get another flight or so to an

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.280 
you can get another flight or so to an
island<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.460> at<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.240> same<00:05:18.450> time<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.870> can<00:05:19.080> say

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
island and at the same time you can say
