I have had a hard time wrestling with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.410 
I have had a hard time wrestling with
other<00:00:45.690> cuts<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.350> Laura's<00:00:47.010> albums<00:00:47.489> songs<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
other cuts on Laura's albums songs that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
other cuts on Laura's albums songs that
might<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> tendency<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.739> guess

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
might have the tendency to I guess

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.450 
might have the tendency to I guess
wander<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.879> bit<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.590> meander<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> maybe

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
wander a little bit in meander and maybe

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.869 
wander a little bit in meander and maybe
feel<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.180> obtuse<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:55.230> esoteric<00:00:55.980> because

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
feel a little obtuse or esoteric because

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.849 
feel a little obtuse or esoteric because
of<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.149> usually<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.170> Laura's<00:00:58.440> music<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
of that usually I think Laura's music is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.860 
of that usually I think Laura's music is
pretty<00:00:59.010> meditative<00:00:59.789> though<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.420> always

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
pretty meditative though not always

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
pretty meditative though not always
memorable<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> stuck<00:01:02.969> in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

them with the I guess the the tact and

things<00:04:24.300> because<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:25.050> second<00:04:25.380> verse

things because the second verse
we<00:04:26.280> were<00:04:26.370> hearing<00:04:26.730> a<00:04:26.820> story<00:04:27.030> about<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.240> totally

stepping<00:05:16.320> outside<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.770> your<00:05:16.890> comfort<00:05:17.040> zone

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
stepping outside of your comfort zone

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.670 
stepping outside of your comfort zone
however<00:05:18.570> with<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:18.930> track<00:05:19.170> I<00:05:19.290> feel<00:05:19.440> like<00:05:19.560> the

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
however with this track I feel like the

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.260 
however with this track I feel like the
risk<00:05:19.950> that's<00:05:20.160> being<00:05:20.340> talked<00:05:20.640> about<00:05:20.760> here<00:05:21.150> is

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
risk that's being talked about here is

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.890 
risk that's being talked about here is
just<00:05:22.020> being<00:05:22.380> honest<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.160> being<00:05:23.550> really<00:05:23.910> frank

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
just being honest and being really frank

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.140 
just being honest and being really frank
which<00:05:25.200> is<00:05:25.350> not<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.800> be<00:05:25.830> misconstrued<00:05:26.490> with

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
which is not to be misconstrued with

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.780 
which is not to be misconstrued with
being<00:05:27.480> daring<00:05:28.350> which<00:05:28.710> despite<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.370> efforts

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
being daring which despite the efforts

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.120 
being daring which despite the efforts
made<00:05:29.910> on<00:05:30.360> this<00:05:30.510> album<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:31.110> don't<00:05:31.320> think<00:05:31.560> this

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
made on this album I don't think this

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.610 
made on this album I don't think this
album<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.450> even<00:05:33.930> though<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.050> do<00:05:34.110> like<00:05:34.350> a<00:05:34.380> lot

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
album is and even though I do like a lot

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
of this LP I'm not completely head over

of this LP I'm not completely head over
heels<00:05:37.170> for<00:05:37.320> it<00:05:37.620> some<00:05:38.040> songs<00:05:38.310> I'm<00:05:38.520> just<00:05:38.700> kind<00:05:38.850> of

heels for it some songs I'm just kind of

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.580 
heels for it some songs I'm just kind of

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
so so instrumental and a really

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.180 
so so instrumental and a really
prominent<00:05:44.670> drum<00:05:45.090> beat<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.480> sounds<00:05:45.810> like

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
prominent drum beat that sounds like

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.460 
prominent drum beat that sounds like
someone's<00:05:47.190> smacking<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.210> trash<00:05:48.840> can<00:05:49.260> which

someone's smacking a trash can which

someone's smacking a trash can which
really<00:05:49.740> does<00:05:49.950> not<00:05:49.980> compliment<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.090> song<00:05:51.300> that

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
really does not compliment the song that

really does not compliment the song that

singing<00:05:54.750> on<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.140> record<00:05:55.500> gets<00:05:55.680> a<00:05:55.920> little

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
singing on this record gets a little

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.180 
singing on this record gets a little
stale<00:05:56.850> sometimes<00:05:57.510> specifically<00:05:58.110> on<00:05:58.260> the

stale sometimes specifically on the

intensifying<00:06:02.300> instrumentation<00:06:03.300> Laura's

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
intensifying instrumentation Laura's

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.980 
intensifying instrumentation Laura's
performances<00:06:04.890> really<00:06:05.700> just<00:06:05.940> kind<00:06:06.420> of<00:06:06.600> subdued

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
performances really just kind of subdued

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.920 
performances really just kind of subdued
and<00:06:07.500> as<00:06:08.190> she<00:06:08.400> tries<00:06:08.670> to<00:06:08.910> pick<00:06:09.180> up<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.480> volume

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
and as she tries to pick up the volume

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.930 
and as she tries to pick up the volume
and<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:10.500> passion<00:06:11.040> toward<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.430> back<00:06:11.640> end<00:06:11.850> of

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
and the passion toward the back end of

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.390 
and the passion toward the back end of
the<00:06:12.000> track<00:06:12.300> she<00:06:13.020> actually<00:06:13.170> strains<00:06:13.860> her<00:06:14.160> voice

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
the track she actually strains her voice

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.180 
the track she actually strains her voice
pretty<00:06:15.150> audibly<00:06:15.780> which<00:06:16.170> I<00:06:16.320> think<00:06:16.590> in<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.920> mix

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
pretty audibly which I think in the mix

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.590 
pretty audibly which I think in the mix
they<00:06:17.430> might<00:06:17.580> have<00:06:17.700> tried<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.030> mask<00:06:18.300> by

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
they might have tried to mask by

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.450 
they might have tried to mask by
bringing<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.080> guitars<00:06:19.410> up<00:06:19.650> a<00:06:19.800> little<00:06:20.220> louder

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
bringing the guitars up a little louder

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.090 
bringing the guitars up a little louder
but<00:06:20.610> it's<00:06:20.880> still<00:06:21.120> very<00:06:21.180> very<00:06:21.900> clear<00:06:22.380> some<00:06:22.890> of

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
but it's still very very clear some of

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.680 
but it's still very very clear some of
Laura's<00:06:23.400> older<00:06:23.730> work<00:06:23.910> I<00:06:24.090> found<00:06:24.300> to<00:06:24.390> be<00:06:24.450> just<00:06:24.570> a

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
Laura's older work I found to be just a

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.770 
Laura's older work I found to be just a
little<00:06:24.720> too<00:06:25.110> quiet<00:06:25.650> and<00:06:26.570> indirect<00:06:27.570> and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
little too quiet and indirect and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.930 
little too quiet and indirect and
standoffish<00:06:28.350> and<00:06:28.860> as<00:06:29.070> she<00:06:29.370> has<00:06:29.490> tried<00:06:29.730> to<00:06:29.820> be

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
standoffish and as she has tried to be

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.790 
standoffish and as she has tried to be
more<00:06:30.120> straightforward<00:06:30.420> with<00:06:30.810> this<00:06:30.960> album<00:06:31.380> I

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
more straightforward with this album I

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.920 
more straightforward with this album I
don't<00:06:32.250> think<00:06:32.460> it's<00:06:32.580> totally<00:06:32.760> you<00:06:33.390> know<00:06:33.420> fixed

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
don't think it's totally you know fixed

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.290 
don't think it's totally you know fixed
every<00:06:34.260> issue<00:06:34.500> I<00:06:34.680> think<00:06:34.890> a<00:06:35.280> while<00:06:35.550> it<00:06:35.880> is<00:06:36.090> an

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
every issue I think a while it is an

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.320 
every issue I think a while it is an
improvement<00:06:36.630> in<00:06:36.840> a<00:06:36.900> way<00:06:37.110> new<00:06:38.040> problems<00:06:38.669> have

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
improvement in a way new problems have

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.659 
improvement in a way new problems have
in<00:06:39.389> a<00:06:39.689> sense<00:06:39.960> and<00:06:40.319> there<00:06:40.800> are<00:06:40.919> songs<00:06:41.220> on<00:06:41.460> here

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
in a sense and there are songs on here

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.760 
in a sense and there are songs on here
such<00:06:41.879> as<00:06:42.030> howl<00:06:42.240> which<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:42.990> me<00:06:43.110> are<00:06:43.289> just<00:06:43.319> as

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
such as howl which to me are just as

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.670 
such as howl which to me are just as
sleepy<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:44.960> slow-motion<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.199> impenetrable

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
sleepy and slow-motion and impenetrable

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.760 
sleepy and slow-motion and impenetrable
as<00:06:47.310> some<00:06:47.789> of<00:06:47.909> Laura's<00:06:48.270> older<00:06:48.569> stuff<00:06:48.870> so<00:06:49.409> that's

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
as some of Laura's older stuff so that's

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.230 
as some of Laura's older stuff so that's
not<00:06:49.860> really<00:06:50.099> a<00:06:50.129> vibe<00:06:50.460> or<00:06:50.490> a<00:06:50.759> sound<00:06:51.030> or

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
not really a vibe or a sound or

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.540 
not really a vibe or a sound or
direction<00:06:51.750> she's<00:06:51.960> overcome<00:06:52.770> entirely<00:06:53.159> with

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
direction she's overcome entirely with

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.939 
direction she's overcome entirely with
this<00:06:53.729> album<00:06:54.090> nor<00:06:54.930> do<00:06:55.199> I<00:06:55.259> think<00:06:55.349> that<00:06:55.710> was

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
this album nor do I think that was

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.129 
this album nor do I think that was
something<00:06:56.099> she<00:06:56.310> was<00:06:56.400> trying<00:06:56.759> to<00:06:56.939> do

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
something she was trying to do

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.020 
something she was trying to do
intentionally<00:06:58.139> throughout<00:06:58.800> the<00:06:59.310> entire<00:06:59.639> LP

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
intentionally throughout the entire LP

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.670 
intentionally throughout the entire LP
anyway<00:07:00.389> overall<00:07:01.020> this<00:07:01.139> is<00:07:01.199> pretty<00:07:01.439> decent

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
anyway overall this is pretty decent

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.619 
anyway overall this is pretty decent
singer-songwriter<00:07:02.550> album<00:07:03.060> like<00:07:03.360> I<00:07:03.479> said
