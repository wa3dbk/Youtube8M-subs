00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829

passes<00:06:07.440> a<00:06:07.470> piece<00:06:08.060> maybe<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.210> game<00:06:09.389> would<00:06:09.509> have

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
passes a piece maybe the game would have

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.990 
passes a piece maybe the game would have
