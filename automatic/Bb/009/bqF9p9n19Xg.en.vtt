00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello guys had everything well 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.009
 This is another video lesson and in this class. 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.290
 we will show a very simple method for 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.710
 find prime numbers 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.910
 this method is known as a method of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.330
 erythostenes or also sieve 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.550
 thorsten for those who have never heard of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.630
 subject was tottenham was a philosopher 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 Greek 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.690
 author of several important works for the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.160
 humanity and one of its most 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 was to calculate the circumference of the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.140
 of planet earth 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.870
 but this is for the other class 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 good, let's go, the first step is to choose 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 approximately until the value goes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 find the prime numbers 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.550
 I'm going to work until number 50 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 so first build a list with 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.859
 all natural numbers up to the number 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.859
 50 starting from number 2 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.020
 from here it marks the first number 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.110
 which is logical the very number 2 and in 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.030
 followed by school all multiples of 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.060
 value you just dialed 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:24.380
 in this case the 4 1 168 and will repeat in that 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 process to the end of the list reminding 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.290
 that it is important that you continue 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.630
 count to the end and do not mark or 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.240
 delete other numbers for now 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.979
 even knowing whether or not they are numbers 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.979
 cousins not to get lost 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.710
 now with every list made, mark the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.409
 next number that is 31 and repeat the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.119
 previous process excluding all 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.280
 your multiples 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.400
 At this moment we will realize that there are 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.110
 some values and are already excluded as 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.360
 the number 6 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.149
 but keep doing the same count 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.210
 until the end because as each number 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.360
 marked depends on the previous value 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 any error will generate a new error 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.880
 any wrong marking can 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.010
 delete the prime number and say versa 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.980
 as soon as you finish the list with the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.410
 multiples of 3 mark the next number but 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
 be careful as we will already exclude the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.730
 number 4 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.190
 the next number to be dialed 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.910
 is 5 and then as in previous ones 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.790
 school all multiples now value 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.460
 which will be worked on 17 and again 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.590
 be careful because even in the beginning 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.450
 there seemed to be no more numbers 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.760
 to be excluded 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.370
 there may be some hidden value in the middle 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.180
 or at the bottom of the list 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:59.620
 so do not change the value until you have 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 the entire list at the beginning of the 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.440
 process seems to be very laborious but 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.510
 if you're watching 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.100
 The higher the value you are 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.390
 Checking faster is getting your 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:20.860
 counts as they will have fewer multiples 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.750
 be counted and to be excluded and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.990
 if you still think you're giving too much 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.050
 work do not worry, you just 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.930
 will keep counting until half of the 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.750
 your list that in our case as the list 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.120
 going until 50 you just need to check it out 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.900
 pass number 25 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.260
 why any value above 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.630
 if there will not be more multiples in the list 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.840
 all other values that are not 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:55.120
 were excluded until that moment 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.670
 will also be marked and now with all 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.180
 the numbers checked here are all 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.620
 the first prime numbers up to 51 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:12.390
 ascending order 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:16.350
 o 2o 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.670
 and 47 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.609
 this method is valid for any 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:25.450
 quantity is just to assemble a list of the 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.360
 size you prefer and scoring and a 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.350
 Great tip if only table was a little 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.130
 extensive 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.810
 is assembling a computer first 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.450
 That's what it's all about and who's a teacher. 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.310
 this is an excellent activity even 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.680
 to change the dynamics of classes a bit 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.720
 mathematics and can be developed 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.780
 for students from teaching 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.430
 fundamental 2 or to anyone 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.070
 who wishes to ask doubts of countless 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.260
 awards and if you are a student show this 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.140
 activity for teachers and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.660
 roommates now if it's a parent 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.360
 such activity along with 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.300
 their children instead of just sending the 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.270
 for cuts there alone because this is 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.970
 a great opportunity to follow the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.009
 development 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.199
 well if you liked it 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.030
 do not forget to give a young man had and if 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.460
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.270
 I'm staying here a big hug and 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.270
 to the next
