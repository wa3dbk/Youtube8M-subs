00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.900
 many times when traveling we do not know what 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.629
 when we get to sightsee by 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.850
 Some city is important to enjoy 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.740
 a nice day without getting tired but that 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.020
 yes ready for the souvenir photos by 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.250
 that assemble these four looks so that 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.250
 look nice and comfortable 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.210
 this is the first option obviously a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.250
 short dress would not be good option 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.380
 because obviously we would not be 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.689
 comfortable we would have to cover ourselves and 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.550
 take care of us a lot but a maxivestido yes 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.590
 it is you choose the one that most 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.330
 like there are some that go printed 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.910
 completely like this but also the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.830
 alders and the cut also I chose something 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.860
 loose but there is also because 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.590
 waist the round neckline I preferred 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.410
 something in you see you choose the one that 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.000
 it favors them clearly that also 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.220
 cities sometimes changes a lot the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.140
 weather so a sweater never quoted 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.720
 It is over and if it is thin and cute 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.610
 much better I chose this in pink 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.440
 I like the contrast that makes 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.650
 from pastel pink to no longer use colors 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.810
 intense has very little coverage the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.810
 it's true that it reaches the middle of the arm 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.970
 then nothing else is to be cool 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.490
 I'm wearing some low shoes that are 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.350
 the best option and closed I feel that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.409
 it's not sandals on this occasion 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.210
 would be the ideal option because then you can 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.010
 that there is a stone some glass or 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.230
 anything a few shoes closed to 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.420
 do 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.950
 I'm wearing a hat to cover me 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.110
 of the sun and also because it looks amazing 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.030
 with this look there are blacks there are 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.430
 white with ribbons of different 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.040
 colors you choose your favorite and 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.440
 finally a bag this bag says that 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.180
 I have to grab it goes the side and I can 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.110
 put only what is necessary to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 enjoy the ride 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.530
 a tourist with a rocker style look 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.080
 to start with some black leggings 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580
 These can not be missing in your closet 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.440
 they make themselves look thin legs and 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.940
 very stylized and we can also 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.160
 combine them with all colors 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.840
 in this case the top that I chose is very 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.479
 long because when we are leggins 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.700
 We use shirts shirts or tops for 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.100
 down the pompeu this is gray 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 has some Dutch in the lower part 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.780
 has no cut is completely 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.430
 loose and it looks really good the boots are 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.980
 ideal also to go sightseeing 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 because they have a tractor sole 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 I'll slip I will not spend anything 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.860
 but I really wanted them to be fun 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.690
 and that they had wave if they are fixed have 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.700
 I really like this 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.100
 trend also never going to happen 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.690
 I'm using fashion as an accessory 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.580
 band in the head also with 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.940
 and based on this 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.700
 combination of silver and black is gray 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.620
 he sees incredible is very harmonious too 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 I like this bag because it's so big 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.960
 then I will be able to charge the camera 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.360
 photos on the maps everything you need is 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.810
 still seeing very well and is ideal for 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.810
 this world 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.150
 and this option is perfect for a day 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.189
 sunny a short skirt if they are fixed no 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.560
 back back york then let's go to 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.780
 To be very comfortable, it is very white and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.359
 black in many colors also 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.040
 they are all look amazing I wanted to use 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.590
 a black shirt to make contrast 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.810
 black and white you could use another 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.519
 kind of top 16 that was a shirt 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.519
 simple but there are touches in cloud collar 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.939
 of tirant one shoulder milestones what 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.739
 want I'm wearing patterned tennis on 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.389
 Leopard is the state that I like the most 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.859
 in fact it also makes very good 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.689
 combination with white and black 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.659
 as we had already talked about in 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.609
 past programs I'm using a 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.919
 pashmina that is kind of like 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.019
 Very large mask is ideal for the 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.790
 heat because it's very cool has the 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.290
 stamping also of anima paint 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.450
 of other colors that are very nice in 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.480
 game with these that we are seeing in the 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.639
 look some lenses to cover the sun 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 they also look incredible choose the 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.060
 design that you like most obviously 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.700

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.780
 very nice 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.920

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.600
 gifted of achieving jeans that 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.060
 more like them if they want flared 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.340
 cold is a tonality that goes very well 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.320
 with blue and with white 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.050

 some apps out there I'm 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.640
 finally using a bag that is 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.290
 I'm not going to have to carry a bag either 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.420
 I take it from the side and it has a size 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.420
