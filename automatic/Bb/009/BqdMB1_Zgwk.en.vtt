the windmill is also known as a

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.920 
the windmill is also known as a
continuous<00:00:04.500> backspin<00:00:05.360> because<00:00:06.360> it<00:00:06.510> takes<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
continuous backspin because it takes the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.169 
continuous backspin because it takes the
transition<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:07.620> your<00:00:07.800> baby<00:00:07.950> freeze<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:09.030> your

again<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.559> windmill<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.280> drop<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
again in the windmill as you drop it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
again in the windmill as you drop it
would<00:00:54.090> drop<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> shoulder<00:00:55.399> back<00:00:56.399> around

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
would drop to the shoulder back around

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
would drop to the shoulder back around
as<00:00:56.970> you<00:00:57.059> would<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> backspin<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.160> come<00:00:59.340> around

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
as you would a backspin and come around

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
as you would a backspin and come around
again<00:00:59.790> into<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> baby<00:01:00.930> freeze<00:01:02.989> practice<00:01:03.989> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

again into the baby freeze practice this
at<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.620> drill<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.760> window<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.870> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
at the drill for your window this is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
at the drill for your window this is
something<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.090> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
something that you have to do so you can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
something that you have to do so you can
get<00:01:09.390> used<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.780> how<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.620> body<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.190> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
get used to how to get that body up and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
get used to how to get that body up and
then<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> same<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:13.020> building<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
then all the same time is building you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.980 
then all the same time is building you
how<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.220> left<00:01:14.460> leg<00:01:14.850> whipping<00:01:15.420> toss

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
how to get that left leg whipping toss

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.430 
how to get that left leg whipping toss
and<00:01:16.290> around<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.640> clean<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
and around that's very clean I want to

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.600 
and around that's very clean I want to
see<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.920> drop<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.760> back<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> baby

boom one drop back to the baby because

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.490 
boom one drop back to the baby because
it'll<00:01:27.600> show<00:01:27.960> me<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.320> building

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it'll show me that you're building

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.090 
it'll show me that you're building

start achieving the windmill in its full
execution<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.490> biggest<00:02:01.790> challenge<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.540> that

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
execution the biggest challenge is that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.140 
execution the biggest challenge is that
how<00:02:03.170> do<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.470> come<00:02:03.830> around<00:02:03.950> for<00:02:04.280> my<00:02:04.370> back<00:02:04.640> how

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
how do I come around for my back how

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.550 
how do I come around for my back how
that<00:02:05.330> come<00:02:05.479> around<00:02:05.570> that's<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.110> kind<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.350> free

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
that come around that's a kind of free

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.840 
that come around that's a kind of free
hand<00:02:06.740> is<00:02:06.830> very<00:02:06.860> point<00:02:07.310> where<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.490> come<00:02:07.729> around

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
hand is very point where you come around

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.690 
hand is very point where you come around
that<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.750> protecting<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.500> face<00:02:09.679> your<00:02:10.550> head

that is protecting your face your head

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.490 
that is protecting your face your head
should<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:10.970> in<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> same<00:02:11.270> direction<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.200> when

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
should be in the same direction so when

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.060 
should be in the same direction so when
as<00:02:12.590> soon<00:02:12.740> as<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:12.920> comes<00:02:13.100> up<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.780> grab<00:02:15.110> adjust

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
as soon as it comes up you grab adjust

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.480 
as soon as it comes up you grab adjust
and<00:02:17.060> then<00:02:17.209> pull<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.470> power<00:02:18.650> hand<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:19.130> pushes

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
and then pull the power hand just pushes

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.730 
and then pull the power hand just pushes
away<00:02:19.610> pushes<00:02:20.570> away<00:02:20.690> it's<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.350> if<00:02:21.440> somebody's

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
away pushes away it's like if somebody's

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.130 
away pushes away it's like if somebody's
making<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.160> sing<00:02:22.400> their<00:02:22.640> way<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.810> happens
