series<00:00:05.870> taking<00:00:06.870> off<00:00:07.110> the<00:00:07.640> gas<00:00:08.640> tank<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.480> can

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
series taking off the gas tank so we can

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
series taking off the gas tank so we can
do<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> fuel<00:00:10.140> pump<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.680> just<00:00:10.830> gonna<00:00:10.920> take

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
do the fuel pump we're just gonna take

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.629 
do the fuel pump we're just gonna take
the<00:00:11.340> fuel<00:00:11.580> pressure<00:00:11.760> regulator<00:00:12.180> off<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.870> the

the fuel pressure regulator off of the
factory<00:00:14.639> fuel<00:00:14.849> pump<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.330> should<00:00:15.480> run<00:00:15.599> around

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
factory fuel pump it should run around

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.080

only<00:00:18.240> need<00:00:18.420> 73<00:00:18.930> pounds<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.470> don't<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
only need 73 pounds so we don't have to

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.730 
only need 73 pounds so we don't have to
put<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.190> a<00:00:20.279> booster<00:00:20.670> pump<00:00:21.289> we'll<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.619> over

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
put in a booster pump we'll just go over

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.299 
put in a booster pump we'll just go over
here<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:24.410> this<00:00:25.410> gas<00:00:25.710> tank<00:00:30.859> get<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.009> underneath

and around in the general area over here
that<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.899> got<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.229> find<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.859> weld<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:27.359> plug

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
that you got to find and weld up or plug

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.749 
that you got to find and weld up or plug
up<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:27.990> bolt<00:01:28.219> they're<00:01:29.219> only<00:01:29.369> gonna<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.609> run

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
up with a bolt they're only gonna be run

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
up with a bolt they're only gonna be run
in<00:01:29.880> low<00:01:29.999> boost<00:01:30.240> shouldn't<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.929> too<00:01:31.079> bad<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.950> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
in low boost shouldn't be too bad now I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.469 
in low boost shouldn't be too bad now I
got<00:01:32.249> the<00:01:32.369> fuel<00:01:32.609> lines<00:01:32.819> down<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.419> were

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
got the fuel lines down here we were

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.519 
got the fuel lines down here we were
about<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.139> I<00:01:34.289> said<00:01:34.499> do<00:01:35.459> the<00:01:35.579> gas<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.529> get

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.529 
about to like I said do the gas and get

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:38.779 
about to like I said do the gas and get
that<00:01:37.709> thing<00:01:37.889> pumping<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.399> right<00:01:38.549> fuel

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
that thing pumping the right fuel

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.419 
that thing pumping the right fuel
pressure<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> get<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.539> actually<00:01:39.899> plumbed<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
pressure and get it actually plumbed in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.679 
pressure and get it actually plumbed in
so<00:01:41.429> that<00:01:41.609> we're<00:01:41.729> running<00:01:41.880> off<00:01:42.179> of<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:42.509> fuel

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so that we're running off of the fuel

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
so that we're running off of the fuel
pressure<00:01:42.869> regulator<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.429> airbox

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pressure regulator and get the airbox

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.779 
pressure regulator and get the airbox
cleaned<00:01:45.239> up<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.279> some<00:01:47.459> custom

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
cleaned up you have to do some custom

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.249 
cleaned up you have to do some custom
welding<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.239> it<00:01:48.359> so<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> bikes<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
welding on it so the bikes just going to

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.099 
welding on it so the bikes just going to
sit<00:01:49.499> for<00:01:49.529> a<00:01:49.739> minute<00:01:50.179> charge<00:01:51.179> piping<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.989> be

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
sit for a minute charge piping has to be

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.889 
sit for a minute charge piping has to be
cut<00:01:52.319> up<00:01:52.349> and<00:01:52.649> moved<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:54.689> where

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
cut up and moved but that's about where

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.229 
cut up and moved but that's about where
it's<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> go<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:56.429> little<00:01:56.549> reservoir

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
it's going to go that little reservoir

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.120 
it's going to go that little reservoir
there<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.599> gonna<00:01:57.719> move<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.499> it'll<00:01:59.009> be

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there is gonna move and it'll be

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.789 
there is gonna move and it'll be
bracketed<00:01:59.759> right<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:00.439> sit<00:02:01.439> right<00:02:01.590> back

bracketed right there sit right back

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.339 
bracketed right there sit right back
there<00:02:02.099> up<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.389> we'll<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.809> push

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
there up and down so we'll actually push

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:07.879 
there up and down so we'll actually push
out<00:02:04.559> the<00:02:05.659> coolant<00:02:06.659> we've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.559> our<00:02:07.649> pieces

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
out the coolant we've got our pieces

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.580 
out the coolant we've got our pieces
over<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.489> course<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.929> nitrous<00:02:10.289> bottle

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
over here of course the nitrous bottle

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.190 
over here of course the nitrous bottle
is<00:02:10.679> freakin<00:02:11.129> huge<00:02:11.599> but<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.019> work

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
is freakin huge but it's going to work

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
is freakin huge but it's going to work
because<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.620> use

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
because we use

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.570 
because we use
nitrous<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.319> cool<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.680> off<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:15.040> an<00:02:15.220> intercooler

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
nitrous to cool it off as an intercooler

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.080 
nitrous to cool it off as an intercooler
so<00:02:16.330> we<00:02:16.599> have<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.959> run<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.590> much<00:02:17.800> nitrous<00:02:18.280> it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
so we have to run that much nitrous it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.670 
so we have to run that much nitrous it
looks<00:02:19.269> kind<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> silly<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.840> some<00:02:20.110> guys<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:20.650> I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
looks kind of silly to some guys but I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.160 
looks kind of silly to some guys but I
like<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.269> looks<00:02:22.269> tough<00:02:22.480> as<00:02:22.629> hell<00:02:22.810> when<00:02:23.019> it's

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
like it looks tough as hell when it's

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.890 
like it looks tough as hell when it's
put<00:02:23.290> together<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.180> that's<00:02:25.480> pretty<00:02:25.750> much

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
put together so and that's pretty much

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.119 
put together so and that's pretty much
where<00:02:26.110> we're<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.410> we've<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> blow-off

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
where we're at we've got the blow-off

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.470 
where we're at we've got the blow-off
valve<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.980> still<00:02:29.980> annoyed<00:02:30.220> we've<00:02:31.060> got<00:02:31.269> some

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
valve and still annoyed we've got some

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.059 
valve and still annoyed we've got some
other<00:02:31.750> line<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:32.379> going<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> run<00:02:32.769> for

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
other line that we're going to run for

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.770 
other line that we're going to run for
our<00:02:33.280> cooling<00:02:35.849> go<00:02:36.849> ahead<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.090> still<00:02:37.360> braid<00:02:37.599> up

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
our cooling go ahead and still braid up

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.360 
our cooling go ahead and still braid up
some<00:02:37.989> other<00:02:38.140> lines<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.620> way<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.950> looks<00:02:39.129> nice

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
some other lines that way it looks nice

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.930 
some other lines that way it looks nice
to<00:02:39.519> tie<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to tie it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.650 
to tie it
get<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.510> tucked<00:02:40.720> in<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.330> waiting

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
get it tucked in and it's just waiting

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.690 
get it tucked in and it's just waiting
on<00:02:43.690> some<00:02:43.900> parts<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.129> we'll<00:02:45.220> get<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.489> thing

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
on some parts and we'll get this thing

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.009 
on some parts and we'll get this thing
running<00:02:45.880> here<00:02:46.299> still<00:02:46.569> got<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.780> build<00:02:46.930> a

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
running here still got to build a

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.309 
running here still got to build a
bracket<00:02:47.260> for<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.739> turbo<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.870> still<00:02:50.140> have

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
bracket for the turbo and we still have

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.120 
bracket for the turbo and we still have
to<00:02:50.560> find<00:02:51.000> air<00:02:52.000> filter<00:02:52.390> for<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.920> that's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
to find air filter for it but that's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.830 
to find air filter for it but that's
pretty<00:02:54.400> much<00:02:54.549> all<00:02:54.910> I've<00:02:55.090> got<00:02:55.299> for<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.569> right

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
pretty much all I've got for you right

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.230 
pretty much all I've got for you right
now<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:58.180> back<00:02:58.360> with<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.690> as<00:02:58.780> soon<00:02:58.900> as<00:02:59.079> I<00:02:59.170> can
