simple<00:00:21.420> setup<00:00:21.869> here's<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> DC<00:00:23.070> power<00:00:23.310> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
simple setup here's the DC power that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.630 
simple setup here's the DC power that
comes<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.680> plugs<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> wall

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
comes in plugs in right into the wall
outlet<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.810> sends<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> power<00:00:28.680> back

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
outlet and it sends all the power back

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.280 
outlet and it sends all the power back
into<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.519> grid<00:00:32.120> right<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.540> not<00:00:33.660> sending

heater<00:02:35.330> project<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.990> I'm<00:02:36.080> working<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.590> was

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
heater project that I'm working on I was

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
heater project that I'm working on I was
just<00:02:36.980> testing<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.520> see<00:02:37.610> how<00:02:37.790> hot<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.270> water

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
just testing it to see how hot the water

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.740 
just testing it to see how hot the water
comes<00:02:38.750> out<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:40.000> Andy<00:02:41.000> was<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.510> this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
comes out and Andy was just like this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.480 
comes out and Andy was just like this
just<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.170> black<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.770> on<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> ground<00:02:43.190> it's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
just a black to there on the ground it's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.820 
just a black to there on the ground it's
still<00:02:44.210> well<00:02:44.630> water<00:02:44.870> came<00:02:45.140> out<00:02:45.320> still<00:02:45.560> pretty

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
still well water came out still pretty

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.700 
still well water came out still pretty
hot<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.690> mean<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.810> was<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.080> was<00:02:48.170> enough<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.530> burn

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
hot I mean it was it was enough to burn

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.410 
hot I mean it was it was enough to burn
my<00:02:48.890> hand<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.400> poured<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.760> into<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.150> bucket

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
my hand I poured it into this bucket

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.950 
my hand I poured it into this bucket
here<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.020> was<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.680> was<00:02:51.800> pretty<00:02:52.160> darn<00:02:52.430> hot

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
here and it was it was pretty darn hot

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.620 
here and it was it was pretty darn hot
so<00:02:53.960> I<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.830> just<00:02:54.860> imagine<00:02:55.100> when<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.610> was<00:02:56.510> going

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
so I can just imagine when it was going

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.390 
so I can just imagine when it was going
to<00:02:56.750> come<00:02:56.930> out<00:02:56.960> once<00:02:57.260> i<00:02:57.380> make<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.560> box<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.100> seal

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
to come out once i make a box and seal

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.350 
to come out once i make a box and seal
it<00:02:58.430> up<00:02:58.640> real<00:02:58.880> tight<00:02:59.350> but<00:03:00.910> i'm<00:03:01.910> going<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.150> start

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
it up real tight but i'm going to start

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.020 
it up real tight but i'm going to start
at<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:02.900> i<00:03:03.080> saw<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.770> lady<00:03:04.160> i<00:03:04.340> work<00:03:04.430> was

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
at this because i saw a lady i work was

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.570 
at this because i saw a lady i work was
asking<00:03:05.450> me<00:03:05.600> about<00:03:05.680> solar<00:03:06.680> hot<00:03:06.980> water<00:03:07.040> heater

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
asking me about solar hot water heater

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.790 
asking me about solar hot water heater
so<00:03:07.850> i<00:03:07.880> decided<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.390> go<00:03:08.570> ahead<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.960> test<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.440> I

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
so i decided to go ahead and test it I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.860 
so i decided to go ahead and test it I
don't<00:03:10.580> think<00:03:10.640> it'll<00:03:10.880> maybe<00:03:11.060> building<00:03:11.540> two<00:03:11.750> of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
don't think it'll maybe building two of

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.580 
don't think it'll maybe building two of
these<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.440> hooking<00:03:13.190> them<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.520> together<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
these and hooking them up together and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.820 
these and hooking them up together and
maybe<00:03:15.850> building<00:03:16.850> her<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> little<00:03:17.560> solar<00:03:18.560> hot

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
maybe building her a little solar hot

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.920 
maybe building her a little solar hot
water<00:03:18.890> heater<00:03:19.490> she<00:03:19.790> probably<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.420> hooked<00:03:20.780> up

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
water heater she probably just hooked up

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.130 
water heater she probably just hooked up
right<00:03:21.110> into<00:03:21.380> her<00:03:22.030> water<00:03:23.030> filtration<00:03:23.480> system

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
right into her water filtration system

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
right into her water filtration system
and<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.580> or<00:03:25.730> pulled<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.240> the<00:03:26.330> day<00:03:27.130> but<00:03:28.130> uh

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
and it up or pulled on the day but uh

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.730 
and it up or pulled on the day but uh
anyway<00:03:28.820> that's<00:03:29.240> pretty<00:03:29.480> much<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.690> if<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.530> want

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
anyway that's pretty much it if you want

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.280 
anyway that's pretty much it if you want
to<00:03:30.860> any<00:03:31.790> information<00:03:32.090> on<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.660> little<00:03:32.930> power

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
to any information on that little power

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.430 
to any information on that little power
inverter<00:03:33.740> it's<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.010> grid-tied<00:03:34.280> power<00:03:34.730> inverter

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
inverter it's a grid-tied power inverter

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.380 
inverter it's a grid-tied power inverter
so<00:03:36.440> if<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.800> pack<00:03:37.250> feeds<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.700> power<00:03:37.970> into<00:03:38.300> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
so if this pack feeds the power into the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.920 
so if this pack feeds the power into the
house<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:40.430> I<00:03:40.550> said<00:03:40.610> with<00:03:40.910> these<00:03:41.090> panels<00:03:41.570> here

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
house like I said with these panels here

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.410 
house like I said with these panels here
it<00:03:42.110> really<00:03:42.260> isn't<00:03:42.770> really<00:03:43.430> doesn't<00:03:43.760> feedback

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
it really isn't really doesn't feedback

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.650 
it really isn't really doesn't feedback
that<00:03:44.690> much<00:03:44.900> powering<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.739> little<00:03:46.390> gauge<00:03:47.390> that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
that much powering the little gauge that

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.990 
that much powering the little gauge that
I<00:03:47.750> had<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.020> was<00:03:48.440> showing<00:03:48.770> like<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> point<00:03:49.700> zero

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
I had that was showing like a point zero

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.720 
I had that was showing like a point zero
one<00:03:50.090> amp<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.200> these<00:03:51.709> supposedly<00:03:52.459> are

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
one amp it and these supposedly are

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.660 
one amp it and these supposedly are
rated<00:03:53.060> at<00:03:53.209> three<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.340> don't<00:03:55.340> know<00:03:55.430> it's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
rated at three but I don't know it's

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.540 
rated at three but I don't know it's
just<00:03:55.850> not<00:03:56.480> giving<00:03:56.750> out<00:03:56.840> with<00:03:57.550> the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
just not giving out with the

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.960 
just not giving out with the
manufacturing<00:03:59.330> said<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.580> anyway<00:04:01.580> if<00:04:01.880> you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
manufacturing said but anyway if you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.699 
manufacturing said but anyway if you

have any questions or comments about

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.300 
have any questions or comments about
this<00:04:03.920> setup<00:04:04.340> or<00:04:04.610> anything<00:04:05.000> let<00:04:05.150> me<00:04:05.180> know
