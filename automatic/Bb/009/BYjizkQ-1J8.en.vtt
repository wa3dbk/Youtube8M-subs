00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello youtube friends welcome to a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.839
 new tutorial of kano varieties in 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.219
 this time we are going to teach you how 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.870
 unlock the lg optimus the 5 dual sim 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 for when we introduce the pattern of 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.119
 unlocking several times incorrect but 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.990
 so for this to start we have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.990
 what to turn off the cell 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.270
 we wait for it to turn off completely 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.690
 well it's already turned off then for 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.640
 turn it on to follow hard reset let's go 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.129
 to turn it on by pressing the key 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.470
 on and the low volume key and 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.210
 when the touch buttons turn on 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.470
 we release the buttons and leave 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.470
 press the home key 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 well here we are already breathing 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.799
 when the phone turns on we're going to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.780
 get as I factory will not have the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.670
 unlock pattern yes I think it's going 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.580
 to give the option to introduce a new 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.420
 Pattern 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.420
 but in stories 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.390
 here it is restarting 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.399
 as you can see it turns on normally 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.229
 and we remove the micro sd for 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 avoid that suddenly I can think of some 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.310
 information that we have there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.440
 it takes a little while to turn on 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.780
 so that it is already lighting 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.000
 increases the configuration that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.000
 We usually do when we buy it 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.250
 you configure it to your liking 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.830
 and as you can see here already in the sense of 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.830
 phone completely 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.110
 here he is charging us and icons 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.520
 and already they have to see when 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.890
 they bought 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.750
 with good factory configuration 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.030
 friends this is all I hope you have
