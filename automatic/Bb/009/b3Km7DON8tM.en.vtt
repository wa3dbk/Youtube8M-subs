Bram Stoker's Dracula for the NES is

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.879 
Bram Stoker's Dracula for the NES is
such<00:00:11.270> a<00:00:11.300> cheap<00:00:11.630> piece<00:00:11.900> of<00:00:12.080> shit<00:00:12.350> that<00:00:12.380> I<00:00:12.590> had<00:00:12.740> no

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889

idea<00:00:13.190> how<00:00:13.370> to<00:00:13.430> review<00:00:13.760> it<00:00:13.940> first<00:00:14.389> I<00:00:14.570> considered

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
idea how to review it first I considered

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.330 
idea how to review it first I considered
reviewing<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:15.500> whole<00:00:15.650> game<00:00:15.920> but<00:00:16.189> then<00:00:16.279> I

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
reviewing the whole game but then I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.620 
reviewing the whole game but then I
decided<00:00:16.700> against<00:00:17.090> it<00:00:17.150> because<00:00:17.270> I<00:00:17.390> couldn't

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
decided against it because I couldn't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.089 
decided against it because I couldn't
fucking<00:00:17.810> stand<00:00:18.170> playing<00:00:18.410> it<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.619> first<00:00:18.860> time

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
fucking stand playing it the first time

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.890 
fucking stand playing it the first time
through<00:00:19.369> then<00:00:19.790> I<00:00:19.880> considered<00:00:20.330> doing<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.660> stupid

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
through then I considered doing a stupid

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.960 
through then I considered doing a stupid
boss<00:00:21.290> battle<00:00:21.710> segment<00:00:21.980> because<00:00:22.250> Christ<00:00:22.730> knows

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
boss battle segment because Christ knows

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.060 
boss battle segment because Christ knows
his<00:00:23.180> stinky<00:00:23.599> yeast<00:00:23.840> infected<00:00:24.380> twat<00:00:24.649> if<00:00:24.770> a<00:00:24.860> game

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
his stinky yeast infected twat if a game

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.769 
his stinky yeast infected twat if a game
has<00:00:25.099> enough<00:00:25.520> of<00:00:25.669> them<00:00:25.759> unfortunately<00:00:26.360> half

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
has enough of them unfortunately half

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.510 
has enough of them unfortunately half
the<00:00:26.930> boss<00:00:27.140> battles<00:00:27.619> are<00:00:27.739> the<00:00:27.860> same<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:28.310> it'd<00:00:28.430> be

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
the boss battles are the same so it'd be

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.159 
the boss battles are the same so it'd be
Verdun<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:28.910> pointless<00:00:29.450> to<00:00:29.570> cover<00:00:29.779> them<00:00:29.989> so

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
Verdun and pointless to cover them so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.019 
Verdun and pointless to cover them so
finally<00:00:30.739> I<00:00:30.770> decided<00:00:31.160> on<00:00:31.279> a<00:00:31.340> levels<00:00:31.700> from<00:00:31.820> Hell

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
finally I decided on a levels from Hell

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.940 
finally I decided on a levels from Hell
segments<00:00:32.540> than<00:00:32.630> I<00:00:32.689> thought<00:00:32.840> which<00:00:33.050> level<00:00:33.500> if<00:00:33.800> I

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
segments than I thought which level if I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.440 
segments than I thought which level if I
tried<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> levels<00:00:34.760> from<00:00:34.880> hell<00:00:35.059> same<00:00:35.300> and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
tried to do a levels from hell same and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.549 
tried to do a levels from hell same and
I<00:00:35.480> probably<00:00:35.600> end<00:00:35.809> up<00:00:35.840> with<00:00:35.960> twenty<00:00:36.230> or<00:00:36.350> thirty

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
I probably end up with twenty or thirty

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:37.810 
I probably end up with twenty or thirty
segments<00:00:37.040> because<00:00:37.190> I'd<00:00:37.280> have<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:37.430> cover<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
segments because I'd have to cover the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.610 
segments because I'd have to cover the
whole<00:00:37.969> fucking<00:00:38.360> game<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.110> then<00:00:39.230> finally<00:00:39.559> I

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
whole fucking game but then finally I

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.470 
whole fucking game but then finally I
thought<00:00:39.860> okay<00:00:40.399> when<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.580> do<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.910> last<00:00:41.090> level

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
thought okay when I do the last level

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.430 
thought okay when I do the last level
because<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:41.900> seems<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.170> epitomize

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
because that seems to epitomize

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.930 
because that seems to epitomize
everything<00:00:42.710> that's<00:00:43.310> wrong<00:00:43.460> with<00:00:43.520> this<00:00:43.730> game

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
everything that's wrong with this game

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.760 
everything that's wrong with this game
so<00:00:44.150> think<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:44.930> review<00:00:45.230> as<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> combination

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
so think of this review as a combination

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.830 
so think of this review as a combination
levels<00:00:46.430> from<00:00:46.520> how<00:00:46.730> I'm<00:00:46.880> stupid<00:00:47.270> boss<00:00:47.450> battle

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
levels from how I'm stupid boss battle

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.810

or if you rolled into one anyway let's
get<00:00:49.970> into<00:00:50.240> it<00:00:50.270> levels<00:00:50.900> from<00:00:51.050> how<00:00:51.200> Brahm

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
get into it levels from how Brahm

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.680 
get into it levels from how Brahm

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
level designs now this would be

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700

excusable<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.690> this<00:01:06.840> game<00:01:07.020> where<00:01:07.200> Super<00:01:07.500> Mario

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
excusable of this game where Super Mario

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
excusable of this game where Super Mario
Brothers<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.190> it<00:01:08.250> came<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> 1985<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:09.810> it

you may as well just shut the game off
right<00:05:37.620> now<00:05:37.770> because<00:05:37.950> you're<00:05:38.190> not<00:05:38.220> going<00:05:38.460> to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.470 
could not beat him after a few tries hey
maybe<00:05:49.770> that's<00:05:50.010> why<00:05:50.190> Psygnosis<00:05:50.820> hit<00:05:50.970> Dracula

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480

maybe that's why Psygnosis hit Dracula
maybe<00:05:51.870> they<00:05:52.050> thought<00:05:52.170> if<00:05:52.350> no<00:05:52.470> one<00:05:52.590> could<00:05:52.680> ever

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
maybe they thought if no one could ever

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.290 
maybe they thought if no one could ever
find<00:05:52.920> him<00:05:53.310> then<00:05:53.460> no<00:05:53.490> one<00:05:53.700> would<00:05:53.820> realize<00:05:53.970> what
