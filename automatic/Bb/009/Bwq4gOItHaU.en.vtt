the symbols and then do the winning
numbers<00:02:36.150> end<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:37.290> going<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.500> do<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.920> one

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
numbers end so I'm going to do one one

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.380 
numbers end so I'm going to do one one
way<00:02:38.459> one<00:02:38.670> another<00:02:38.970> way<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.680> own<00:02:40.830> benefit

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
way one another way just my own benefit

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.759 
way one another way just my own benefit
so<00:02:42.390> we've<00:02:42.780> got<00:02:44.090> 22<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:47.120> 27<00:02:49.010> 23<00:02:50.510> 29<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.440> 20s

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
so we've got 22 to 27 23 29 all the 20s

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.289 
so we've got 22 to 27 23 29 all the 20s
probably<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:55.200> that's<00:02:55.350> not<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> winner<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:57.150> not
