gonna make ten million dollars on I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.980 
gonna make ten million dollars on I
think<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.310> dumb<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.390> Dumberer<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:17.780> dumb

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
think it was dumb and Dumberer be dumb

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.370 
think it was dumb and Dumberer be dumb
and<00:02:18.140> dumber

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and dumber

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.590 
and dumber
yeah<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.580> visualize<00:02:20.180> yourself<00:02:20.450> like

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
yeah so you visualize yourself like

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.340 
yeah so you visualize yourself like
visualization<00:02:23.600> works<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.140> work<00:02:24.319> hard

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
visualization works if you work hard

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.630 
visualization works if you work hard
yeah

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
yeah

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.400 
yeah
well<00:02:25.730> yeah<00:02:25.910> that's<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.930> just

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
well yeah that's that I think just

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.470 
well yeah that's that I think just
visualizing<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.790> know<00:02:28.910> go<00:02:29.270> eat<00:02:29.390> a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
visualizing and you know go eat a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.820 
visualizing and you know go eat a
sandwich<00:02:29.770> I<00:02:31.510> love<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.170> was<00:02:33.319> such<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
sandwich I love that that was such a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.360 
sandwich I love that that was such a
powerful<00:02:34.459> moment<00:02:35.120> for<00:02:35.150> me<00:02:35.450> because<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:36.250> was<00:02:37.250> not

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
powerful moment for me because I was not

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.390 
powerful moment for me because I was not
a<00:02:37.430> person<00:02:37.670> who<00:02:37.940> did<00:02:38.150> visualization<00:02:38.990> or

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
a person who did visualization or

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.070 
a person who did visualization or
thought<00:02:40.400> about<00:02:40.790> my<00:02:41.780> belief<00:02:42.290> system<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:44.050> such<00:02:45.050> a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
thought about my belief system in such a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.860 
thought about my belief system in such a
practical<00:02:45.709> way<00:02:46.010> but<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.209> learned<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.660> lot<00:02:47.810> from

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
practical way but I learned a lot from

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.900 
practical way but I learned a lot from

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
believe it it is a lot easier to achieve

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.350 
believe it it is a lot easier to achieve

do that process

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.199 
do that process
live<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.260> space<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:13.000> wanting<00:03:14.000> and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
resisting it instead of writing it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.920 
resisting it instead of writing it
visualizing<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.459> seeing<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.269> for<00:03:20.510> yourself

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
visualizing it seeing it for yourself

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.340 
visualizing it seeing it for yourself
and<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:21.560> letting<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.100> go
