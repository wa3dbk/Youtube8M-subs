what it is is it's the highly resin wood
inside<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.580> pine<00:00:57.850> tree<00:00:58.210> or<00:00:58.239> most<00:00:58.600> trees<00:00:58.870> of

that nature if you look right here we

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.840 
that nature if you look right here we
can<00:01:03.940> see<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.330> different<00:01:04.720> color<00:01:05.520> this<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.729> all

white

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.480 

but<00:01:13.219> here<00:01:13.460> it's<00:01:13.610> not<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:14.259> dark<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:16.159> almost

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
but here it's not very dark it's almost

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.200 
but here it's not very dark it's almost
ready<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.210> that's<00:01:18.200> heavily<00:01:18.590> resonant<00:01:19.369> okay

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
ready and that's heavily resonant okay

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.510

resin and that's where the resin

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.850 
resin and that's where the resin
collects<00:01:24.909> it's<00:01:25.909> in<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.179> heart<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> tree

it's at a stump or a branch intersection
like<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:31.970> for<00:01:32.390> this<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.700> when<00:01:34.700> trees<00:01:34.970> have

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
like this for this and when trees have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.710 
like this for this and when trees have
fallen<00:01:35.210> over<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.369> get<00:01:38.179> up<00:01:38.299> here<00:01:38.450> at<00:01:38.569> these

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
fallen over you can get up here at these

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.410 
fallen over you can get up here at these
branch<00:01:39.020> intersections<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.939> we<00:01:41.179> take<00:01:41.360> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
branch intersections and if we take a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:53.180 
branch intersections and if we take a
look<00:01:44.560> right<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.740> here

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.890 
rule of thumb because whatever you think
you<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.060> not<00:03:03.209> enough<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> get<00:03:03.750> through

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
you have it's not enough to get through

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.530 
you have it's not enough to get through
the<00:03:03.989> whole<00:03:04.110> night<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.580> gather<00:03:05.580> as<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:06.209> as<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the whole night so gather as much as you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.910 
the whole night so gather as much as you
think<00:03:06.720> you'll<00:03:06.930> need<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.320> they<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.709> five

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
think you'll need and they get five

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.800 
think you'll need and they get five
times<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.459> much<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.300> anyway<00:03:09.510> we're<00:03:09.750> gonna

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
times that much but anyway we're gonna

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.000 
times that much but anyway we're gonna
come<00:03:10.020> right<00:03:10.170> back<00:03:10.320> I'm<00:03:10.500> gonna<00:03:10.590> feather<00:03:10.830> these

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
come right back I'm gonna feather these

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.430 
come right back I'm gonna feather these
up<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.370> show<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.550> how<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:11.820> burn<00:03:12.380> now<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
up and show you how they burn now you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.440 
up and show you how they burn now you
can<00:03:13.620> also<00:03:13.770> find<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:16.320> wood<00:03:16.560> at<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.730> bottom<00:03:18.209> of

intersections<00:03:24.360> like<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.720> said<00:03:24.989> now<00:03:25.560> all<00:03:25.709> I've

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
intersections like I said now all I've

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.009 
intersections like I said now all I've
done<00:03:26.100> with<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.269> just<00:03:27.480> feathered<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
done with this is it just feathered it

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.400 
done with this is it just feathered it
just<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.380> little<00:03:28.760> not<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> whole<00:03:30.090> lot<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.630> I'm

just a little not a whole lot and I'm
just<00:03:31.560> gonna<00:03:31.709> hit<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.160> some<00:03:32.340> flame<00:03:32.610> and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
just gonna hit it with some flame and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.370 
just gonna hit it with some flame and
I'll<00:03:34.050> show<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> mean<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.870> takes<00:03:37.140> right

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
I'll show you what I mean it takes right

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.000 
I'll show you what I mean it takes right

you can see that thick black smoke

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.619 
you can see that thick black smoke
coming<00:03:43.840> off<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.170> it

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.449 

and<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:52.010> resin<00:03:52.370> burning<00:03:54.280> now<00:03:55.280> that

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
and that's the resin burning now that

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.599 
and that's the resin burning now that
has<00:03:55.760> a<00:03:55.790> whole<00:03:55.969> lot<00:03:55.999> more<00:03:56.359> resin<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:58.069> in

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
has a whole lot more resin in it and in

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.420 
has a whole lot more resin in it and in
just<00:03:58.879> that<00:03:59.030> little<00:03:59.540> touch<00:03:59.810> with<00:04:00.430> that

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
just that little touch with that

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.580 
just that little touch with that
cigarette<00:04:01.909> lighter<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.420> there<00:04:03.019> we<00:04:03.139> go<00:04:03.319> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
cigarette lighter and there we go and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.729 
cigarette lighter and there we go and
this<00:04:04.249> stuff<00:04:04.459> will<00:04:04.579> take<00:04:04.639> a<00:04:04.819> spark<00:04:05.299> off<00:04:05.540> a

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
this stuff will take a spark off a

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.670 
this stuff will take a spark off a
ferrocerium<00:04:06.739> rod<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.810> will<00:04:09.019> burn<00:04:09.319> and

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
ferrocerium rod and it will burn and

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.300 
ferrocerium rod and it will burn and
burn<00:04:09.859> profusely<00:04:10.549> for<00:04:10.849> quite<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.209> while<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.310> you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
burn profusely for quite a while and you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.009 
burn profusely for quite a while and you
can<00:04:13.340> just<00:04:13.609> cut<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.939> up<00:04:14.180> into<00:04:14.359> slippers<00:04:14.840> or

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
can just cut this up into slippers or

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.740 
can just cut this up into slippers or
make<00:04:15.139> feather<00:04:15.409> sticks<00:04:15.799> out<00:04:16.009> of<00:04:16.039> it<00:04:16.509> and<00:04:17.509> it

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
make feather sticks out of it and it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.569 
make feather sticks out of it and it
will<00:04:17.930> it'll<00:04:18.470> get<00:04:18.650> your<00:04:18.829> fire<00:04:19.039> going<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.489> a

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
will it'll get your fire going in a

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.060 
will it'll get your fire going in a
pinch<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.239> it'll<00:04:20.570> burn<00:04:20.690> wet<00:04:21.079> or<00:04:21.199> dry<00:04:21.349> because

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
pinch and it'll burn wet or dry because

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.920 
pinch and it'll burn wet or dry because
it's<00:04:22.430> got<00:04:22.580> all<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.880> resin<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.690> can

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
it's got all that resin in it you can

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.629 
it's got all that resin in it you can
get<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.229> wet<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:25.130> will<00:04:25.250> still<00:04:25.520> burn<00:04:26.080> so

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
get it wet and it will still burn so

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.070 
get it wet and it will still burn so
it's<00:04:28.639> something<00:04:29.060> good<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.389> carry<00:04:29.570> around<00:04:29.750> with

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
it's something good to carry around with

birch barks great anything that has
resins<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.199> it<00:04:39.289> but<00:04:39.470> that's<00:04:39.590> how<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.889> get<00:04:40.160> fat

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
resins in it but that's how you get fat

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.219 
resins in it but that's how you get fat
wood<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:40.849> that's<00:04:40.940> how<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> can<00:04:41.539> utilize<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
wood and that's how you can utilize it

baton that four or five times you know
to<00:04:51.680> split<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.370> up<00:04:52.520> that<00:04:53.270> would<00:04:53.389> be<00:04:53.449> great

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
to split it up that would be great

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.689 
to split it up that would be great
