the numbers are always the quarter notes
the<00:01:09.720> numbers<00:01:10.049> correspond<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.040> tapping

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the numbers correspond to you tapping

foot<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.520> that's<00:01:14.670> unfortunate<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
foot and that's unfortunate because it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.480 
foot and that's unfortunate because it's
pretty<00:01:16.380> important<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.310> foot

pretty important you get your foot

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
pretty important you get your foot
tapping<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.200> getting<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.260> little<00:01:19.380> kinesthetic

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tapping and getting a little kinesthetic

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.500 
tapping and getting a little kinesthetic
in<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.340> moving<00:01:20.760> along<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> groove

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
in this moving along with the groove

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.030 
in this moving along with the groove
helps<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> stay<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.350> groove<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.650> special

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
helps you stay in the groove is special

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
helps you stay in the groove is special
when<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.430> into<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> more

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
when we get into some of the more

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.280 
when we get into some of the more
advanced<00:01:24.420> rhythms<00:01:24.720> where<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.080> playing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
advanced rhythms where you're playing

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.370 
advanced rhythms where you're playing
across<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> bar<00:01:26.010> line<00:01:26.250> things<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.700> that

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
across the bar line things like that

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.679 
across the bar line things like that
well<00:01:28.380> let's<00:01:28.650> test<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:30.360> back<00:01:30.570> to

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
well let's test this if you go back to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.510 
well let's test this if you go back to
some<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.049> other<00:01:31.260> jam<00:01:31.560> tracks<00:01:31.950> let's<00:01:32.310> go

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
some of these other jam tracks let's go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
some of these other jam tracks let's go
to<00:01:32.580> one<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> our<00:01:33.330> shuffles<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> again<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> said

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to one of our shuffles and again I said

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
to one of our shuffles and again I said
they<00:01:34.860> come<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.159> various<00:01:35.490> tempos<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
they come in various tempos here so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.410 
they come in various tempos here so
let's<00:01:36.780> listen<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:40.759> before<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.119> play

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
let's listen to this one before you play

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
let's listen to this one before you play
anything<00:01:42.689> make<00:01:42.990> sure<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.500> count<00:01:43.909> 1<00:01:44.909> 2<00:01:45.600> 3<00:01:46.070> 4

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
anything make sure you can count 1 2 3 4

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
anything make sure you can count 1 2 3 4
just<00:01:47.460> practically<00:01:48.829> okay

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.750 

now<00:01:53.110> what<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.530> group<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.010> lessons<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.520> doing

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
now what this group of lessons is doing

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.550 
now what this group of lessons is doing
is<00:01:54.850> providing<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.390> foundation<00:01:55.750> upon<00:01:56.500> which

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
is providing a foundation upon which

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.830 
is providing a foundation upon which
we're<00:01:56.890> gonna<00:01:56.950> develop<00:01:57.640> rhythm<00:01:58.150> parts<00:01:58.600> and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
we're gonna develop rhythm parts and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.450 
we're gonna develop rhythm parts and
lead<00:01:59.050> parts<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.620> all<00:01:59.680> kinds<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.980> things<00:02:00.040> so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
lead parts and all kinds of things so

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.460 
lead parts and all kinds of things so
it's<00:02:00.580> gonna<00:02:00.700> be<00:02:00.850> very<00:02:01.150> elementary<00:02:01.840> if<00:02:02.230> you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
it's gonna be very elementary if you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's gonna be very elementary if you
already<00:02:02.560> know<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:02.980> you<00:02:03.250> can<00:02:03.370> go<00:02:03.430> ahead<00:02:03.490> and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
already know this you can go ahead and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.150 
already know this you can go ahead and
bypass<00:02:03.730> and<00:02:04.090> go<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.360> next<00:02:04.660> lessons<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.710> if

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
bypass and go to the next lessons but if

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.740 
bypass and go to the next lessons but if
you're<00:02:06.730> just<00:02:06.880> practicing<00:02:07.060> playing<00:02:07.390> against

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
you're just practicing playing against

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.359 
you're just practicing playing against
this<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.170> see<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.500> have<00:02:08.770> your<00:02:08.920> E<00:02:09.130> minor

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
this you see you have your E minor

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.910 
this you see you have your E minor
pentatonic<00:02:09.729> all<00:02:10.149> diagrammed<00:02:10.720> both<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.530> open

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
pentatonic all diagrammed both in open

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.010 
pentatonic all diagrammed both in open
and<00:02:12.040> 12th<00:02:12.370> position<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.660> entire

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and 12th position and in the entire

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.080 
and 12th position and in the entire
fingerboard<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.130> if<00:02:15.280> i<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.430> practice

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
fingerboard so if i just practice

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.490 
fingerboard so if i just practice
playing<00:02:16.330> licks<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.990> don't<00:02:17.170> worry<00:02:17.410> about

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
playing licks and don't worry about

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.140 
playing licks and don't worry about
being<00:02:17.950> able<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> play<00:02:18.340> exactly<00:02:18.520> what<00:02:19.030> i'm

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
being able to play exactly what i'm

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.210 
being able to play exactly what i'm
playing<00:02:19.480> we'll<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.170> point<00:02:20.350> but<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.070> i

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
playing we'll get to that point but if i

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.040 
playing we'll get to that point but if i
just<00:02:21.250> start<00:02:21.820> off<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.240> say<00:02:22.300> well<00:02:22.450> i<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.780> want

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
just start off and say well i just want

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.540 
just start off and say well i just want
to<00:02:23.080> make<00:02:23.230> sure<00:02:23.290> i<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.740> stay<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.190> pocket

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
to make sure i can stay in the pocket

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:42.120 
to make sure i can stay in the pocket
and<00:02:24.640> play<00:02:24.850> just<00:02:24.880> quarter<00:02:25.450> notes<00:02:25.860> 2<00:02:26.860> 3<00:02:33.540> i<00:02:41.130> am

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and play just quarter notes 2 3 i am

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.830 
and play just quarter notes 2 3 i am
just<00:02:42.459> playing<00:02:42.550> on<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> quarter<00:02:43.360> notes<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.750> it

just playing on the quarter notes and it

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.570 
just playing on the quarter notes and it
files<00:02:44.020> down<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.470> old<00:02:44.620> position<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.430> it's

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
files down the old position but it's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.970 
files down the old position but it's
kind<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.940> limiting<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.590> kind<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.650> square

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
kind of limiting it's kind of square

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.470 
kind of limiting it's kind of square
because<00:02:54.430> you're<00:02:54.580> not<00:02:54.700> playing<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.120> any<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
because you're not playing on any of the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.420 
because you're not playing on any of the
offbeat's<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.350> you're<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.799> subdividing<00:02:57.400> the

that you just practice playing in the E
minor<00:03:10.060> pentatonic<00:03:10.180> scale<00:03:10.930> now<00:03:11.410> I've<00:03:11.560> set<00:03:11.799> this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
minor pentatonic scale now I've set this

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.140 
minor pentatonic scale now I've set this
up<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> where<00:03:12.430> if<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.610> were<00:03:12.700> an<00:03:12.790> absolute

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
up to where if you were an absolute

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.550 
up to where if you were an absolute
beginner<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> wanted<00:03:14.019> to<00:03:14.049> get<00:03:14.170> into<00:03:14.320> some

beginner and you wanted to get into some
dabble<00:03:14.890> into<00:03:15.010> some<00:03:15.190> lead<00:03:15.370> playing<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.820> could

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
dabble into some lead playing you could

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.910 
dabble into some lead playing you could
use<00:03:16.299> those<00:03:16.540> minor<00:03:16.930> diagram<00:03:17.470> C<00:03:17.739> minor

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
use those minor diagram C minor

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.100 
use those minor diagram C minor
pentatonic<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.640> just<00:03:19.120> play<00:03:19.330> some<00:03:19.600> notes<00:03:19.750> but

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
pentatonic and just play some notes but

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.300 
pentatonic and just play some notes but
if<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.709> don't<00:03:20.890> know<00:03:21.010> where<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.280> are

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
if you don't know where you are

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.250 
if you don't know where you are
rhythmically<00:03:22.000> you're<00:03:22.540> never<00:03:22.750> gonna<00:03:22.930> sound

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
rhythmically you're never gonna sound

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.170 
rhythmically you're never gonna sound
like<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.980> creative<00:03:24.459> player<00:03:24.700> you're<00:03:24.940> gonna<00:03:25.060> be

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
like a creative player you're gonna be

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.729 
like a creative player you're gonna be
very<00:03:25.360> limited<00:03:25.720> because<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:26.049> scale<00:03:26.320> only<00:03:26.470> has

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
very limited because that scale only has

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.620 
very limited because that scale only has
five<00:03:26.980> notes<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.790> important<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.360> address

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
five notes it's important you address

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.080 
five notes it's important you address
this<00:03:28.810> rhythm<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.350> if<00:03:29.830> you're<00:03:29.950> playing<00:03:30.220> rhythm

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
this rhythm and if you're playing rhythm

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
this rhythm and if you're playing rhythm
guitar<00:03:31.120> against<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.930> let's<00:03:32.200> just<00:03:32.290> say<00:03:32.530> we're

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
guitar against this let's just say we're

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.039 
guitar against this let's just say we're
playing<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:33.100> East<00:03:34.650> 77th<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:36.750> rhythm<00:03:37.750> guitar

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
playing in East 77th a rhythm guitar

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.479 
playing in East 77th a rhythm guitar
part<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.500> would<00:03:38.590> involve<00:03:38.799> just<00:03:39.070> core<00:03:39.280> notes

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
part that would involve just core notes

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:51.720 
part that would involve just core notes
would<00:03:39.670> sound<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.030> this

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.750 

first<00:03:52.730> time<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.000> play<00:03:53.180> staccato<00:03:53.450> one<00:03:54.760> three

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
first time I play staccato one three

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.700 
first time I play staccato one three
four<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.780> then<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.960> second<00:03:57.260> time<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.470> let<00:03:57.620> them

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
four and then the second time I let them

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.870 
four and then the second time I let them
ring<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:01.070> there<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.430> quick<00:04:01.730> overview

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
ring so there you have a quick overview

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.790 
ring so there you have a quick overview
of<00:04:02.300> how<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:02.600> could<00:04:02.780> approach<00:04:03.080> quarter<00:04:03.590> notes

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
of how you could approach quarter notes

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.360 
of how you could approach quarter notes
against<00:04:04.700> these<00:04:05.030> grooves
