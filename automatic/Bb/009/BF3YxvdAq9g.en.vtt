00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.919
 new race track 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.910
 today we are with susanna ingelheim and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 make the race track of jana home 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.949
 even because she's here alone 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.199
 horse racing here is now first 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.330
 you have to work a bit up there 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.760
 watch a banner that lies a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 a little stupid behind the bush there can 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 you do not abbreviate too much now you see 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 Here I am as usual 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.420
 happened that I have provided 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 Ride outside I am here to hold 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.059
 We left us tight because he was one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.399
 a bit left-heavy because leave here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.090
 he jumps out of the first tree trunk and jumps 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 the second 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 we do not jump over it at all 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 easily misled in the middle by 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.039
 kept and left her now very sharp 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.500
 then I jump each obstacle 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 Here we cut a little bit over it 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 Ride no great at all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.450
 keeping curves clean is virtually too tight 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.170
 somehow the ideal line goes here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170
 jump over it 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.369
 as well as here already have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 almost made it to the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.659
 zielgerade 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.720
 I saddled again on the day of war 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.950
 maybe even level 7 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.220
 so here we are now on here 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.220
 devices 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 Zack and that was already the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 actual points where you are a bit 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.770
 saving time can actually be 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.329
 behind uphill passage where the s-curve 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.350
 built but this tight left turn 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.720
 when you get back on the way 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.250
 I hope I could get you there 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.259
 some useful tips with the way 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.360
 give and see you friday 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.360
 next race until then you love
