about<00:00:39.940> what<00:00:40.300> player<00:00:40.660> fits<00:00:40.989> best<00:00:41.230> with<00:00:41.350> what

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
about what player fits best with what

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.590 
about what player fits best with what
team<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:42.400> look<00:00:42.550> at<00:00:42.640> last<00:00:42.850> year's<00:00:43.120> draft<00:00:43.330> matt

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
team you look at last year's draft matt

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.210 
team you look at last year's draft matt
leinart<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:44.230> everybody<00:00:44.649> was<00:00:44.829> talking<00:00:45.010> about

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
leinart and everybody was talking about

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.340 
leinart and everybody was talking about
him<00:00:45.489> going<00:00:45.730> number<00:00:46.120> one<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:46.540> he<00:00:46.989> went<00:00:47.200> number

him going number one and he went number

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.770 
him going number one and he went number
ten<00:00:47.680> so<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.310> think<00:00:48.430> Brady<00:00:48.880> coin<00:00:49.180> is<00:00:49.300> actually

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
ten so I think Brady coin is actually

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.880 
ten so I think Brady coin is actually
going<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.020> be<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.140> little<00:00:50.320> late<00:00:50.559> in<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.710> draft

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
going to be a little late in the draft

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.860 
going to be a little late in the draft
but<00:00:51.610> let's<00:00:51.790> look<00:00:51.940> what<00:00:52.149> makes<00:00:52.450> him<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> very

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
but let's look what makes him a very

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.470 
but let's look what makes him a very
valuable<00:00:53.500> player<00:00:53.890> Brady<00:00:54.520> quit<00:00:54.760> probably<00:00:55.300> the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
valuable player Brady quit probably the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.540 
valuable player Brady quit probably the
best<00:00:55.840> characteristic<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.559> he<00:00:56.739> has<00:00:56.950> is<00:00:57.190> he

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
great decision-maker he's very familiar

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.410 
great decision-maker he's very familiar
with<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.930> NFL<00:01:05.379> often<00:01:05.770> speak<00:01:06.009> of<00:01:06.210> Charlie<00:01:07.210> Weis

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
with the NFL often speak of Charlie Weis

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.910 
with the NFL often speak of Charlie Weis
and<00:01:07.750> Charlie<00:01:08.200> Weis<00:01:08.320> used<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.649> be<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
and Charlie Weis used to be the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.560 
and Charlie Weis used to be the
offensive<00:01:09.250> coordinator<00:01:09.550> for<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> Patriots

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
offensive coordinator for the Patriots

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.170 
offensive coordinator for the Patriots
he's<00:01:11.229> also<00:01:11.560> does<00:01:12.130> have<00:01:12.369> some<00:01:12.610> weakness<00:01:12.820> though

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
he's also does have some weakness though

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.120 
he's also does have some weakness though
in<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> pocket<00:01:13.840> presence<00:01:14.050> I<00:01:14.410> think<00:01:14.830> he<00:01:14.920> needs

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
in the pocket presence I think he needs

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.219 
in the pocket presence I think he needs
to<00:01:15.250> work<00:01:15.369> on<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.299> also<00:01:16.479> think<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:16.990> he

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
to work on that and I also think that he

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.930 
to work on that and I also think that he
needs<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.770> with<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> team<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.580> really

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
needs to be with a team that really

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.359 
needs to be with a team that really
gives<00:01:19.390> him<00:01:19.540> good<00:01:19.780> pass<00:01:20.080> protection<00:01:20.560> because<00:01:21.190> I

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
gives him good pass protection because I

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.250 
gives him good pass protection because I
think<00:01:21.670> he<00:01:21.850> has<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.150> tendency<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.690> foursome

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
think he has a tendency to foursome

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.890 
think he has a tendency to foursome
throws<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:24.790> also<00:01:25.030> think<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.510> needs<00:01:25.810> to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
throws and I also think that needs to

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.120 
throws and I also think that needs to
work<00:01:26.049> on<00:01:26.140> his<00:01:26.229> mobile<00:01:26.470> game<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.799> little<00:01:27.010> bit

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
work on his mobile game a little bit

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.070 
work on his mobile game a little bit
he's<00:01:27.549> not<00:01:27.790> as<00:01:28.000> consistent<00:01:28.600> as<00:01:28.659> he<00:01:28.780> should<00:01:29.049> be

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
he's not as consistent as he should be

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.260 
he's not as consistent as he should be
with<00:01:29.290> making<00:01:29.619> plays<00:01:29.799> with<00:01:29.950> his<00:01:30.070> feet<00:01:30.270> but

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
with making plays with his feet but

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.000 
with making plays with his feet but
still<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.990> think<00:01:32.290> that<00:01:32.439> he<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.590> one<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.890> those

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
still I think that he is one of those

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.160 
still I think that he is one of those
players<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.640> with<00:01:33.970> great<00:01:34.180> preparation<00:01:34.990> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
players that with great preparation and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.440 
players that with great preparation and
great<00:01:35.650> coaching<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.580> he<00:01:36.790> really<00:01:37.090> will<00:01:37.270> do

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
great coaching that he really will do

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.940 
great coaching that he really will do
well<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.780> he'll<00:01:37.900> he'll<00:01:38.260> improve<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:38.830> of

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
well and he'll he'll improve on all of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.620 
well and he'll he'll improve on all of
this<00:01:39.040> weaknesses<00:01:39.520> he's<00:01:39.760> very<00:01:39.820> similar<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.330> Tom

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
this weaknesses he's very similar to Tom

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.230 
this weaknesses he's very similar to Tom
great<00:01:40.869> ok<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.680> let's<00:01:41.979> look<00:01:42.130> at<00:01:42.280> this<00:01:42.369> draft<00:01:42.700> you

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
great ok so let's look at this draft you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.550 
great ok so let's look at this draft you
look<00:01:43.420> at<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.570> oakland<00:01:43.930> raiders<00:01:43.960> they<00:01:44.409> have

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
look at the oakland raiders they have

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.590 
look at the oakland raiders they have
the<00:01:44.740> first<00:01:44.920> pick<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.430> don't<00:01:46.000> see<00:01:46.240> them<00:01:46.420> going

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the first pick I don't see them going

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.420 
the first pick I don't see them going
with<00:01:46.810> Quinn<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.710> because<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.009> think<00:01:48.070> they're

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
with Quinn just because I think they're

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.310 
with Quinn just because I think they're
going<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.640> go<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:48.850> Calvin<00:01:49.299> Johnson<00:01:49.780> or<00:01:49.930> if

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
going to go with Calvin Johnson or if

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.870 
going to go with Calvin Johnson or if
they<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.470> go<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> quarterback<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.640> think

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
they do go with the quarterback I think

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.580 
they do go with the quarterback I think
it's<00:01:52.000> going<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.210> be<00:01:52.270> JaMarcus<00:01:52.780> Russell<00:01:52.810> he's

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
it's going to be JaMarcus Russell he's

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's going to be JaMarcus Russell he's
got<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:53.950> big<00:01:54.130> old<00:01:54.340> arm<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.820> think<00:01:55.030> he

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
got that big old arm and I think he

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.550 
got that big old arm and I think he
really<00:01:55.420> fits<00:01:55.600> better<00:01:55.900> with<00:01:56.020> their<00:01:56.290> offensive

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
really fits better with their offensive

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130 
really fits better with their offensive
style<00:01:57.009> Detroit<00:01:58.000> at<00:01:58.150> number<00:01:58.450> two<00:01:58.659> I<00:01:58.900> think

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
style Detroit at number two I think

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
style Detroit at number two I think
they're<00:01:59.290> going<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.439> go<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.680> an<00:01:59.799> NFL<00:02:00.189> tackle

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
they're going to go with an NFL tackle

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700 
they're going to go with an NFL tackle
probably<00:02:01.450> not<00:02:01.540> going<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.750> be<00:02:01.810> coin<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.350> then

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
probably not going to be coin and then

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.800 
probably not going to be coin and then
you<00:02:02.829> look<00:02:03.009> at<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.220> Cleveland<00:02:03.640> Browns<00:02:03.810> they're

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
you look at the Cleveland Browns they're

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.240 
you look at the Cleveland Browns they're
probably<00:02:04.960> gonna<00:02:05.200> be<00:02:05.350> tempted<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.799> take<00:02:05.950> Quinn

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
probably gonna be tempted to take Quinn

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.590 
probably gonna be tempted to take Quinn
but<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:06.460> think<00:02:06.729> they're<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:07.000> take<00:02:07.210> Adrian

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
but I think they're going to take Adrian

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.569 
but I think they're going to take Adrian
Peterson<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.320> then<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.799> look<00:02:08.950> at<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> Box<00:02:09.369> in

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:09.579 
Peterson and then you look at the Box in

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.100 
Peterson and then you look at the Box in
the<00:02:09.610> cards<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.239> don't<00:02:10.420> really<00:02:10.570> need<00:02:10.780> Quinn

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the cards they don't really need Quinn

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.930 
the cards they don't really need Quinn
and<00:02:11.380> then<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:11.860> look<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.220> Redskins<00:02:12.760> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and then you look at the Redskins I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.340 
and then you look at the Redskins I
think<00:02:13.239> they<00:02:13.329> need<00:02:13.510> defense<00:02:13.870> more<00:02:14.079> than<00:02:14.230> they

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
think they need defense more than they

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.199 
think they need defense more than they
need<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.560> quarterback<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.640> leaves<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
need a quarterback so that leaves the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.600 
need a quarterback so that leaves the
Vikings<00:02:16.690> at<00:02:16.840> number<00:02:17.110> seven<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.709> don't<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:18.459> them

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
Vikings at number seven I don't see them

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.729 
Vikings at number seven I don't see them
passing<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.150> Quinn<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.959> them<00:02:20.139> taking<00:02:20.410> him

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
passing on Quinn I see them taking him

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.220 
passing on Quinn I see them taking him
and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
and
do<00:02:21.470> take<00:02:21.709> him<00:02:21.920> they<00:02:22.069> could<00:02:22.220> use<00:02:22.489> him<00:02:22.670> as<00:02:22.760> trade

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
do take him they could use him as trade

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.479 
do take him they could use him as trade
bait<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.840> if<00:02:23.930> they<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.110> pass<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.739> him<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.459> I

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
bait but if they do pass on him then I

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.430 
bait but if they do pass on him then I
think<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.000> Dolphins<00:02:26.209> number<00:02:26.840> nine<00:02:27.019> that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
think the Dolphins number nine that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.410 
think the Dolphins number nine that
they'll<00:02:27.620> pick<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:28.010> Quinn<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.459> actually<00:02:28.940> think

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
they'll pick up Quinn I actually think

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.330 
they'll pick up Quinn I actually think
out<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.599> all<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.080> teams<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.560> Dolphins<00:02:31.069> need

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
out of all the teams the Dolphins need

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.550 
out of all the teams the Dolphins need
him<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.640> most<00:02:31.700> he<00:02:32.180> would<00:02:32.599> shine<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.140> most<00:02:33.319> on

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
him the most he would shine the most on

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.380 
him the most he would shine the most on
their<00:02:33.709> team<00:02:33.920> they<00:02:34.400> need<00:02:34.610> his<00:02:34.730> leadership<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
their team they need his leadership and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.600 
their team they need his leadership and
they<00:02:35.450> need<00:02:35.629> his<00:02:35.780> accuracy<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:36.950> hope<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.340> he

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
they need his accuracy so I hope that he

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.479 
they need his accuracy so I hope that he
goes<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.000> late<00:02:38.299> in<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.569> game<00:02:38.720> ok<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:40.280> it's

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
goes that late in the game ok now it's

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.009 
goes that late in the game ok now it's
either<00:02:40.670> gonna<00:02:40.760> be<00:02:40.879> number<00:02:41.030> seven<00:02:41.330> or<00:02:41.690> number

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
either gonna be number seven or number

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.110 
either gonna be number seven or number
nine<00:02:42.200> that's<00:02:42.650> my<00:02:42.890> prediction<00:02:43.129> but<00:02:43.879> no<00:02:44.000> matter

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
nine that's my prediction but no matter

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.270 
nine that's my prediction but no matter
what<00:02:44.599> round<00:02:44.989> he<00:02:45.230> goes<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.769> think<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.069> Brady

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
what round he goes in I think that Brady

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.009 
what round he goes in I think that Brady
Quinn<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.640> gonna<00:02:46.819> be<00:02:46.910> an<00:02:47.000> amazing<00:02:47.329> NFL

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
Quinn is gonna be an amazing NFL

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.930 
Quinn is gonna be an amazing NFL
