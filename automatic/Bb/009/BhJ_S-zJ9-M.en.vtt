surgery in the same sentence most

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.420 
surgery in the same sentence most
patients<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.770> worried<00:01:29.040> they're<00:01:29.160> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
paralyzed so it is very frightening for
patients<00:01:32.910> it<00:01:33.060> creates<00:01:33.480> a<00:01:33.600> tremendous<00:01:34.050> amount

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
patients it creates a tremendous amount

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.370 
patients it creates a tremendous amount
of<00:01:34.320> anxiety<00:01:35.180> but<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.540> once<00:01:36.870> patients

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
of anxiety but I think once patients

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.110 
of anxiety but I think once patients
understand<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> takes<00:01:38.610> away<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:38.940> of

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
understand and it takes away a lot of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.570 
understand and it takes away a lot of
that<00:01:39.210> fear<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:40.440> where<00:01:40.830> as<00:01:40.950> as<00:01:41.190> cutting

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
that fear I think where as as cutting

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.600 
that fear I think where as as cutting
edges<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.450> possibly<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.230> be<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:44.400> using
