drives date that okay when your Samsung
you<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:37.920> build<00:00:38.690> every<00:00:39.690> component<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you actually build every component of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.700 
you actually build every component of
the<00:00:40.739> SSD<00:00:41.190> nobody<00:00:41.940> else<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.719> even<00:00:42.960> Intel

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the SSD nobody else does that even Intel

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.060 
the SSD nobody else does that even Intel
I<00:00:43.950> mean<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:44.730> fab<00:00:44.969> flash<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.800> flash

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
I mean they fab flash so they do flash

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660 
I mean they fab flash so they do flash
um<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.129> their<00:00:50.219> own<00:00:50.280> controller

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
um they don't do their own controller

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.600 
um they don't do their own controller
anymore<00:00:51.500> okay<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.770> let's<00:00:52.949> find<00:00:53.190> those<00:00:53.399> find

other guys ah micron doesn't use their

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
other guys ah micron doesn't use their
own<00:00:57.420> controller<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.739> their<00:00:58.890> own<00:00:58.920> flash

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
own controller they use their own flash

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
own controller they use their own flash
but<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.730> their<00:00:59.879> own<00:00:59.969> controller<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.539> mean<00:01:00.960> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
but not their own controller I mean you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
but not their own controller I mean you
look<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.289> guys<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.440> ocz<00:01:02.129> where<00:01:02.370> they're

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
look at guys like ocz where they're

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.179 
look at guys like ocz where they're
designing<00:01:02.969> firmwares<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.840> they<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.890> working

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
designing firmwares and they are working

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
designing firmwares and they are working
on<00:01:05.430> controller<00:01:05.939> designs<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.900> but

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on controller designs and all that but

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
on controller designs and all that but
they<00:01:07.170> don't<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.470> build<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.540> they

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
they don't actually build it and they

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.570 
they don't actually build it and they
don't<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.320> fab<00:01:10.530> flash<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
don't actually fab flash they just get

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
don't actually fab flash they just get
huge<00:01:12.060> volume<00:01:12.390> discounts<00:01:12.869> due<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> their

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
huge volume discounts due to their

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160 
huge volume discounts due to their
hugeness<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.130> Samsung<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.360> only<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
hugeness so Samsung is the only one that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.800 
hugeness so Samsung is the only one that
actually<00:01:16.530> builds<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> entire<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:18.090> from

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually builds the entire thing from

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
actually builds the entire thing from
the<00:01:19.170> ground<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.890> every<00:01:20.220> possible<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:21.140> what

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the ground up in every possible way what

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
the ground up in every possible way what
advantages<00:01:22.650> does<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> give<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> well<00:01:23.520> number

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
advantages does that give it well number

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
advantages does that give it well number
one<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> gives<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> cost<00:01:25.170> advantage<00:01:25.350> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
one it gives them a cost advantage so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.219 
one it gives them a cost advantage so
they<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.400> deliver<00:01:26.670> high-performance

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
they can deliver high-performance

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.260 
they can deliver high-performance
products<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.650> competitive<00:01:28.829> costs<00:01:29.579> what

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
products at very competitive costs what

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
products at very competitive costs what
other<00:01:30.420> advantages<00:01:30.930> does<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.229> give<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
other advantages does it give them it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.219 
other advantages does it give them it
gives<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.280> full<00:01:32.729> control<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> creative

because the Heike app there you go

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.069 
because the Heike app there you go
there's<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.710> ambiguity<00:01:53.000> about<00:01:54.000> who<00:01:54.840> screwed

the desktop upgrade version of their

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.219 
the desktop upgrade version of their
Drive<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> comes<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> full<00:02:00.570> retail<00:02:00.899> box

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
notebook you have this is also a slim

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.040 
notebook you have this is also a slim
SSD<00:04:56.490> which<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.120> great<00:04:57.360> because<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.780> means<00:04:57.930> that

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
SSD which is great because it means that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.400 
SSD which is great because it means that
you<00:04:58.260> can<00:04:58.410> install<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.770> anywhere<00:05:00.410> some

that much more on some SSDs makes them a

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.150 
that much more on some SSDs makes them a
