hey guys you're watching fitness regimen

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.889 
hey guys you're watching fitness regimen
and<00:00:01.770> today<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:02.760> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.030> talk<00:00:03.240> about<00:00:03.449> smite

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
and today I'm going to talk about smite

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.550 
and today I'm going to talk about smite
smite<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> fairly<00:00:05.220> new<00:00:05.520> mobile<00:00:05.940> game<00:00:06.120> and

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
smite is a fairly new mobile game and

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.780 
smite is a fairly new mobile game and
the<00:00:07.560> reason<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.010> like<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:08.400> much<00:00:08.580> is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the reason that I like it so much is

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.339 
the reason that I like it so much is
because<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:09.210> different<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> has<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.990> third

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
because it's different it has a third

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.669 
because it's different it has a third
person<00:00:10.679> view<00:00:11.309> rather<00:00:11.940> than<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> top<00:00:12.540> down<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.049> I

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
person view rather than a top down and I

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.920 
person view rather than a top down and I
haven't<00:00:13.920> seen<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.250> before<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.929> terms<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
haven't seen that before and in terms of

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.730 
haven't seen that before and in terms of
champions<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.050> whatever<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.590> call

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
champions or whatever you want to call

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
champions or whatever you want to call
them<00:00:19.800> they're<00:00:20.130> called<00:00:20.369> gods<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:21.060> smite<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
them they're called gods in smite and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
them they're called gods in smite and
they're<00:00:22.199> based<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.680> real<00:00:22.859> gods<00:00:23.160> such<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.609> loki

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
they're based on real gods such as loki

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.040 
they're based on real gods such as loki
thor<00:00:24.060> Anubis<00:00:25.019> raw<00:00:25.710> etc<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.390> game<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thor Anubis raw etc the game is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.200 
thor Anubis raw etc the game is
different<00:00:28.920> also<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> has<00:00:29.849> multiple

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
different also because it has multiple

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060 
different also because it has multiple
maps<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> don't<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.529> bored<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.920> them

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
prefer it because in most mobile games

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
prefer it because in most mobile games
it<00:01:05.220> takes<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.640> 40<00:01:05.970> minutes<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.570> an<00:01:06.780> hour

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it takes like 40 minutes up to an hour

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
it takes like 40 minutes up to an hour
play<00:01:07.710> game<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
play game but in this one if I want to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
play game but in this one if I want to
play<00:01:09.090> 15<00:01:09.479> minute<00:01:09.750> game<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> could<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.290> join<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
play 15 minute game I could just join a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
play 15 minute game I could just join a
job<00:01:10.799> store<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.130> arena<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> that's<00:01:12.420> typically

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
job store an arena and that's typically

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
job store an arena and that's typically
how<00:01:13.020> long<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.530> lost<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> good<00:01:15.090> way

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
how long they lost also it's a good way

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
how long they lost also it's a good way
to<00:01:15.240> learn<00:01:15.450> God's<00:01:15.840> you'll<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.350> there's

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to learn God's you'll see there's

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
to learn God's you'll see there's
different<00:01:17.310> tactics<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:17.970> view<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
different tactics in one view on so you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
different tactics in one view on so you
never<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:18.990> bored<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.729> it's<00:01:20.729> based

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
never really get bored of it it's based

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
never really get bored of it it's based
on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> Unreal<00:01:21.509> Engine<00:01:21.750> 4<00:01:21.930> engine<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:22.740> I'm

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
on the Unreal Engine 4 engine which I'm

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.940 
on the Unreal Engine 4 engine which I'm
familiar<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> graphics<00:01:25.830> are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
familiar with and so the graphics are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
familiar with and so the graphics are
very<00:01:25.979> pleasant<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> mean<00:01:26.729> they're<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.479> super

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
very pleasant I mean they're not super

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.450 
very pleasant I mean they're not super
high-end<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:29.189> higher<00:01:29.430> than

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
high-end but they're much higher than

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
high-end but they're much higher than
most<00:01:29.850> MOBAs<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.600> I've<00:01:30.750> seen<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.920> terms<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
most MOBAs that I've seen in terms of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.999 
most MOBAs that I've seen in terms of
play<00:01:32.460> styles<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.780> similar<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> MMOs<00:01:34.799> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
play styles it's very similar to MMOs in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
play styles it's very similar to MMOs in
terms<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> moving<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.270> need<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> aim

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
terms of moving you need to aim

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.899 
terms of moving you need to aim
abilities<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:38.130> move<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.520> WASD<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.799> you

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909
