00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:11.250
 so hello everybody with you again master 47 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 same vaganovich also masters for today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.650
 from I drive through the cadu decided all the same 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 show how much better it became after 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.750
 firmware more precisely after chip tuning ford 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 focus 3 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.599
 I repeat for those who have not heard did not see 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.599
 does not know machine16 125 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.400
 after chip tuning 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.400
 actually improved traction on bottoms 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 improved responsiveness of the accelerator pedal and of 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.219
 so now I will notice how 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.769
 maybe a little bit more expensive like you 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:57.109
 It reduces the cost of meals in the city now! 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.610
 try I will show steam 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.549
 tachometer actually how are we going 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.750
 there are regular momentum here we all stand 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.030
 car warmed up 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:15.289
 all 810 820 tachometer revolution now we 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.100
 will get under way as if the Lord Snow 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:22.009
 missed how are we going to look like he 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.060
 we picked up from 1 to 2 so we went 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.060
 first went 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.910
 that is, we are now going to the second 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.080
 even from the first now a little about 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.630
 skidded hand twisted 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.940
 power increased uniquely here 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.160
 example imitate traffic jam yes here we go 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.960
 On the second 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.970
 We drop this item here hour speed 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:02:00.240
 We are 20 that is, the idea is that it is stitched 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.550
 there is no car thrust we give it gas 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.470
 went this in second gear in this 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:14.640
 question 3 give a little bit under dispersed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:17.489
 is up to a third actually traction on bottoms here 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.280
 she now now we go to 3 2 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:24.100
 kilograms per tachometer 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:28.640
 speed 40 something we give lord 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 went 4th gear 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.099
 already asks 5 everything is enough in principle 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.700
 gear ratios to enable 5 he 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:45.969
 she pulls off all speed 70 80 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.870
 went to x kilograms that is now we 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.870
 drive fifth gear 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.780
 for such a micro 2 it is generally the most 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.790
 such an economical regime turned 80 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.260
 kilometers per hour responsiveness to fagot 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.760
 This is still considering that this is the fifth 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.760
 transfer pond lord we went 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.010
 so what's the gas is not in the floor is still just 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.350
 normal driving style 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.270
 here we go at 5 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.360
 nice and good part will mimic 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.360
 on the 5th move, mark 4 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.550
 we go 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.550
 by the way 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.580
 include 3 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.740
 although she immediately writes giving including 4 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.020
 arrow once we go 3 for 2 with 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.410
 half a thousand turns you for example 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.450
 we need to accelerate now 60 starting 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.330
 give gazku 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.510
 gazku gave so about 2 22 centimeters 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.780
 pedal 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.459
 that is, a few seconds and all 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.459
 speed is already 90 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.880
 that is , we will give him more 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.270
 reception reception and not sickly 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.440
 I have to show what it is showing 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.900
 here is this basement once 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.110
 firmware, I mean, I fucking well matyugalas 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.599
 because it was impossible that's just 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.849
 a little lower here 2 and a half you fell 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:37.300
 all need to downshift 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.370
 to make the expense he didn't rush on 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.180
 fucking 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.629
 Now what we're all going now 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.069
 fourth gear 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:52.670
 descended to these sighted former 300 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.420
 give gentlemen 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.080
 having gone 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.080
 but dill 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.690
 on the pickup per meter while doing so 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.960
 that the motor is not some or this 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.760
 here , after all, 1 of 6 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.120
 so I think that 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.530
 were the firmware succeeded motor as 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.540
 collapsed then naturally he is powerful 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.270
 strangled with all these europe across europe 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.470
 what guys stitch ride and not 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:31.060
 nervous and good bottom 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:34.960
 less about fears of sticks and nails on 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.900
 road with you poganochki all the best 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.900
 meetings, I drove home quietly
