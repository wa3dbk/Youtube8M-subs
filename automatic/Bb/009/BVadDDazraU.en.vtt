those<00:02:26.570> pictures<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.550> can<00:02:28.670> also<00:02:28.790> do

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
those pictures but what you can also do

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.290 
those pictures but what you can also do
is<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.620> use<00:02:30.980> for<00:02:31.250> grounder<00:02:31.820> which<00:02:32.000> it

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
is is is a use for grounder which it

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.820 
is is is a use for grounder which it
highlights<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> subject<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.590> want<00:02:33.770> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
highlights the subject that you want to

highlights the subject that you want to
a<00:02:33.920> focal<00:02:34.550> point<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:35.210> can<00:02:35.330> even<00:02:35.540> cut<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.020> paste

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320

create an alibi for you I don't know it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.840 
create an alibi for you I don't know it
could<00:02:45.500> be<00:02:45.680> something<00:02:45.860> new<00:02:46.100> you're<00:02:46.370> interested

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
could be something new you're interested

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.990 
could be something new you're interested
in<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.410> other<00:02:48.410> aspect<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.950> lose<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.340> actually

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
in the other aspect you lose is actually

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.930 
in the other aspect you lose is actually
add<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.720> bit<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.110> three-dimensional<00:02:52.040> images

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
add a bit of three-dimensional images

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.210 
add a bit of three-dimensional images
into<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.510> actual<00:02:53.780> picture<00:02:54.170> itself<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.800> you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
into the actual picture itself so you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.070 
into the actual picture itself so you
can<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:55.490> what's<00:02:55.670> called<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.120> dimension<00:02:56.840> plus

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
can do what's called a dimension plus

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.260 
can do what's called a dimension plus
and<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.620> uses<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.010> layer<00:02:58.430> information<00:02:59.090> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
and it uses the layer information the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.910 
and it uses the layer information the
picture<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.720> create<00:03:00.140> something<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:00.890> just

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
picture to create something you can just

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.400 
picture to create something you can just
slightly<00:03:01.580> change<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.240> angle<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.810> picture

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
slightly change the angle of the picture

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.590 
slightly change the angle of the picture
itself<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.010> really<00:03:04.250> creates<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.760> really<00:03:05.210> cool

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
itself so really creates a really cool

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.410 
itself so really creates a really cool
effect<00:03:05.810> when<00:03:06.410> when<00:03:06.860> using<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.400> pictures<00:03:08.060> it

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
effect when when using the pictures it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.990 
effect when when using the pictures it
makes<00:03:08.750> basically<00:03:09.530> really<00:03:10.160> simple<00:03:10.670> pictures

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
makes basically really simple pictures

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.220 
makes basically really simple pictures
that<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.150> take<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.540> can<00:03:11.690> make<00:03:11.870> them<00:03:11.990> look

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
that you take it you can make them look

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.320 
that you take it you can make them look
beautiful<00:03:12.770> with<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> bouquet<00:03:13.190> effect<00:03:13.730> or<00:03:13.910> you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
beautiful with a bouquet effect or you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.790 
beautiful with a bouquet effect or you
can<00:03:14.450> just<00:03:14.510> add<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> bit<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.110> dimension<00:03:15.320> with

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
can just add a bit of dimension with

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.930 
can just add a bit of dimension with
that<00:03:15.950> dimension<00:03:16.370> class<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:16.730> all<00:03:16.790> that

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
that dimension class and all that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.760 
that dimension class and all that
information<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.540> stored<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.590> normal

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
information is stored in a normal

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.410 
information is stored in a normal
picture<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.940> don't<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.330> about

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
picture so you just don't think about

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.810 
picture so you just don't think about
it's<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> one-shot<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.800> don't<00:03:22.160> have<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.610> hold

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
it's a one-shot you don't have to hold

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's a one-shot you don't have to hold

the the screen is so sensitive that the
tapping<00:06:32.680> works<00:06:32.919> through<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.630> because<00:06:34.630> we

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
tapping works through the because we

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.019

outstanding<00:07:06.699> and<00:07:07.120> it<00:07:07.419> allows<00:07:07.750> me<00:07:07.860> after<00:07:08.860> the

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
outstanding and it allows me after the

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.680 
outstanding and it allows me after the
fact<00:07:09.159> it's<00:07:09.430> going<00:07:09.550> to<00:07:09.789> make<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.210> shots<00:07:10.449> that<00:07:10.569> I

fact it's going to make the shots that I

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.270 
fact it's going to make the shots that I
should<00:07:10.960> have<00:07:11.080> made<00:07:11.229> because<00:07:11.500> I<00:07:11.860> don't<00:07:12.190> have

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
should have made because I don't have

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.860 
should have made because I don't have
that<00:07:12.460> artistic<00:07:12.879> intent<00:07:13.389> when<00:07:13.569> I'm<00:07:13.690> actually

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
edit so that's the reason why I like the

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.330
