00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
on the phone pretty straightforward it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.449 
on the phone pretty straightforward it
does<00:01:45.639> have<00:01:46.119> some<00:01:46.869> soft<00:01:47.259> touch<00:01:47.619> materials<00:01:47.649> so

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
does have some soft touch materials so

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.639 
does have some soft touch materials so
it<00:01:48.579> won't<00:01:48.759> damage<00:01:48.939> your<00:01:49.209> phone<00:01:49.509> so<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.499> think

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.059 
them to so that's really nice and I like
how<00:03:32.480> you<00:03:32.540> can<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.079> see<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.260> bead<00:03:33.680> of<00:03:33.920> that

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
how you can just see the bead of that

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.069 
how you can just see the bead of that
stitching<00:03:34.370> running<00:03:34.790> across<00:03:35.000> there<00:03:35.359> I<00:03:35.569> think

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
stitching running across there I think

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.360 
stitching running across there I think
that's<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.410> nice<00:03:36.650> across<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.040> top<00:03:37.340> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's really nice across the top and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.030 
that's really nice across the top and
bottom<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.209> I'm<00:03:38.690> like<00:03:38.870> how<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.109> have<00:03:39.470> really

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
bottom and I'm like how you have really

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.150 
bottom and I'm like how you have really
easy<00:03:40.220> access<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.790> your<00:03:41.630> s<00:03:41.810> page<00:03:42.079> so<00:03:42.709> that's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
easy access to your s page so that's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.120 
easy access to your s page so that's
really<00:03:43.489> cool<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.090> again<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.380> most<00:03:45.650> important

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
really cool and again the most important

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.680 
really cool and again the most important
feature<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.700> case<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.209> this<00:03:47.329> magnetic

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
feature of this case is this magnetic

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.589 
feature of this case is this magnetic
kickstand<00:03:48.260> which<00:03:48.829> will<00:03:49.639> allow<00:03:49.880> me<00:03:50.269> to<00:03:50.419> do<00:03:50.569> that

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
kickstand which will allow me to do that

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.199 
kickstand which will allow me to do that
when<00:03:51.049> I'm<00:03:51.260> either<00:03:51.680> doing<00:03:52.250> something<00:03:52.760> else<00:03:52.940> if

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
when I'm either doing something else if

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.409 
when I'm either doing something else if
I'm<00:03:53.359> skyping<00:03:53.660> if<00:03:54.319> i'm<00:03:55.090> watching<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.150> video

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
I'm skyping if i'm watching the video

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.360 
I'm skyping if i'm watching the video
whatever<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.930> case<00:03:57.079> may<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.680> still

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
whatever the case may be and still

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.220 
whatever the case may be and still
consume<00:03:58.790> media<00:03:59.030> while<00:03:59.359> having<00:03:59.810> my<00:03:59.900> hands-free

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
consume media while having my hands-free

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.949 
consume media while having my hands-free
to<00:04:00.500> do<00:04:00.620> something<00:04:00.980> else<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.720> again<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.750> don't

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
to do something else so again I don't

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.930 
to do something else so again I don't
