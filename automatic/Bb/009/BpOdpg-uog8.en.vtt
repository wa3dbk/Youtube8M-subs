tighten it up around there this presses

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.900 
tighten it up around there this presses
against<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> drum

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
against the drum

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.430 
against the drum
that<00:02:13.030> means<00:02:13.210> you've<00:02:13.360> got<00:02:13.390> an<00:02:13.630> extra<00:02:13.990> way<00:02:14.170> of

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that means you've got an extra way of

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.160 
that means you've got an extra way of
adjusting<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:15.160> tension<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.990> either

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
adjusting the tension so you either

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.740 
adjusting the tension so you either
adjust<00:02:17.530> attention<00:02:18.190> by<00:02:18.420> tightening<00:02:19.420> up<00:02:19.540> these

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
adjust attention by tightening up these

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.620 
adjust attention by tightening up these
nuts<00:02:20.670> inside<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.330> whether<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.540> can

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
nuts inside there then whether you can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.140 
nuts inside there then whether you can
see<00:02:22.900> there's<00:02:23.260> nuts<00:02:23.500> that's<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.490> normal<00:02:24.670> way

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
see there's nuts that's a normal way

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.600 
see there's nuts that's a normal way
or<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.720> can<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.080> screw<00:02:26.440> this<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:26.860> tighter<00:02:27.370> or

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
or you can just screw this up tighter or

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.360 
or you can just screw this up tighter or
looser<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.840> that's<00:02:29.020> quite<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> unique<00:02:29.500> way<00:02:30.340> of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
looser so that's quite a unique way of

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.570 
looser so that's quite a unique way of
adjusting<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.910> tension<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.890> wood<00:02:33.100> on<00:02:33.310> this

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
adjusting the tension the wood on this

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.540 
adjusting the tension the wood on this
I've<00:02:34.480> kept<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> all<00:02:35.530> original<00:02:36.010> which<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.310> and
