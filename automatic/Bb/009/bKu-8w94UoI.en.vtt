claim to that hot liquids on hot days
are<00:01:19.229> better<00:01:19.409> first<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> an<00:01:20.369> experiential

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
are better first on an experiential

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
are better first on an experiential
level<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> drink<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:22.049> hot<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
level when you drink something hot it

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.340 
level when you drink something hot it
does<00:01:23.100> lead<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> us<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:24.630> degree<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> sweating

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
does lead to us some degree of sweating

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
does lead to us some degree of sweating
usually<00:01:25.920> unnoticeable<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.240> there's<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
usually unnoticeable but there's it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
usually unnoticeable but there's it
leads<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.290> extra<00:01:28.740> moisture<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.280> skin

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
leads to some extra moisture on the skin

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.149 
leads to some extra moisture on the skin
when<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> warmer<00:01:30.900> hot<00:01:31.110> breeze<00:01:31.409> hits<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
when a warmer hot breeze hits that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.620 
when a warmer hot breeze hits that
moisture<00:01:32.670> it'll<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.000> experienced<00:01:33.479> by<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
moisture it'll be experienced by the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.130 
moisture it'll be experienced by the
body<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.170> something<00:01:35.159> cool<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.700> opposed<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.509> hot

breeze or hot wind on hot skin where it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
breeze or hot wind on hot skin where it
just<00:01:40.680> makes<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> more<00:01:41.460> hot<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:44.540> science<00:01:45.540> also

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
just makes it more hot but science also

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.060 
just makes it more hot but science also
backs<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> claim<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:49.140> major<00:01:49.619> ways
