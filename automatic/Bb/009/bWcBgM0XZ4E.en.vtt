00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.280
 not good 

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.380
 do not judge 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.380
 not the left one 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.569
 Well 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.749
 Well 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.859
 Has 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.460
 ORF at 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.499
 from Natasha alone 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.400
 the investigators but just about to get them crying as possible the 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.059
 to be entitled to the necessary votes 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.829
 and that's exactly what we're dealing with here at the Cisco Trainings third 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.309
 new function of the author 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.710
 is a real eye-catcher 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.730
 we call that Damien Carrel whistling 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.150
 So welcome to wash and I may 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
 b 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.640
 unfortunately, the frequent washing was also at the expense of shine and beauty 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.800
 why because tiny pebbles dust or sand in the wash water 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 be smeared by lawyers on the paint 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.210
 in this laboratory car wash creating exactly this strain after a quasi 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 Car life in fast motion 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 the result fell in the worst case 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 in the top layer of earth in the clear coat are already after a few German fans 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.390
 Â«Tommy Kuckertz emerged 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 the brilliant balance remains 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.850
 had to be improved lag and therefore we felt differently that was 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 not so easy because this top layer of paint is still half as thick as 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.180
 a human hair 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.950
 nevertheless criticism once everything off 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.350
 Cod dissolved salt gasoline from free run sand and rockfall 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.620
 in any weather 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.240
 these are quite extreme and an example as the legal requirement 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.260
 Hardness and elasticity are actually two opposite factors to her 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.369
 Interaction is very important at McLaren 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.009
 here a material would have the less scratches a steel cabinet at one 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:14.830
 Glass pane will not hurt 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.139
 the glass until the 8th 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.809
 actually perfect 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:23.179
 But who ever shot one against the glass soon has the price that 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.329
 Glass is not particularly elastic 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.169
 it breaks and because of its hardness unsportsmanlike behavior 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.909
 Northern rivals are also deformed, we do not notice the plus, for example if 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.189
 close the doors and trunk works 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.049
 the bad luck prohibits 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.859
 and the team had to lay course, of course 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.219
 what happens if he does not do the so-called deep and examinations time 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.849
 We compare a particularly hard lag with Alberts Piratenakt travels from 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.209
 Place of Blecher 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.409
 Althaus, on the other hand, before dealing with the material 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.080
 and that is the great strength of 1 quasi the special feature 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.940
 Albers is a so-called amount 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.459
 It consists of two different components first 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.859
 they are the inorganic they the Kurt grid 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.610
 You can imagine that like a blasphemous structure 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.610
 very hard their cars for persistent 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:23.459
 This roasted is as flexible as it is wrapped in organic material 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.799
 rubber 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.650
 Together they form a perfect team Eiglers gets less micro scratches 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.029
 As all other clear coat the car is not only better protected it looks 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.619
 also much longer from the north 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.719
 that is very important because we were of course a scratch resistant 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.869
 Shining varnish to create its properties over a long time 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:47.089
 Period at tel 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.979
 for a long time among motorists 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:50.820
 in it
