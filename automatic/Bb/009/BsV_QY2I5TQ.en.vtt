00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.730
 Hello everyone, you brazenly 73 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.670
 and today we'll talk about the very 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.830
 discussed tanks which if not all of that 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.380
 very many players of the world of tanks blitz 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.320
 want to put it in the hangar 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.960
 Soviet heavy tank level 6 tank 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.430
 who possesses truly huge women 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.439
 alky square-2 let's start with its trump card is 150 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.640
 two millimeter logs honey which 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.429
 if it hits the enemy 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.989
 it will not seem to him to use 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.359
 whom 2 on armor-piercing shells 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.539
 Generally our main contraindicated 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.339
 ammunition projectiles in bombs let it 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.809
 they pierce eighty-six 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.329
 millimeters it will be us 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.760
 plenty of armor piercing not even 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.010
 try to shoot there pierce and all 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.709
 110 millimeters something that you are unlikely 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.209
 you will always blow somebody 

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:00.549
 will do damage 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:02.799
 and karma and boards are not particularly armored 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.740
 cars will cry and beg for mercy 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.170
 just not to get a powerful mine 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.840
 let us have accuracy at 06 and time 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.460
 Profile 4 seconds compared to the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.450
 the pleasure that you will receive 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.020
 playing apt-2 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.180
 these are mere little things yes and if you just 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.460
 want to go through a tank and not leave it 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.030
 yourself in the hangar then you have guns 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.760
 IS-6 which punches and with accuracy 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.010
 everything is not bad but I still think that 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.410
 Apt-2 is the primary tank for 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.290
 get fun and enjoy the game 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.360
 so we put babakhu and bend all 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.820
 living is now about the dynamics 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.550
 the tango seemed quite agile and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.860
 maneuverable with a mass of 54 tons and 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.830
 engine power 600 horsepower 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.050
 we have a power density of 11 horses 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.600
 per ton maximum speed as for 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.180
 heavy is also not bad and is 35 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.909
 kilometers per hour since we are a heavy tank 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.080
 then focus on the dynamics especially 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.060
 not now about armor in the forehead apt-2 75 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.340
 millimeters getting bounce from 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.690
 classmates and tanks one level lower 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.629
 we will 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.780
 but as for tanks 7 and 8 level 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:15.430
 here especially the armor will not help and will help 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.769
 our woman hulka 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.620
 since the enemy will be upon us simply 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.930
 scary to leave because if we break through it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.810
 then the enemy or the crew will go crazy 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.359
 and he will come out of the car or we are very 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.299
 badly damage the modules go to 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.219
 tactics of combat since ev2 is a tank 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.290
 with a powerful weapon then being on top 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.959
 list we play attacking 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.590
 After all, not everyone will get to get us 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.599
 at 640 points, not everyone wants when 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.340
 we are at the bottom of the list then hold on 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.730
 allies and try to the maximum 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 provide support or try to get around 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.980
 the enemy from the rear and throw him in the stern 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 in most cases a single shot with 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.510
 breaking through will be enough to set fire 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.629
 the enemy and take him to flight 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.230
 let's consider all the pros and cons 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.340
 This car to the pluses can be attributed 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.189
 huge one-time damage 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.620
 good dynamics to the cons low 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.779
 accuracy and information speed summing up 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.359
 results I want to say that apt-2 should 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:18.849
 stand at each tanker without exception 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.799
 After all, playing it is very interesting and 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.279
 every fight on this unit will 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.249
 bring 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.919
 a lot of emotion and pleasure as well on this 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.389
 I say goodbye to you all thanks for
