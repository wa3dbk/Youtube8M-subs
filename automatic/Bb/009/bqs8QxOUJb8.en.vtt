00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 hi everyone knows metaphase 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.119
 today I'm going to do a little 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.290
 video already to tell you that I have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.779
 a new intro you could see it 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.270
 at the beginning of the video 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.430
 intro created by Captain Flam 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.579
 so I thank him very much and I 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.739
 will give the link of his chain in the east 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.170
 in the description 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.989
 so he gave me an intro last night 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.780
 nice enough and so well I thank him 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.820
 a lot and so is it will be the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.230
 third or fourth I know more 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 video pvp so here we are going to go 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.890
 immediately looked for a pvp fight and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 I'm going to comment on it so that's not even 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.059
 need to search enough it's angelo 8 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.000
 so a pretty good grime of my 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.000
 server so who challenged me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.040
 m 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.040
 so I accepted the challenge so a cra 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 10.5 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.050
 we thought big shots of reindeer 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.020
 the beginning of the fight 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.320
 so I'm going to do a little mastery 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.650
 and i also want roxy from the beginning of the 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.300
 fight so the cre a so that's ok this 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.240
 judge is in my opinion very nagging so 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:46.270
 she does not rattle all but pm talking 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.440
 of them is so here I want more than 4 pm 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.280
 but here are the benefits otherwise I would have 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.280
 could attract him 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.820
 and good 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.540
 a little I can box you and tactics 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.490
 for you and whose cat do one who 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.170
 tap the flying sword so the deal 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.580
 who can you type either you or 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.930
 the enemy so that's annoying since 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.360
 especially when it's an iron cat 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.350
 financial 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.160
 he taps a little near the three without 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.960
 damage and you withdraw a pm so that's 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.370
 it's hard enough so the lacra who goes who 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.970
 will stand here storage what for what 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 that I can reach it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:41.020
 so the cra who will play because I 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:45.220
 can reach it anyway so the grc 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.800
 is more than 731 of life the crack and in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.980
 yvan roll I find this super headdress 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.650
 beautiful personally to what you in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.180
 think-blowing objects to herlies 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.800
 which wind you prefer 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.230
 personally I could do it 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.900
 freewheel alas not obliged to go a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:12.030
 little so she tells me gg I'm told I 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.030
 also because it played well 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.390
 and so here is a little fight very very 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:25.700
 quick pvp against a skull level 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.960
 199 so so here I hope this 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.650
 video will have pleased you it was especially for 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.480
