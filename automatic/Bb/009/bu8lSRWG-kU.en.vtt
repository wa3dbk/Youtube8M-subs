batteries contacted as it was like

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
batteries contacted as it was like
rattling<00:01:13.860> around<00:01:14.010> back<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> it

rattling around back there and it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.039 
rattling around back there and it
shorted<00:01:16.049> dead<00:01:16.619> short<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> ground<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.049> smoke

the<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.470> wires<00:01:19.770> connecting<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.820> battery

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770

booster batteries to the main unit and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.480 
booster batteries to the main unit and
the<00:01:25.650> result<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.500> burned<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> wires

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the result is it just burned the wires

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.690 
the result is it just burned the wires
and<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.420> wires<00:01:30.659> themselves<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.700> became

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and the wires themselves actually became

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
and the wires themselves actually became
a<00:01:32.759> fuse<00:01:33.409> pardon<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> mess<00:01:34.680> camping<00:01:35.490> trip

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
a fuse pardon the mess camping trip

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.389 
a fuse pardon the mess camping trip
recovery<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:38.840> basically<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:42.140> ended<00:01:43.140> up

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
recovery here but basically I ended up

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.179 
recovery here but basically I ended up
burning<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.790> dislike<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.960> think<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.710> 16

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
burning this dislike I think it's a 16

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
burning this dislike I think it's a 16
to<00:01:47.520> 16<00:01:48.030> gauge<00:01:49.670> wires<00:01:50.810> anyway<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.890> had<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to 16 gauge wires anyway if I had a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.480 
to 16 gauge wires anyway if I had a
brain<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.729> head<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.180> would<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.979> put<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> fuse

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
brain in my head I would have put a fuse

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.030 
brain in my head I would have put a fuse
inline<00:01:57.210> fuse<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.840> either<00:01:58.020> probably<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
inline fuse like either probably on the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
inline fuse like either probably on the
positive<00:01:59.520> side<00:01:59.549> just<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> stay<00:02:00.750> with

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
positive side just to stay with

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.560 
positive side just to stay with
convention<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.070> matter

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
convention but it doesn't really matter

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
convention but it doesn't really matter
but<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.590> blown<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.979> fuse

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
but then it would have blown the fuse

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
but then it would have blown the fuse
all<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> would<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.420> done<00:02:06.540> was

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
all I would have had to have done was

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.270 
all I would have had to have done was
off<00:02:07.020> wiring<00:02:07.560> repair<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:10.160> got<00:02:11.160> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
off wiring repair but as it is I got to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.580 
off wiring repair but as it is I got to
clean<00:02:11.489> up<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> suit

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
clean up all the suit

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.770 
clean up all the suit

and the greasy city goop on the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.040 
and the greasy city goop on the
batteries<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.390> hopefully<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.660> batteries

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
batteries and hopefully the batteries

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.449 
batteries and hopefully the batteries
aren't<00:02:21.230> damaged<00:02:21.739> I'm<00:02:22.069> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
aren't damaged I'm going to have to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.869 
aren't damaged I'm going to have to
rebuild<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.120> system<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:25.370> run<00:02:25.760> them

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
rebuild the system and then run them

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.580 
rebuild the system and then run them
through<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.150> charger<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.810> see<00:02:27.470> if

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
through the charger and see if

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.229

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
as stupid as I am later well it's taken

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.320 
as stupid as I am later well it's taken
a<00:02:41.840> couple<00:02:42.049> days<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.739> around<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:44.000> I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
a couple days to get around to it but I

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.289 
a couple days to get around to it but I
finally<00:02:44.810> rebuilt<00:02:45.410> my<00:02:45.739> battery<00:02:46.310> backup<00:02:47.090> power

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
top also our batteries so basically I

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.599 
top also our batteries so basically I
needed<00:03:17.120> fuse<00:03:18.109> protection<00:03:18.799> on<00:03:18.980> both<00:03:19.250> sides<00:03:19.639> now

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
needed fuse protection on both sides now

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.309 
needed fuse protection on both sides now
just<00:03:22.609> let<00:03:22.790> me<00:03:22.819> go<00:03:23.150> back<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.720> caution

you a potential disaster later Here I am
into<00:03:42.440> preparedness<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.370> didn't<00:03:43.639> even<00:03:43.700> put

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
into preparedness and I didn't even put

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.580 
into preparedness and I didn't even put
a<00:03:44.060> fuse<00:03:44.510> into<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:46.790> battery<00:03:47.230> cart<00:03:48.230> up

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
a fuse into the the battery cart up

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.860 
a fuse into the the battery cart up
pathetic<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:51.169> we<00:03:51.349> go<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:52.870> settled<00:03:53.870> for

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
pathetic so here we go I settled for

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.900 
pathetic so here we go I settled for
putting<00:03:56.870> an<00:03:56.989> inline<00:03:57.380> fuse<00:03:57.950> right<00:03:58.310> here<00:03:58.639> at<00:03:58.760> the

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
putting an inline fuse right here at the

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.599 
putting an inline fuse right here at the
positive<00:03:59.480> battery<00:03:59.630> terminal<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.709> then<00:04:01.579> I

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
positive battery terminal and then I

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.589 
positive battery terminal and then I
just<00:04:01.900> secured<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.079> wires<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:05.090> then<00:04:05.329> hooked

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
just secured the wires and then hooked

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.360 
just secured the wires and then hooked
it<00:04:05.780> up<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> little<00:04:08.510> plug<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.190> all

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
it up to a to a little plug this is all

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.420 
it up to a to a little plug this is all
just<00:04:10.609> junk<00:04:11.000> I've<00:04:11.209> had<00:04:11.510> left<00:04:12.109> over<00:04:12.440> from<00:04:12.680> years

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
of being a mechanic be I'm sure you

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.099 
of being a mechanic be I'm sure you
could<00:04:15.319> get<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.680> at<00:04:15.829> Napa<00:04:16.099> or<00:04:16.280> something<00:04:17.109> and

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
could get this at Napa or something and

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.979 
could get this at Napa or something and
then<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.370> as<00:04:19.609> well<00:04:19.910> now<00:04:20.539> this<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.840> a

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
then have this as well now this is a

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.880 
then have this as well now this is a
fuse<00:04:21.349> block<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.300> have<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.840> power<00:04:24.050> going

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
fuse block and I have the power going

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.140 
fuse block and I have the power going
directly<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.760> here

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
directly in here

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.530 
directly in here
here<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.840> then<00:04:27.169> 30<00:04:27.830> 25<00:04:28.400> amp<00:04:28.729> fuse<00:04:29.120> which<00:04:29.360> is

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
here and then 30 25 amp fuse which is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.490 
here and then 30 25 amp fuse which is
plenty<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.530> inverter<00:04:30.949> can't<00:04:31.340> draw<00:04:32.050> 25<00:04:33.050> amps

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
plenty the inverter can't draw 25 amps

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.749 
plenty the inverter can't draw 25 amps
it's<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.310> 1500<00:04:35.030> watt<00:04:35.240> in<00:04:35.539> burger<00:04:36.350> am<00:04:37.130> stebbins

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
it's a 1500 watt in burger am stebbins

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's a 1500 watt in burger am stebbins
volts<00:04:38.090> equals<00:04:38.240> wats<00:04:38.680> 25<00:04:39.680> amps<00:04:40.009> will<00:04:40.130> work<00:04:40.310> fine

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
volts equals wats 25 amps will work fine

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.499 
volts equals wats 25 amps will work fine
the<00:04:41.449> only<00:04:41.690> time<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.080> will<00:04:42.199> blow<00:04:42.410> will<00:04:42.830> be<00:04:42.979> if

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
the only time it will blow will be if

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.020 
the only time it will blow will be if
would<00:04:44.509> be<00:04:44.720> if<00:04:44.870> i<00:04:45.160> shorted<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.280> wire<00:04:46.460> somehow

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
would be if i shorted the wire somehow

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.170 
would be if i shorted the wire somehow
so<00:04:47.990> then<00:04:48.320> basically<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:49.190> this<00:04:49.400> thing<00:04:49.669> if<00:04:49.970> these

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
so then basically if this thing if these

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.240 
so then basically if this thing if these
two<00:04:50.419> wires<00:04:50.600> shorted<00:04:51.199> together<00:04:51.350> somehow<00:04:51.889> like

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
two wires shorted together somehow like

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.860 
two wires shorted together somehow like
got<00:04:53.060> strained<00:04:53.509> or<00:04:53.780> whatever<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.910> insulation

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
got strained or whatever and insulation

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.189 
got strained or whatever and insulation
damaged<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.860> they<00:04:58.370> shorted<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.000> would<00:04:59.960> blow

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
damaged and they shorted it would blow

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.939 
damaged and they shorted it would blow
that<00:05:00.440> fuse<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.400> inline<00:05:01.789> fuse<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.990> then

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949

it would it would be you know safe they

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.930 
it would it would be you know safe they

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
wouldn't burst into flames and the added

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.770 
wouldn't burst into flames and the added
bonus<00:05:11.120> is<00:05:11.539> oh<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.500> also<00:05:13.270> put<00:05:14.270> some<00:05:14.300> battery

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
bonus is oh and I also put some battery

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.330 
bonus is oh and I also put some battery
hold<00:05:15.110> down<00:05:17.050> on<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.229> here<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:18.440> i<00:05:18.590> basically

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
hold down on it here I i basically

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.960 
hold down on it here I i basically
painted<00:05:20.270> up<00:05:20.389> this<00:05:20.620> two<00:05:21.620> by<00:05:21.830> two<00:05:21.889> and<00:05:22.130> threw

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
painted up this two by two and threw

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.760 
painted up this two by two and threw
some<00:05:23.180> wire<00:05:23.389> ties<00:05:23.720> in<00:05:23.990> here<00:05:24.139> just<00:05:24.169> enough<00:05:24.620> to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
some wire ties in here just enough to

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.810 
some wire ties in here just enough to
keep<00:05:25.669> everything<00:05:26.090> all<00:05:26.419> in<00:05:26.449> one<00:05:26.750> piece<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.099> as

keep everything all in one piece and as

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.589 
keep everything all in one piece and as
an<00:05:29.030> added<00:05:29.180> bonus<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:30.110> can<00:05:30.560> actually<00:05:30.740> grab<00:05:31.599> the

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
an added bonus I can actually grab the

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.390 
an added bonus I can actually grab the
thing<00:05:32.870> I'm<00:05:33.020> mi<00:05:33.410> just<00:05:33.620> put<00:05:33.830> a<00:05:33.860> handle<00:05:34.250> like

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
thing I'm mi just put a handle like

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.330 
thing I'm mi just put a handle like
right<00:05:34.639> here<00:05:34.940> but<00:05:35.630> anyway<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:35.990> can<00:05:36.340> disconnect

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
right here but anyway you can disconnect

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.050 
right here but anyway you can disconnect
the<00:05:37.550> plug<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:38.530> then<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.740> batter<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.340> extra

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
the plug and then the batter the extra

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.320 
the plug and then the batter the extra
batteries<00:05:41.539> here<00:05:42.010> are<00:05:43.330> completely

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
batteries here are completely

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:54.640 
batteries here are completely
disconnected<00:05:52.180> it's<00:05:53.180> modular<00:05:53.659> gotta<00:05:54.380> love

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
disconnected it's modular gotta love

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.140 
disconnected it's modular gotta love
that<00:05:55.510> so<00:05:57.250> since<00:05:58.250> I<00:05:58.400> have<00:05:58.430> all<00:05:58.669> these<00:05:58.820> extra

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
that so since I have all these extra

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.810 
that so since I have all these extra
fuses<00:05:59.599> I<00:05:59.750> could<00:05:59.930> actually<00:06:00.110> throw<00:06:00.820> another

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
fuses I could actually throw another

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.000 
fuses I could actually throw another
fuse<00:06:02.210> here<00:06:02.570> which<00:06:02.750> is<00:06:02.930> it's<00:06:03.409> already<00:06:03.620> there

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
fuse here which is it's already there

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.850 
fuse here which is it's already there
but<00:06:04.490> then<00:06:05.210> plug<00:06:05.630> something<00:06:06.020> in<00:06:06.320> here<00:06:06.650> like

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
but then plug something in here like

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.300 
but then plug something in here like
maybe<00:06:07.130> an<00:06:07.400> emergency<00:06:08.150> light<00:06:08.419> or<00:06:08.720> something

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
maybe an emergency light or something

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.580 
maybe an emergency light or something
some<00:06:10.310> kind<00:06:10.520> of<00:06:10.580> big<00:06:10.970> LED<00:06:11.599> lamp<00:06:12.139> or<00:06:12.380> something

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
some kind of big LED lamp or something

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.980 
some kind of big LED lamp or something
so<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.490> could<00:06:13.669> just<00:06:13.849> flip<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.210> on<00:06:14.419> and<00:06:14.690> I'd<00:06:14.810> have

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
so I could just flip it on and I'd have

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.870 
so I could just flip it on and I'd have
light<00:06:16.389> maybe<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.539> bigger<00:06:17.960> 12-volt<00:06:18.740> light<00:06:19.010> in

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
light maybe a bigger 12-volt light in

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.200 
light maybe a bigger 12-volt light in
fact<00:06:20.150> I<00:06:20.270> think<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.570> have<00:06:20.810> one<00:06:21.909> then<00:06:22.909> I<00:06:23.030> could

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
fact I think I have one then I could

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.760 
fact I think I have one then I could
like<00:06:23.360> have<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.659> little<00:06:23.840> thing<00:06:24.409> where<00:06:24.530> I<00:06:24.620> could

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
like have a little thing where I could

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.710 
like have a little thing where I could
pick<00:06:24.979> it<00:06:25.130> up<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:25.490> wave<00:06:25.849> it<00:06:26.030> around<00:06:26.150> and<00:06:26.630> I

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
pick it up and wave it around and I

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.409 
pick it up and wave it around and I
would<00:06:26.870> have<00:06:27.050> plenty<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.740> light<00:06:28.030> that<00:06:29.030> might<00:06:29.270> be

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
would have plenty of light that might be

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.180 
would have plenty of light that might be
worth<00:06:29.570> doing<00:06:30.010> so<00:06:32.020> basically<00:06:33.020> I<00:06:33.050> could<00:06:33.349> connect

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
worth doing so basically I could connect

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.450 
worth doing so basically I could connect
six<00:06:34.849> different<00:06:35.330> appliances<00:06:35.510> or<00:06:36.639> devices

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
six different appliances or devices

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.400 
six different appliances or devices
this<00:06:38.580> little<00:06:38.759> fees<00:06:39.060> block<00:06:39.330> now<00:06:40.020> generally

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
this little fees block now generally

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.309 
this little fees block now generally
this<00:06:40.949> is<00:06:41.009> kind<00:06:41.580> of<00:06:41.639> overkill<00:06:42.240> I<00:06:42.479> just<00:06:42.930> happened

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
this is kind of overkill I just happened

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.080 
this is kind of overkill I just happened
to<00:06:43.350> have<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.530> laying<00:06:43.860> around<00:06:44.280> so<00:06:46.910> that's<00:06:47.910> a

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
to have a laying around so that's a

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.529 
to have a laying around so that's a
little<00:06:48.210> a<00:06:48.840> little<00:06:49.199> better<00:06:49.680> late<00:06:49.979> than<00:06:50.220> never

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
little a little better late than never

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.040 
little a little better late than never
it's<00:06:51.539> got<00:06:51.750> visas<00:06:52.259> now<00:06:52.470> so<00:06:53.509> it<00:06:54.509> probably<00:06:54.780> won't

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
it's got visas now so it probably won't

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.210 
it's got visas now so it probably won't
burst<00:06:55.289> into<00:06:55.620> flames<00:06:55.889> again<00:06:56.280> so<00:06:58.220> lesson

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
burst into flames again so lesson

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:05.570 
burst into flames again so lesson
learned<00:06:59.400> and<00:06:59.970> by<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:00.810> way<00:07:01.580> these<00:07:03.590> that<00:07:04.590> stuff

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
learned and by the way these that stuff

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.490 
learned and by the way these that stuff
that<00:07:05.849> was<00:07:06.030> on<00:07:06.150> here<00:07:06.419> those<00:07:06.630> aren't<00:07:06.930> so<00:07:07.169> that's

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
that was on here those aren't so that's

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.159 
that was on here those aren't so that's
scorch<00:07:08.009> marks<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:09.210> wires<00:07:09.479> just<00:07:09.930> actually

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
scorch marks the wires just actually

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.950 
scorch marks the wires just actually
toasted<00:07:10.919> the<00:07:11.039> casing<00:07:11.520> is<00:07:11.639> a<00:07:11.699> little<00:07:12.000> bit<00:07:12.210> but

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
toasted the casing is a little bit but

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.260 
toasted the casing is a little bit but
it<00:07:13.229> they<00:07:13.590> seem<00:07:13.860> to<00:07:13.889> be<00:07:14.039> holding<00:07:14.310> a<00:07:14.550> charge<00:07:14.759> just

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
it they seem to be holding a charge just

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.430 
it they seem to be holding a charge just
fine<00:07:15.509> so<00:07:16.020> I<00:07:16.470> think<00:07:17.400> I'll<00:07:17.729> just<00:07:18.050> keep<00:07:19.050> them<00:07:19.289> as

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 
fine so I think I'll just keep them as

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.870 
fine so I think I'll just keep them as
long<00:07:19.470> as<00:07:19.800> they<00:07:19.949> go<00:07:20.810> well<00:07:21.810> that's<00:07:22.229> about<00:07:22.440> it

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
long as they go well that's about it

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.880 
long as they go well that's about it
later
