it peaked out at about 75 pounds thrust
static<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.570> stabilized<00:02:54.500> at<00:02:54.740> about<00:02:54.950> 67<00:02:55.790> pounds

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020

which<00:02:57.020> is<00:02:57.050> amazing<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.710> me<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.040> it's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
which is amazing to me because it's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.210 
which is amazing to me because it's
exactly<00:02:58.850> what<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.240> math<00:02:59.390> predicted<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.890> I'm

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
exactly what the math predicted so I'm

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.700 
exactly what the math predicted so I'm
pretty<00:03:01.790> happy<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.080> results<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.620> I

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
pretty happy with with the results and I
