00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
guys use is the a2 which again as I've

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.139 
guys use is the a2 which again as I've
mentioned<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.309> some<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> other<00:00:53.760> videos

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
mentioned in some of the other videos

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
mentioned in some of the other videos
the<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.840> represents<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> second<00:00:56.430> note<00:00:56.760> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the two represents the second note in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
the two represents the second note in
the<00:00:57.360> scale<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> key<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the scale which in the key of a that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.939 
the scale which in the key of a that
would<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.489> B<00:00:59.820> becomes<00:01:00.570> after<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.710> means

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
would be B becomes after a which means

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.850 
would be B becomes after a which means
that<00:01:02.039> basically<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.850> chord<00:01:03.180> an<00:01:04.080> a2<00:01:04.350> would

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that basically in an a chord an a2 would

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
that basically in an a chord an a2 would
leave<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> being<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.990> string<00:01:06.990> open<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
leave the being the string open and the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
leave the being the string open and the
E<00:01:07.770> string<00:01:08.250> open<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.390> basically

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
E string open so that's basically

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240 
E string open so that's basically
meaning<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> we're<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.770> playing<00:01:11.040> these

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
meaning that we're just playing these

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.240 
meaning that we're just playing these
two<00:01:11.580> strings<00:01:12.260> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.500> second<00:01:13.830> fret<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
two strings on the second fret and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
two strings on the second fret and
leaving<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> rest<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.450> them<00:01:15.570> open<00:01:15.960> muting<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
leaving the rest of them open muting the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.399 
leaving the rest of them open muting the
E<00:01:17.040> string<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
E string because we want the a to be the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.219 
E string because we want the a to be the
base<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.580> course<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.119> here's<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.930> basic

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
base in the course so here's your basic

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
base in the course so here's your basic
a2<00:01:22.439> corp<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
a2 corp that is now going to be the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780 
a2 corp that is now going to be the
basis<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.680> chords<00:01:29.070> following<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
basis for all the chords following it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.350 
basis for all the chords following it
okay<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.540> here's<00:01:30.840> our<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.170> chord

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
okay so here's our a chord

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
okay so here's our a chord
the<00:01:33.600> E<00:01:33.630> chord<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.410> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.370> move<00:01:35.460> my

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the E chord is I'm going to move my

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.150 
the E chord is I'm going to move my
index<00:01:35.910> finger<00:01:35.970> down<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.870> string<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.010> a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
index finger down one string to the a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.880 
index finger down one string to the a
string<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.970> muting<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.870> D<00:01:40.200> string<00:01:40.440> with<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
string and muting the D string with the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
string and muting the D string with the
pad<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.790> index<00:01:42.120> finger<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:43.020> basically<00:01:43.380> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
pad of my index finger so basically it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
pad of my index finger so basically it's
going<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.070> an<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.550> suspended<00:01:45.450> because

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
going to be it's an a suspended because

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.680 
going to be it's an a suspended because
it's<00:01:46.050> I'm<00:01:46.500> keeping<00:01:47.010> my<00:01:47.210> middle<00:01:48.210> finger<00:01:48.510> where

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
totally resolved but still kind of works

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.000 
totally resolved but still kind of works
thing<00:01:59.720> d<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.500> same<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
thing d is going to be the same as it is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.710 
thing d is going to be the same as it is
in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> regular<00:02:02.580> key<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.030> D<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.510> played

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
in the regular key of D when we played

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.370 
in the regular key of D when we played
in<00:02:03.870> d<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:05.300> d2<00:02:06.300> leaving<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.050> e<00:02:07.229> string<00:02:07.530> open

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
in d a d2 leaving that e string open

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.570 
in d a d2 leaving that e string open
basically<00:02:10.380> leading<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.950> middle<00:02:11.280> finger

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
basically leading the middle finger

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.330 
basically leading the middle finger
where<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> time<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.230> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.610 

okay<00:02:17.340> again<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:17.970> beauty<00:02:18.300> right<00:02:18.540> there

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
okay again I'm just beauty right there

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.750 
okay again I'm just beauty right there
but<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.739> if<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:19.950> playing<00:02:20.040> an<00:02:20.250> f-sharp<00:02:20.400> minor

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
but then if I'm playing an f-sharp minor

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.150 
but then if I'm playing an f-sharp minor
which<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.390> will<00:02:22.050> probably<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.709> play<00:02:22.980> an<00:02:23.070> F

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
which I will probably have to play an F

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.560 
which I will probably have to play an F
sharp<00:02:23.310> minor<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.760> I'm<00:02:23.880> playing<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.390> key<00:02:24.540> of

sharp minor if I'm playing in the key of

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.990 
sharp minor if I'm playing in the key of
a<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.500> keep<00:02:26.130> my<00:02:26.160> other<00:02:26.489> fingers<00:02:26.880> where

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
a I just keep my other fingers where

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.540 
a I just keep my other fingers where
they<00:02:27.090> are<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.630> use<00:02:28.020> my<00:02:28.230> thumb<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.800> hold<00:02:29.040> down

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
they are and I use my thumb to hold down

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.930 
they are and I use my thumb to hold down
the<00:02:29.700> F<00:02:29.820> sharp<00:02:30.000> right<00:02:30.270> there<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.940> then

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
the F sharp right there and then

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.000 
the F sharp right there and then
sometimes<00:02:33.630> probably<00:02:34.290> going<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> need<00:02:34.530> an<00:02:34.739> e

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
sometimes probably going to need an e

on the C sharp which is very similar to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.009 
on the C sharp which is very similar to
the<00:03:17.799> way<00:03:17.890> we<00:03:18.010> play<00:03:18.189> it<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.400> key<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:18.640> D<00:03:19.019> check

a<00:03:48.849> over<00:03:49.299> C<00:03:49.480> sharp<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.970> was<00:03:51.970> trying<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.180> think<00:03:52.269> of

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
a over C sharp I was trying to think of

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.270 
a over C sharp I was trying to think of
a<00:03:52.599> song<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.049> utilize<00:03:53.530> these<00:03:53.739> chords<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.250> I

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
a song that utilize these chords and I

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.710 
a song that utilize these chords and I
think<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.579> only<00:03:54.609> one<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.120> remember<00:03:55.389> or

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
think the only one I can remember or

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.420 
think the only one I can remember or
then<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.260> can<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.829> that<00:03:56.980> would<00:03:57.069> show<00:03:57.370> you

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
then I can think of that would show you
