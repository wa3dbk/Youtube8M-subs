want to use oil because they're gonna be

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.200 
want to use oil because they're gonna be
quite<00:00:50.850> heavy<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:52.190> flat<00:00:53.190> iron<00:00:53.430> hair<00:00:53.610> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
quite heavy for my flat iron hair is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.069 
quite heavy for my flat iron hair is
going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.539> just<00:00:54.840> wait<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.949> oily<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
going to just wait down and so oily so I

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.299 
going to just wait down and so oily so I
decided<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> use<00:00:58.969> serums<00:00:59.969> instead<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.930> oil<00:01:01.469> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
decided to use serums instead of oil I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.200 
decided to use serums instead of oil I
think<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> lightest<00:01:03.690> or<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.790> use<00:01:05.820> i

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
think the lightest or you can use i

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050 
think the lightest or you can use i
think<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> grape<00:01:06.900> seed<00:01:07.140> oil<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.520> I've<00:01:08.820> got
