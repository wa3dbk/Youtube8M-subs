00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 it would all know arcana is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.279
 today as expected the little 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.460
 tutorial to show you how 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.969
 make your clips in hd to participate 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 at the community editing so qg code I 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 really want everyone to do them 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.789
 rendered because it's really going us 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.170
 allow to edit correctly the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.000
 clips and have a nice quality 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 of image and then that really proves a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 minute you'll see so without 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.910
 transition let's go on sony vegas 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 me it is the 10th of May do not know and that on 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.279
 the eleven or even the new is the same 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 principle 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.099
 it's just that I prefer the saying of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.380
 the interface is just interpreting this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.940
 that actually changes so files 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.700
 property you are going to put the same 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.440
 options that me so image frequency 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.539
 59.94 frames per second optimized mbits 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.469
 Gaussian no if you do not have the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.469
 time to see I advise you to 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.270
 put pause for to see better 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 secondly you go go on your 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.270
 click you're going to do right click 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.309
 property and therefore leave loop unchecked 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 keep the proportions reduce the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.150
 interlace parking you 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 tick and there the most important you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.850
 go put off their 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.070
 sampling the base I had that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.570
 I was at all costs would have disabled 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.860
 their sampling remember that your 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.360
 clip be editable hockey 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.920
 and now rendering so as you 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.650
 see it's not far at all and it's me 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.660
 makes an incredible service render in 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.120
 chorus so if you missed that will 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.280
 a slightly more modern interface but 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.400
 it's the same principle 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.770
 you will choose from all 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:42.860
 precepts on same concept has dropped to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.570
 cmv four have clicked personalized and 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.150

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:57.110
 so 1280 by 720 main profile 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.869
 frame rate 59.94 lower edge 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 first one and especially bit rate 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.190
