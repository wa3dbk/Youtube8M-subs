00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:47.229
 pretty liquid thing at the start of the shot so 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.940
 you could be a little bit of 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.410

 here to avoid his strength he goes 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.330
 add a few drops of juice 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.340
 lemon made by men while 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.710
 simply 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.710
 here you mix that or she 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.410
 worries with thounois there that's it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.840
 walk all the cushions 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.570
 as there are two cereals oats barley 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.209
 all are shooting so here I am going 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.440
 add the flour with a blow like that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.220
 in one go bof bof me I add the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.799
 baking powder 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.970
 we will add apples just like 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:39.970
 like that really so here I have 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 mixed the mixture must be 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.290
 smooth but do not mix too much no 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.549
 more here and there we add more 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.820
 more fluffy with a little bit of 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.820
 melted butter 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.050
 the mixture becomes very bright 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.310
 game to be there without super good ok so 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.490
 we did the leg 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.440
 we will fill the molds you filled it 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.930
 three quarters the exact no ok here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.540
 well stocked me I pour it but it's the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:17.450
 jordan we will not redo the topping at 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.990
 owl are we sprinkling cereals 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.540
 per week very regularly and loose who 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.680
 is the top is that we will have a topping 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 super crispy evacuation because 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.240
 that before then 180 degrees I would say 15 to 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.590
 20 minutes depending on the size of the mussels 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.850
 you check cooking proof of a 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.810
 knife his fishing resources is that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.340
 it's cooked to any leak 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.080
 that's our 100 or so 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.910
 let cool on a rack and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.710
 unfortunately it will have to wait before 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.780
 to taste his best his best 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.760
 cold so this idea you can the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.620
 resume on muffins for example that 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.390
 works very well 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.160
 I tested also on cookies and 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.520
 in brownies where big bowls this 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.720
 top 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.720
 so now it's up to you
