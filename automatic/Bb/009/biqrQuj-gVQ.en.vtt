00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.100
 very good to all welcome to another 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.930
 corner was about that juan and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.180
 rider of death and let's start like 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.179
 always for the war cry you can 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.179
 smell the cowardice for them 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.630
 who has a gift but this one has 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 a little gift then there is not until 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.730
 our enemies have bitten the dust 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.530
 do not worry I'll leave the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.420
 shades 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.420
 and as cowards 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.770
 do not worry, christian, I'll leave you 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.770
 waves dancing 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.830
 and laughter 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 let's go to the spells 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 here we are seeing how the 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.850
 character and how is 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.950
 the high tax 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.540
 here we also see the passive 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.990
 we fight while cowards 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 the q 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.670
 the w 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.900
 we do not kneel before anyone 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.979
 again the e 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.659
 another q 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.909
 the w again 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.330
 you deserve what you get 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.360
 and the r 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.320
 let's go to the record the recovery is the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.320
 nobody's shield 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.630
 and finally death 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.140
 So far this corner is usually that 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 have liked and until the next video 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.340
