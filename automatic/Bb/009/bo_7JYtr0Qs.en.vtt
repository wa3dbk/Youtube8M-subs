 our mother zone that leaves the house 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.340
 imagine the kids will love me as 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.050
 I have a young child, always think of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.670
 something for a child, right? 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.130
 the film in Chile once again 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.920
 little house even brought her the male version 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 to see that the same person did the other 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.989
 The same way, now, connect my 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.250
 students talking about that kiss for her to 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.590
 does not kill me 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.170
 there we will do something more proper 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 small child and will ask for my 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.590
 friend's house will donate all the swimming is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.489
 Of course not for school books. 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.410
 hold on 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 but it's a backpack for kids that she 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.359
 Interracial, it made me very fast. 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.489
 back 30 of the window image and then thereafter 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.290
 that we show we enjoy 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.290
 follow you step-by-step 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.369
 in a super quiet without zipper looks good 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.689
 Here it is great because since my 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.250
 clothes that go to sleep in the house of a 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 little friend as a toy also in touch 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 a pet play me kofu how come 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.140
 If it keeps, it will take good care of us. 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.979
 use the carapinha fabric flame carapinha 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.900
 have come out that is the fabric that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.119
 sheep skin 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.610
 So we'll see, I'll show you a lot. 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.070
 how it was done and this is the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.869
 The reverse is his neighbor's fabric so I 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.299
 I'm going to use the little bump on my little body. 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.119
 outside and I will use the 100% cotton 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.460
 The same color can be any 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.920
 Thicker thinner can be raw cotton 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 is also more full-bodied than cotton 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.159
 when there he runs a lot in these 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.159
 fruits harvested 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.460
 today the mold is already there 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.300
 you could say on the site we're going to 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.590
 back to front is the same 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.350
 mold 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.280
 only the difference here or the part of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.959
 back 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.000
 he's a little bigger here one 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.010
 partition because of music 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.980
 he is so you put one on 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.200
 other he this much larger centimeter 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.630
 that it is a feeling that I felt a 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.420
 centimeter already I put a 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.190
 more or less does not pass either 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.170
 one centimeter decrease increase does not give 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.170
 much difference but sometimes the person 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.420
 can not print the template at home 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.190
 something like this then has a notion 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.790
 same year when he sends a Cherokee to 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.810
 pain may increase until this height is 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.730
 here 38 60 high by 22 and a half 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 take personal always asks me opposes the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.459
 but there I can not print 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.130
 takes one player and increases up to two 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.190
 sizes more or less right then this 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.570
 is the mold of the part of staying ahead 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.500
 this is the one in the back 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:26.370
 there is an arm to leg to ear 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:31.590
 the little heart front and the double head 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.120
 that arms we'll cut two 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.670
 Twice on right we go 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.190
 sew already cut in right over 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.079
 right to sewing sewing leaves after 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.940
 after sewing a tip here are you 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.519
 put a dot of machine number 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.670
 two in the case here until the end of line 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.640
 white that is better black and white 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.769
 the right size has appeared because 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.329
 putting the number 2 hours stretched 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.130
 other side it will not appear much 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.709
 according to the study in 80 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.910
 it holds another year after 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.150
 stitched 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.330
 then we close the seam well but 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.520
 do not need 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:21.530
 we'll do two is two leg 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.530
 two of the arm fill with silicone which is 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.160
 and has a detail that the leg we go 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.940
 fill up to a certain point you will 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.710
 leave 16 cm without filling and gives 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.040
 a few dots here to hold because 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.670
 She gets so fucked up the legs we 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.670
 Let's do this. 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:05:05.810
 arms can fill up almost on top 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:05:05.810
 of the head also in the same way above 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:06:16.310
 her head and then her head 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.310
 has a detail only 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.240
 the needle here only gives a blip not 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.730
 has no secret is because the little nose 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.440
 the sheep down here has the backpack 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.570
 You're mine, you see. 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.570
 detail of this painting she made in the 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.570
 little face is already there already had this fold 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.310
 Also very simple analyst of farm 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.070
 simple and I liked the proposal that 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:51.530
 Left right, right? 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:56.250
 I know the charm in the place of the arneiro 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:58.860
 bus organ and here 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.780
 underneath a neighbor here then no 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.300
 It's time to get the nose to the muscle crisis. 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.860
 here the ear is filled with 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.200
 little ear 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.900
 then you will put inside out with time 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.690
 because she's already right out. 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:16.850
 passes a seam around no seams 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:21.030
 leaves so natural and so do we 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:24.780
 paint inside it can pass the blush 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.220
 that anyone who wants to paint can 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.040
 stronger than plastic is 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.690
 delicate and gives less chance of error to 

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.660
 anyone who does not usually is not accustomed to 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.790
 fiddle with paint and give it to you and touch up 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.680
 then easily but not out, not because 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.680
 it's not a thing that will wash a lot right? 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:51.800
 this later 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:51.800
 so the dot that will deliver the na 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.500
 time to deliver the baby here 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.510
 so, it's ready for us 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:07.590

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:08.880
 child online patchwork 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.800
 Let's take a moment to 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.630
 Spirituality always at 3 o'clock has 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.550
 third of mercy and in the sequence 

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.470
 we saw back to complete this 

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.030
 super cute sadness backpack that goes
