00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:20.100
 The image of Leon this time is a cool tough guy in a word 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.360
 First, forward and backward capability is trained than in the bio-2 is the first as coolness set of appearance 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.250
 From the point of being high 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.250
 Has become to what type was also firmly 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.579
 President's daughter Ashley is a girl who wants to protect in a nutshell 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 It is a girl who can not fight for myself that is not in the series before 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 I can not do anything without Leo's protection 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.370
 I think that you are able to work together with Leon , rather than just getting stuck 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.760
 I will 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:54.969
 In a word this time seems not to be a zombie 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.570
 Enemy character called zombies and come hit in the group to use the weapon to the action believe the difference 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.130
 is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:06.440
 Think if there is a very strong and high impact enemy among them 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:10.420
 More than I thought I would try out the game with an experimental game in which an enemy with a chainsaw was made immediately 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.420
 There was a strong presence in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:28.140
 If ufo is set in the vast stage such as forest and village 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.850
 Many enemies appear due to group madness, and the player is in a fierce action studio 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.850
 We aimed at stage that we could do 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.920
 The stage this time that imaged medieval Europe 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.440
 In the atmosphere as if left behind in time 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.290
 It is a village or a small shrine ruled by a mysterious religious group 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 Aim for fear that one person has entered a place dominated by such a deviational culture 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 I am 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:06.070
 In addition, it is in the light of day that the time zone is daytime 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:11.440
 I think that has made an uncomfortable feeling panic Museum of the effect of being nonchalant attacked 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:17.410
 I think that the player's sense of presence has risen dramatically by the change of the point of view now 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 We also paid attention to connecting indoor and outdoor seamlessly 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:27.150
 Not only the appearance of appearance but also the game itself becomes active 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.150
 Speedy offense and defense can now be performed while maintaining a sense of tension 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.750
 This time even in real time in most events to eliminate the error with the game as much as possible 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 I used 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:47.420
 We have succeeded in connecting the game and the story without any sense of incongruity 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:54.310
 Leon bleeds through the glass of the car was set the other one body by Leon 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.310
 Special effects such as reflection use various other interesting methods 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:04.490
 Real-time but also facial animation and special effects 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:08.800
 More quality in that you are using barrage movie same number is compared with the existing barrage movie 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.800
 But it is finished in nothing inferior 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.860
 By purposely moving the character in the cut-off hall 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.960
 We are configured to make your picture better 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.250
 Character motions are not connected by man scene, but basically cut 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:36.780
 I use what was taken every 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.780
 We have put together what was originally three events on the director 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.380
 Each character target used is a character 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.610
 Exceeds 30 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.420
 All order to express the rich features of facial expressions this time 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.720
 Designer has created in with hand 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:05.010
 In addition, in order to add an expression, create a custom parameter for each character and work high 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.010
 Achieve efficiency 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.139
 Unlike previous biohazards, more than a dozen characters are shown in one scene 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.930
 I will 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.280
 Motion models are not one by one, but use basic models and motions. 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.260
 I will 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.480
 More by shifting the frame of motion and devising the arrangement of characters 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.480
 It looks like there is a character of 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:46.050
 A bottle of respect that tightens the neck of Leon and throws a cold 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:49.330
 I try to be strong and respected 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.430
 Where it hits the beam of the ceiling 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.400
 Basically, motion uses motion capture, but this cut uses it 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.479
 I have not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:06.849
 From the motion corresponding to the ceiling of the beam until it fall to the ground 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:10.210
 It was reproduced by motion so that there was no difference with other parts because 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:13.480
 Cut door knob twist 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.830
 Direction to bring out the power of respect 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:22.440
 Taking iron to bend most easily with a strong force 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.440
 It is built to be an impact cut 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:36.590
 In the event that a dog faces a giant, a skilled animator is based on the actual dog movement . 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:38.540
 Expressing the movement of a realistic dog despite being in a situation that can not be 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.990
 I will 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.350
 The entire camera layout motion fix 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:50.070
 use 3d software called xsi 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:56.280
 Writing uses in-house developed tools 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:59.030
 High working efficiency by using different functions of xsi and tools developed in-house 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.030
 Realized 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:10.130
 Huge creature ideas 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:12.990
 To some extent the basic enemy can be subjective to the camera was of bio-4 in the same size of the doll adopted close 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.230
 The enemy has become monotonous only 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.610
 So I tried to make the doll a huge size 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.610
 We adopted because it was good 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:40.360
 Ashley poses to look like a woman 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:46.200
 I was nervous on my finger 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:52.140
 I also studied how to actually shake the chest in the part that moves violently 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:54.180
 Adjust the camera to show salt and touch effectively to avoid becoming monotonous in a narrow passage 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:59.039
 doing 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:01.150
 We try to express Ashley's falling into the middle of nowhere with the timing when it comes out 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:08.190
 I will 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:08.190
 I made many adjustments so that the sense of tension was expressed in particular by the expressions of the two people
