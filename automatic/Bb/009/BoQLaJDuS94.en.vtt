00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
was just kind of an idea I was going to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.770 
was just kind of an idea I was going to
put<00:01:31.680> light<00:01:32.549> stone<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> shape<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> an

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
put light stone and like the shape of an

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
put light stone and like the shape of an
X<00:01:33.990> across<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.619> top<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.119> seeing

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
X across the top now it's just seeing

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.510 
X across the top now it's just seeing
like<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.290> look<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.189> not

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
like what it would look like this is not

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
like what it would look like this is not
going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.880> stay<00:01:39.090> don't<00:01:39.299> worry<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.619> up

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
going to stay don't worry but to get up

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.850 
going to stay don't worry but to get up
top<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.689> these<00:01:42.840> huge<00:01:43.170> pillars<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
top you go up on these huge pillars and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.240 
top you go up on these huge pillars and
the<00:01:44.790> stairs<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.710> uneven

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the stairs they're pretty like uneven

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.749 
the stairs they're pretty like uneven
and<00:01:48.770> what's<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> word<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.189> looking<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.460> like

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and what's the word I'm looking for like

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.330 
and what's the word I'm looking for like
Raggedy<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.570> guess<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.220> it's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
Raggedy I guess that I don't think it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
Raggedy I guess that I don't think it's
a<00:01:53.430> word<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.600> uneven<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
a word like just uneven and like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.039 
a word like just uneven and like
unproportional<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.820> guess<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.149> don't<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
unproportional I guess I don't know so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
unproportional I guess I don't know so
this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> why<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.710> needed<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.100> imprinted

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
this is why I needed those imprinted

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
this is why I needed those imprinted
torches<00:01:59.850> because<00:02:01.790> tons<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> torches<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.829> once

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
torches because tons of torches so once

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.880 
we originally had it named minecraft or
minecraft<00:05:24.780> because<00:05:25.780> we<00:05:26.050> thought<00:05:26.560> originally

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
minecraft because we thought originally

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.470

stuff but so here it is from this thing
what<00:06:19.690> kind<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.900> looks<00:06:20.050> like<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:20.260> leans<00:06:20.500> out<00:06:20.740> I

don't<00:06:22.360> know<00:06:22.480> why<00:06:22.630> that<00:06:22.660> might<00:06:22.930> just<00:06:23.080> be<00:06:23.200> me<00:06:23.470> but

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
don't know why that might just be me but

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.159 
don't know why that might just be me but
it<00:06:24.880> looks<00:06:25.060> really<00:06:25.270> nice<00:06:25.480> i<00:06:25.690> think<00:06:25.870> it<00:06:25.990> was<00:06:26.110> a

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
it looks really nice i think it was a

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.170 
it looks really nice i think it was a
cool<00:06:26.860> project<00:06:27.160> in<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.700> end

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
cool project in the end

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.460 
cool project in the end
and<00:06:28.270> it<00:06:28.419> was<00:06:28.690> worth<00:06:29.970> six<00:06:30.970> hours<00:06:31.419> no<00:06:31.930> wasn't

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
and it was worth six hours no wasn't

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.670 
and it was worth six hours no wasn't
that<00:06:32.650> much<00:06:32.830> oh<00:06:34.500> that<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.530> my<00:06:35.680> fealty<00:06:35.919> t<00:06:37.350> but<00:06:38.350> yeah
