00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because I've seen that most covergirl

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710 
because I've seen that most covergirl
foundations<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.909> come<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> pump

foundations don't come up with the pump

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
foundations don't come up with the pump
so<00:01:21.960> i'm<00:01:22.080> happy<00:01:22.320> they<00:01:22.590> stepped<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.220> their<00:01:23.400> game

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so i'm happy they stepped up their game

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.260 
so i'm happy they stepped up their game
and<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.930> mmm<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.729> comes<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.090> around

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and put that in mmm it comes in around

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
and put that in mmm it comes in around
10<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.570> 11<00:01:27.960> shades<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.619> don't<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.040> too<00:01:29.100> dark<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
10 or 11 shades they don't go too dark I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.920 
10 or 11 shades they don't go too dark I
think<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> darkest<00:01:30.329> one<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
think the darkest one is more of a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.560 
think the darkest one is more of a
tannish<00:01:31.290> color<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
tannish color and that's it so that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
tannish color and that's it so that
really<00:01:33.720> sucks<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.259> they<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
really sucks that they don't have that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
really sucks that they don't have that
many<00:01:35.340> shades<00:01:35.640> available<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.270> hopefully

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
many shades available but hopefully

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.940 
many shades available but hopefully
it'll<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.900> part<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> their<00:01:37.320> permanent<00:01:37.680> line

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it'll be part of their permanent line

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
it'll be part of their permanent line
and<00:01:38.310> they'll<00:01:38.549> bring<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.240> shades<00:01:39.630> um<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and they'll bring out more shades um I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
and they'll bring out more shades um I
have<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> say<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.899> impressed

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
have to say I'm really really impressed

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.520

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
would say it's a medium coverage it's

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.900 
would say it's a medium coverage it's
definitely<00:04:35.720> not<00:04:35.870> light<00:04:36.410> but<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.400> kind<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:37.820> a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
definitely not light but it is kind of a

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.210 
definitely not light but it is kind of a
medium<00:04:38.210> coverage<00:04:38.479> I'm<00:04:38.690> gonna<00:04:38.870> do<00:04:39.080> half<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:40.009> pump

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
medium coverage I'm gonna do half a pump

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.810 
medium coverage I'm gonna do half a pump
more<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.139> kind<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.500> cover<00:04:43.340> up<00:04:43.580> my

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
more just to kind of cover up my

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:55.779 
more just to kind of cover up my
problematic<00:04:44.539> areas

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.049 

okay<00:04:56.789> so<00:04:57.589> this<00:04:58.589> is<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.830> pump<00:04:59.219> and<00:04:59.399> a<00:04:59.459> half<00:04:59.699> and<00:04:59.999> I

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:00.059 
okay so this is a pump and a half and I

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.639 
okay so this is a pump and a half and I
feel<00:05:00.300> like<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.719> gives<00:05:00.869> a<00:05:01.110> really<00:05:01.199> nice

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:01.649

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
underneath my eyes just to kind of cover

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.510 
underneath my eyes just to kind of cover
conceal<00:05:09.749> you<00:05:10.050> can<00:05:10.199> still<00:05:10.439> see<00:05:10.649> some<00:05:11.369> of<00:05:11.429> my

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.279 
conceal you can still see some of my
dark<00:05:11.909> under<00:05:12.779> eye<00:05:12.809> circles<00:05:13.999> so<00:05:15.289> depending<00:05:16.289> on

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
dark under eye circles so depending on

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.439 
dark under eye circles so depending on
what<00:05:16.649> flaws<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.219> have<00:05:17.399> that's<00:05:17.759> gonna<00:05:18.089> depend

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
what flaws you have that's gonna depend

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.899 
what flaws you have that's gonna depend
on<00:05:18.779> how<00:05:18.959> much<00:05:19.800> coverage<00:05:20.099> you're<00:05:20.550> gonna<00:05:20.669> need

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
on how much coverage you're gonna need

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.749 
on how much coverage you're gonna need
with<00:05:21.119> this<00:05:21.979> but<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.009> think<00:05:23.069> for<00:05:23.369> a<00:05:23.399> pump<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:23.699> a

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
with this but I think for a pump and a

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.279 
with this but I think for a pump and a
half<00:05:23.909> that's<00:05:24.089> pretty<00:05:24.389> good<00:05:24.599> the<00:05:25.110> way<00:05:25.259> it

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
half that's pretty good the way it

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.459 
half that's pretty good the way it
covered<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.069> looks<00:05:26.219> really<00:05:26.279> natural<00:05:26.699> and

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
covered and it looks really natural and

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.980 
covered and it looks really natural and
it<00:05:28.469> doesn't<00:05:28.769> feel<00:05:28.800> sticky<00:05:29.490> at<00:05:29.699> all<00:05:29.849> like<00:05:30.839> it's

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
it doesn't feel sticky at all like it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.779 
it doesn't feel sticky at all like it's
still<00:05:31.229> drawing<00:05:31.499> but<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.159> doesn't<00:05:32.519> have<00:05:32.729> that

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
still drawing but it doesn't have that

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.329 
still drawing but it doesn't have that
really<00:05:33.439> super<00:05:34.439> sticky<00:05:34.800> feel<00:05:34.979> to<00:05:35.129> it<00:05:35.159> or

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339
