00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.530
 good morning, we all found a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.750
 Sunday more in black and decker we are 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 with luma and we will present a brush 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 electric professional line and it's 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.150
 so so good days are good 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.590
 days we will all go to present 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.330
 the black and decker electric brush 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.769
 of the professional line the model s 750 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.539
 I guess this tool 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.039
 will use many carpenters and me 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.040
 I would like to know for what kind of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.989
 wood serves good this as you name it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 you come for carpenter is used more in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 Masisa wood had to function as 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.750
 the same tool is to eat material or 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 eat wood in different millimeters 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.629
 let's also go on to explain since 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 we are the tool in terms of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.480
 handle is coated by 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.399
 gomÃ  that helps us grip 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.960
 of the tool also has a 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.089
 switch that allows us to leave the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 operating machine and trigger 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.229
 that all the brushes are 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.329
 we also have a knob on this side 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.399
 that helps us direct the dust or 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.320
 be it for the left or for the right 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.600
 and also what the machine allows us 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.159
 that you see here is to regulate the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.170
 number of millimeters that is eating 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.549
 the material where we are working and 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 could you tell us how the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.289
 tool very well to work this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.750
 tool what you use are two blades 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.460
 reversible what they allow as well 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 we name the work of the machine to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 eat the millimeters that one gives to the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 machine will be working the wood 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.690
 It also has an aluminum shoe yes 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 that helps us support this shoe for 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.440
 go eating the different materials 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.640
 material that we are working against 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.560
 of some slots that can be 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 observe that they help us to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 position ourselves within what is the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.959
 songs of the materials was giving him 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.299
 shape according to us we want very well 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.310
 what do you think about them and now we're going to 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.310
 see how the perfect tool works 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.730
 good 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.940
 we just saw how the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.040
 tool and I think it's worth noting 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.110
 which is a very powerful tool I do not know 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.090
 what do you have to tell us about this good 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.610
 I can emphasize that it has a powerful 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.310
 engine that allows us to work 750 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.530
 watts and that a speed from 1500 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.880
 revolutions per minute this allows us 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.680
 develop correctly in the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.150
 materials that we have seen how it works 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.370
 I would like the tool too 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.350
 highlight the security cap that has 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 this helps us as it is a tool 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.470
 that works with continuous speed up 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.150
 that when we stop working the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.760
 trigger the engine keeps turning and the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.440
 blade therefore we also support the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.970
 tool quickly and it's not going to 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.860
 allow that encourage the material that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.800
 we are working assures us a 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.390
 comfortable work fast and continuous and 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.430
 tell us how is that of the blades 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.430
 reversible good from the spoons 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.320
 reversible that has two yes that are of 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.390
 tungsten carbide what do these 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.000
 blades is that you can change a 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.650
 once you give it the use it has and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.430
 You can have a new blade again 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.469
 what I clarify is that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.000
 this goat of you does not allow us to 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.310
 us that the material is much more 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.689
 strong that does not wear out compared to 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.040
 with other services that have blades 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.650
 normal this is going to give a greater 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.239
 performance of the tool already 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.449
 long time will be good much 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.370
 more and much better for the user 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.050
 perfect numa now tell us all 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.460
 where can we get this tool 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.870
