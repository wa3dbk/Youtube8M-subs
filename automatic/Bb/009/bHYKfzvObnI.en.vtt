were trying to build something at cheap

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.830 
were trying to build something at cheap
as<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.700> could<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.090> hopefully<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.570> would<00:00:12.660> be

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
as we could and hopefully it would be

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.980 
as we could and hopefully it would be
competitive<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.650> short<00:00:13.950> drive<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.690> so<00:00:15.690> far

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
competitive on a short drive and so far

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.700 
competitive on a short drive and so far
from<00:00:16.410> Tony's<00:00:16.949> feedback<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.789> gods<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.390> bag<00:00:18.710> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
from Tony's feedback and gods to bag it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.000 
from Tony's feedback and gods to bag it
looks<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.039> it'll<00:00:20.279> do<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.270> thought<00:00:21.480> we'd

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010

working on this project what I bring to
the<00:00:54.149> project<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.890> familiarity<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the project is some familiarity with the

LS engine barking ability and that first

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.830 
LS engine barking ability and that first
hand<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:02.430> sent<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:03.510> passed

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840

around<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.739> me<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.220> Phillip

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
around that make me look that Phillip

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.630 
around that make me look that Phillip
aircraft<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.540> thing<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.430> struck<00:01:08.430> me

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
aircraft that's the thing that struck me

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.880 
aircraft that's the thing that struck me
is<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.380> first<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> long<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.700> got

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
is the first time a long time you got

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.550 
is the first time a long time you got
basically<00:01:13.890> meets<00:01:14.190> a<00:01:15.229> significant<00:01:16.229> number<00:01:16.260> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
basically meets a significant number of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.060 
basically meets a significant number of
the<00:01:17.190> criteria<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.070> sprint

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the criteria that you want for a sprint

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
the criteria that you want for a sprint
car<00:01:20.250> motor<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.000> light<00:01:21.300> enough<00:01:21.330> weight<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
car motor it's light enough weight this

standard<00:01:24.450> 48<00:01:25.050> pounds<00:01:25.290> i<00:01:25.890> believe<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
standard 48 pounds i believe so it can

with an ally block and implement heads

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.430 
with an ally block and implement heads
and<00:01:30.660> it's<00:01:31.380> got<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> power<00:01:33.000> potential<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:34.290> make

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
and it's got the power potential to make

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400 
and it's got the power potential to make
decent<00:01:34.890> power<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.910> fort<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.660> work<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.380> a

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
oil pump on the cam but why I thought

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.710 
oil pump on the cam but why I thought
about<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.169> rain<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.060> part<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.360> us<00:05:18.449> have

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
about the rain so that part of us have

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.800 
about the rain so that part of us have
fairly<00:05:18.960> familiar<00:05:19.169> taught<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.810> basically

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
fairly familiar taught you and basically

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.460 
fairly familiar taught you and basically
you<00:05:22.650> know<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:22.889> motor<00:05:23.430> will<00:05:23.940> hold<00:05:24.750> into<00:05:25.440> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
you know the motor will hold into a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.360 
you know the motor will hold into a
permit<00:05:26.370> card<00:05:26.690> with<00:05:27.690> no<00:05:27.720> modifications<00:05:28.440> car

motor plate to be used you have

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.350 
motor plate to be used you have

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
those awesome at 9am thousands use it so

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.580 
those awesome at 9am thousands use it so
there's<00:05:58.200> a<00:05:58.229> lot<00:05:58.320> of<00:05:58.380> options<00:05:58.800> there<00:05:58.919> so<00:06:00.590> the
