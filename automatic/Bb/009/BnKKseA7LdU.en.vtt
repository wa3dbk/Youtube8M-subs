00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.920
 we reworked all the decoration 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.690
 of sport and we wanted a place that 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
 at the height of valmont and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.039
 dying we worked on colors 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.780
 very sweet very soothing because before 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.490
 everything is there for a moment of relaxation 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.200
 we also worked on the area 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.360
 welcome who for us was very very 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.920
 important to have when you arrive 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.379
 to have the hostesses just standing close 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 to point you to the areas of 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.989
 rest the locker areas and the area 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.989
 cabin 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.880
 the goal was to create the link 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.340
 between the German products that had 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.620
 their own identity and then the hotel the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.320
 parisian palace die puts so we have 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.160
 worked on curved lines that 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.790
 allowed to have a very soft universe 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.280
 very very enveloping to be able to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.940
 to allow customers to meet 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 in quiet peaceful worlds with 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.560
 so flew away from butterflies and then 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.990
 this material work on the walls that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 was pretty interesting in spaces 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.119
 where we find both the cabins of 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.159
 care so we can find all the 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 German prodigy care a space 2 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.149
 two steam rooms with the sauna and then a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.000
 area a little rest there when a jump final 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:42.160
 mans 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.290
 we can wait for his appointment very 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.810
 very quietly very peacefully 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 in this species I mean it's 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.729
 this kind a little cocoon 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.260
 no 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 how
