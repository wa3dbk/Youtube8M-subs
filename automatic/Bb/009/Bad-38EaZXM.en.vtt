00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.720
 e re 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.480
 Say 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:15.959
 Continue Tomica Number Grand Pi inflammation 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.850
 86 Torre Roh amazing is strong I rainy day dream Tomica say the in-game winning streak 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:23.190
 Say really about this matter yet and he strong to pass 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.510
 I will try this time 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:32.260
 Subaru Forester 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:34.980
 Nde no I enemy is in quite 86 is also doing what the other to go in this weight class of Forrester 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 I would like 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.960
 Sense of weight 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.739
 There is a certain amount of weight, too. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.860
 The idiot is an idiot who opens behind 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:58.879
 I will open with Paka back This also corresponds from normal to love from Subaru and Leicester 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:04.839
 Will the challenger win this time? 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.839
 After all Tomica raises a slender challenger's tripper 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.060
 Launched 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.050
 I'm afraid to tell you 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.130
 I refused all of 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.130
 Stable force 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.640
 Be it after all I 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.609
 I 'll slide with that sonar 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.090
 Transfer normal to now and now 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.909
 But the power with Prop 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.969
 I think it's boring 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.999
 Is this 86 being chased 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.999
 Oh 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.330
 Had to bite was sorry Huh 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.140
 Live in a AAH June here one more time 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.140
 The 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:12.670
 Yes Forrester in really feeling good now had become to feel like chasing 86 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.930
 But this weight is a disaster 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:23.079
 First of all, here as a little example 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:26.260
 In addition we score in such a chocolate from last here positive Come and here I'd seen the first time of tea 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:29.050
 If you have it, 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.850
 86 is one one 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.650
 I am out of course 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:44.200
 It's like this kind of feeling and it's finally unbeatable 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.200
 It was a victory of 86. This time I was quite excited tt 1 was a great deal
