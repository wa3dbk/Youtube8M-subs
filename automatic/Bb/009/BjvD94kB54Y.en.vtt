00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.170 
some Russian guy driving it's like I
have<00:03:48.519> Cameron<00:03:49.030> from<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.359> car<00:03:49.709> ready<00:03:50.879> but<00:03:51.879> just

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
have Cameron from the car ready but just

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:12.470 
have Cameron from the car ready but just
these<00:03:52.329> kind<00:03:52.659> of<00:03:52.750> moments

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.340 

I<00:04:12.680> think<00:04:13.819> what<00:04:14.819> is<00:04:15.000> exactly<00:04:15.420> how<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> thought<00:04:16.079> it

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
I think what is exactly how I thought it

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.159 
I think what is exactly how I thought it
would<00:04:16.500> happen

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
would happen

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.420 
would happen
basically<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.440> French<00:04:19.680> had<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.040> initial

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
basically the French had the initial

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.840 
basically the French had the initial
advantage<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.120> then<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.329> soon<00:04:21.540> as<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.850> as

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
advantage and then as soon as the as

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.210 
advantage and then as soon as the as
soon<00:04:24.030> as<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.210> became<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.600> gun<00:04:24.900> fight<00:04:25.199> the<00:04:25.860> French

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
soon as it became a gun fight the French

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:41.350 
soon as it became a gun fight the French
didn't<00:04:26.699> stand<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:27.030> chance<00:04:27.229> so<00:04:28.760> good<00:04:29.760> stuff

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.499
