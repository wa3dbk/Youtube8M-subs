something like two hours of grenade
explosions<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.610> get<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.750> he<00:02:28.230> just

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
explosions to get it right and he just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.890 
explosions to get it right and he just
does<00:02:28.590> turn<00:02:28.769> ready<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.340> me<00:02:31.519> well<00:02:32.519> let's<00:02:33.450> move<00:02:33.629> to

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
does turn ready to me well let's move to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
does turn ready to me well let's move to
another<00:02:34.410> part<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.890> demonstration<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.640> was

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
another part of the demonstration I was

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.809 
another part of the demonstration I was
mentioning<00:02:36.000> vehicles<00:02:36.660> ARMA<00:02:37.500> 3<00:02:37.739> will<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.099> about

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
mentioning vehicles ARMA 3 will be about

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.470 
mentioning vehicles ARMA 3 will be about
the<00:02:38.940> vehicles<00:02:39.330> as<00:02:39.420> well<00:02:39.660> aircraft<00:02:40.440> boats

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the vehicles as well aircraft boats

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.080 
the vehicles as well aircraft boats
helicopters<00:02:43.310> cars<00:02:44.310> tanks<00:02:46.459> this<00:02:47.459> all<00:02:47.730> will<00:02:47.910> get

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
helicopters cars tanks this all will get

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.250 
helicopters cars tanks this all will get
their<00:02:48.390> proper<00:02:48.780> simulation<00:02:50.120> first<00:02:51.260> let's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
their proper simulation first let's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
their proper simulation first let's
check<00:02:52.410> out<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> detail<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.280> interior<00:02:53.670> it's

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
check out the detail the interior it's

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.140 
check out the detail the interior it's
amazing<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.890> gouges<00:02:56.310> all<00:02:56.640> stop

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
amazing right all the gouges all stop

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.210 
amazing right all the gouges all stop
there<00:02:57.989> almost<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> racing<00:02:59.190> game

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
there almost as a racing game

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.339 
there almost as a racing game
unfortunately<00:02:59.819> I<00:03:00.180> can't<00:03:00.629> show<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.079> picture

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
unfortunately I can't show you a picture

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.020 
unfortunately I can't show you a picture
in<00:03:01.560> picture<00:03:01.769> at<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.310> moment<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:02.940> are

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
in picture at the moment but we are

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.910 
in picture at the moment but we are
working<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.840> now<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:06.180> first<00:03:06.480> advance

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
working on it and now the first advance

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.559 
working on it and now the first advance
to<00:03:07.920> implement<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.790> physics<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.360> our<00:03:09.450> engine

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
to implement the physics to our engine

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.740 
to implement the physics to our engine
it's<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.230> bad<00:03:11.439> although<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.730> not<00:03:13.000> entirely

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
it's the bad although it's not entirely

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.970 
it's the bad although it's not entirely
physically<00:03:14.290> part<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:16.450> work<00:03:16.659> on<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.860> can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
physically part we do work on it you can

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.360 
physically part we do work on it you can
also<00:03:18.099> push<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.659> car<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:20.829> may<00:03:20.980> even<00:03:21.220> try

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
also push the car you may even try

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.369 
also push the car you may even try
pushing<00:03:21.670> heavier<00:03:22.150> objects<00:03:22.829> by<00:03:23.829> this<00:03:25.379> which

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
pushing heavier objects by this which

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.920 
pushing heavier objects by this which
takes<00:03:26.680> some<00:03:26.769> effort<00:03:27.090> anyway<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.599> thanks

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
takes some effort anyway we have thanks

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.729 
takes some effort anyway we have thanks
for<00:03:29.079> this<00:03:30.810> you

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
for this you

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.860 
for this you
if<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.189> want<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.430> destroy<00:03:34.790> stuff<00:03:34.849> or<00:03:35.359> do<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
if you want to destroy stuff or do the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.680 
if you want to destroy stuff or do the
other<00:03:36.019> things<00:03:36.349> you<00:03:37.280> can<00:03:37.459> use<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.760> time

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.330 

why<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.320> one<00:03:44.210> yeah

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.220 

besides<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> physics<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.630> also<00:03:54.780> trying

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
besides the physics we are also trying

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.330 
besides the physics we are also trying
to<00:03:56.690> improve<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> performance<00:03:58.190> increase<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to improve the performance increase the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.740 
to improve the performance increase the
view<00:03:59.489> distance<00:04:00.709> just<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.800> show<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
view distance just to show the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.380 
view distance just to show the
environment<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.930> have<00:04:04.080> I<00:04:04.640> don't<00:04:05.640> know<00:04:05.730> light

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
environment we have I don't know light

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.900 
environment we have I don't know light
of<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.630> engines<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:08.430> Comanche

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
of the engines of the Comanche

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.130 
of the engines of the Comanche
helicopter<00:04:09.709> which<00:04:10.709> fortunately<00:04:11.900> was<00:04:12.900> not

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
helicopter which fortunately was not

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.670 
helicopter which fortunately was not
cancelled<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.830> our<00:04:14.250> universe<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.120> armourers

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
cancelled in our universe the armourers

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.750 
cancelled in our universe the armourers
so<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.220> now<00:04:17.310> enjoy<00:04:17.519> flying<00:04:18.030> it
