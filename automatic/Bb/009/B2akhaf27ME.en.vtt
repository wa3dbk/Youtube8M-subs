00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.080
 other measures with his motorcycles for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.549
 better analyze their behavior before 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 to hit the road to see their 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.530
 comfort has returned to the capital and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.660

 to cardan it's the new gs that is 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.849
 place on the highest step of the podium 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.159

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.840
 very good workmanship on the road 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.010
 behind the month gs that three machines 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.359

 rewarding welcome sophisticated pulls 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.790
 its pin of the game thanks to its engine v4 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.849
 and its transmission system 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.250
 automatic braking combined breakage 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.200
 of efficiency despite its imposing size 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.659
 and its consequent weight the maxi trail

 ponda moves with serenity on the 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.239
 small winding roads and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.950

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.269
 however far less effective than the

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.120

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.560
 however less impressive than his 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.930
 rivals but she has many 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.790
 qualities on the atypical dynamic level 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.799
 by its design its equipment 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.630

 last of our ranking 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.289
 penalized by its engine and its lack 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.669
 of agility this is briefly what we 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.590
