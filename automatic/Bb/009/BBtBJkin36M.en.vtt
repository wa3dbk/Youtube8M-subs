was going to do a squad deathmatch on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
Vietnam but there was only one Vietnam

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.470 
Vietnam but there was only one Vietnam
server<00:00:31.009> that<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> could<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.850> had<00:00:33.030> anyone

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
server that I could see that had anyone

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.900 
server that I could see that had anyone
in<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.040> located<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
in it at all and it was located in the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.220 
in it at all and it was located in the
Netherlands<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.630> there<00:00:36.719> were<00:00:36.780> only<00:00:36.930> two

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
Netherlands and there were only two

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.670 
Netherlands and there were only two
people<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> server<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:39.390> decided<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.140> not

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
people on the server so i decided to not

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.369 
people on the server so i decided to not
do<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.719> it<00:00:42.719> probably<00:00:42.899> would<00:00:43.230> not

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
do that because it probably would not

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
do that because it probably would not
have<00:00:43.440> been<00:00:43.710> very<00:00:44.180> interesting<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.450> are

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have been very interesting and there are

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
have been very interesting and there are
only<00:00:45.570> five<00:00:46.050> kids<00:00:46.710> left<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.579> match<00:00:48.739> for<00:00:49.739> my

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
only five kids left in this match for my

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.360 
only five kids left in this match for my
team<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.000> left<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
team but there's only one left the

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.069 
team but there's only one left the
leading<00:00:53.370> team<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.210> we're<00:00:54.449> probably<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.930> going

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
leading team so we're probably not going

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
leading team so we're probably not going
to<00:00:55.170> win<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:57.649> Wow<00:00:58.910> but<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.270> win<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
to win this Wow but if we do win this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.110 
to win this Wow but if we do win this
it'll<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> shortest<00:01:01.859> live<00:01:02.370> commentary<00:01:03.000> i

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it'll be the shortest live commentary i

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.399 
it'll be the shortest live commentary i
will<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> ever<00:01:03.809> done<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.650> won

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409

will have ever done we're actually won
all<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:08.330> at<00:01:09.330> least<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.049> be

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
all right at least I think it would be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
all right at least I think it would be
I'm<00:01:12.030> getting<00:01:12.299> awfully<00:01:12.720> close<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> level

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I'm getting awfully close to that level

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
I'm getting awfully close to that level
50<00:01:14.670> mark<00:01:15.350> getting<00:01:16.350> kind<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> excited<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
50 mark getting kind of excited about it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
idea why the kill limit would be set to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.490 
idea why the kill limit would be set to
57<00:02:15.910> kills<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.510> seems<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> very<00:02:16.990> random

kill limit has dyslexia and they wanted

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.990 
kill limit has dyslexia and they wanted
it<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.459> be<00:02:24.610> 75<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:26.709> quite<00:02:26.980> sure<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.430> very

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it to be 75 not quite sure on that very

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
it to be 75 not quite sure on that very
strange<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:29.380> my<00:02:29.739> opinion<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:31.320> does<00:02:32.320> mean<00:02:32.560> that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
strange in my opinion but does mean that

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
strange in my opinion but does mean that
we<00:02:32.860> still<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> chance<00:02:33.459> at<00:02:33.640> winning<00:02:33.850> this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
