00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
if you roll this up because it is a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.070 
if you roll this up because it is a

can actually remove the lower half of
the<00:03:37.030> sleeves<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:38.320> guess<00:03:38.860> if<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.130> super<00:03:39.430> hot

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580

you have to know that when you do that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.440 
you have to know that when you do that
you're<00:03:46.630> going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.080> zipping<00:03:47.440> off<00:03:47.709> your

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
but when it takes any kind of impact it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.620 
but when it takes any kind of impact it
stiffens<00:04:09.430> up<00:04:09.580> gives<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.090> really<00:04:10.330> great

annoying<00:04:42.249> or<00:04:42.550> intrusive<00:04:44.219> it<00:04:45.219> does<00:04:45.399> make<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.729> a

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
annoying or intrusive it does make it a

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.119 
annoying or intrusive it does make it a
little<00:04:45.819> bit<00:04:46.059> tighter<00:04:46.240> on<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.539> shoulders<00:04:47.129> but

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 
little bit tighter on the shoulders but

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.529 
little bit tighter on the shoulders but
not<00:04:48.339> uncomfortable<00:04:48.999> so<00:04:49.149> that's<00:04:49.330> something

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
not uncomfortable so that's something

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.570 
not uncomfortable so that's something
that's<00:04:49.779> new<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:50.439> think<00:04:50.889> they<00:04:50.949> eliminated<00:04:51.430> some

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's new I think they eliminated some

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
that's new I think they eliminated some
of<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.789> like<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:52.029> teepee<00:04:52.509> the<00:04:52.869> teepee<00:04:52.990> RS<00:04:53.649> the

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
of the like the teepee the teepee RS the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.980 
of the like the teepee the teepee RS the

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
thermoplastic rubbers rubber pieces that

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.600 
thermoplastic rubbers rubber pieces that
they<00:04:56.050> had<00:04:56.199> on<00:04:56.319> the<00:04:56.409> old<00:04:56.559> one<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.009> think<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.520> was

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
they had on the old one I think it was

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.219 
they had on the old one I think it was
one<00:04:57.729> on<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:57.879> back<00:04:58.059> of<00:04:58.089> marsh<00:04:58.509> that's<00:04:58.839> all<00:04:59.050> gone

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
one on the back of marsh that's all gone

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.529 
one on the back of marsh that's all gone
now<00:04:59.289> they<00:05:00.219> kind<00:05:00.430> of<00:05:00.460> simplified<00:05:01.089> the<00:05:01.240> design

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
now they kind of simplified the design

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.269 
now they kind of simplified the design
but<00:05:01.839> they<00:05:01.930> did<00:05:02.080> add<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.289> better<00:05:02.589> protection

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
but they did add the better protection

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:06.689 
but they did add the better protection
