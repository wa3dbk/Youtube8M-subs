00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
falling damage unlike most of the other

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
falling damage unlike most of the other
mounts<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> yeah<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:04.710> cool<00:01:05.100> also

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you're riding a pig run now it's fly

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.050 
you're riding a pig run now it's fly
time<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.770> course<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> limited<00:01:08.310> once<00:01:08.729> again

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
time of course is limited once again

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
time of course is limited once again
we'll<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.810> cool<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> was<00:01:10.350> actually

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
we'll be cool if it was actually

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
we'll be cool if it was actually
extended<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.610> wings<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> stuff<00:01:12.180> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
extended by your wings and stuff but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.020 
extended by your wings and stuff but
it's<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> mount<00:01:14.130> that's<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.610> well

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's actually a mount that's just well

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's actually a mount that's just well
I'd<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> end<00:01:15.930> game<00:01:16.080> mount<00:01:16.320> also

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I'd say this is the end game mount also

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.190 
I'd say this is the end game mount also
it's<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> hardest<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.900> does<00:01:19.049> make

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's the hardest to get so it does make

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
it's the hardest to get so it does make
a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.439> sense<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.159> yeah<00:01:20.280> it's<00:01:20.460> fast<00:01:20.700> it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
a lot of sense but yeah it's fast it's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.179 
a lot of sense but yeah it's fast it's
fast<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> ground<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:21.960> well<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.979> doesn't

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
fast in the ground which well it doesn't

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.380 
fast in the ground which well it doesn't
press<00:01:23.400> me<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.700> actually<00:01:23.939> faster<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
press me it's actually faster than the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.429 
press me it's actually faster than the
bunny<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.630> stuff<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
bunny and stuff like that look at this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
bunny and stuff like that look at this
look<00:01:25.700> at<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.939> zipping<00:01:27.420> around<00:01:27.509> like

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
look at him just zipping around like
