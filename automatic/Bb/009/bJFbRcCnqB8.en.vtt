00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
detection / security program and I'm

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.929 
detection / security program and I'm
just<00:00:28.679> gonna<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.189> into<00:00:29.399> this<00:00:29.579> terminal

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
to show you how it works and I called
the<00:00:32.579> program<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> test<00:00:33.269> so<00:00:33.570> type<00:00:34.109> in<00:00:34.260> test<00:00:34.500> and

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
sort of a a very rough map of my house

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.410 
sort of a a very rough map of my house
and<00:01:11.690> in<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:13.050> top<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.730> see<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and in the top right you can see the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850 
and in the top right you can see the
date<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.630> time<00:01:15.870> when<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> program<00:01:16.500> started

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
date and time when the program started

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
date and time when the program started
which<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.160> important<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.450> can

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
which is important because as you can

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.410 
which is important because as you can
see<00:01:18.660> in<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:18.960> middle<00:01:20.000> there's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> counter

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
see in the middle there's a counter

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
see in the middle there's a counter
going<00:01:21.660> on<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> tells<00:01:22.410> you<00:01:22.560> how<00:01:22.680> long<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
going on and that tells you how long the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.860 
going on and that tells you how long the
program<00:01:23.070> program<00:01:23.730> is<00:01:23.790> being<00:01:23.940> on<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> now

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
program program is being on for and now

the time that it was hit record the time

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.500 
the time that it was hit record the time
from<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.190> bit<00:01:44.400> here<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> says<00:01:44.910> time<00:01:45.180> since

from this bit here it says time since

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.890 
from this bit here it says time since

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
program was started and then using the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.660 
program was started and then using the
tie-in<00:01:49.410> using<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> date<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.250> time<00:01:50.310> will

tie-in using the date and the time will

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.540 
tie-in using the date and the time will
top<00:01:50.820> right<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> work<00:01:51.570> out<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.020> your

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
top right you can work out when your

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.460 
top right you can work out when your
intruder<00:01:53.550> decided<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.420> enter<00:01:54.720> your<00:01:54.870> house<00:01:55.080> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
intruder decided to enter your house and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.470 
intruder decided to enter your house and
I<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.760> this<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.940> gonna<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.120> particularly

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
I think this is gonna be particularly

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.320 
I think this is gonna be particularly
useful<00:01:57.660> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.230> want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.440> use<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> in

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
useful if you want to use that is in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.120 
useful if you want to use that is in
multiplayer<00:02:00.330> servers<00:02:00.900> because<00:02:01.650> you<00:02:01.950> know

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
multiplayer servers because you know

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880 
multiplayer servers because you know
people<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> grief<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.450> stuff<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.170> maybe

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
people can grief and stuff and maybe

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
people can grief and stuff and maybe
you've<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.850> chests<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.480> haven't<00:02:06.690> got<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you've got chests that you haven't got a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.779 
you've got chests that you haven't got a
lock<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.440> Nick<00:02:07.680> something<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.490> like

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
lock on and they Nick something but like

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
lock on and they Nick something but like
if<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.210> me<00:02:09.420> forget<00:02:09.869> everything<00:02:10.200> that's

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
if you like me forget everything that's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
if you like me forget everything that's
in<00:02:10.410> your<00:02:10.440> chests<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.920> they<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.190> aware<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
in your chests and they get aware of it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.170 
in your chests and they get aware of it
and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.160 
and
so<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.329> can<00:02:12.450> tell<00:02:12.599> they've<00:02:12.810> been<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.049> your

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
house so I'm just gonna demonstrate the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.059 
house so I'm just gonna demonstrate the
system<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.980> come<00:02:17.189> out<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.489> my<00:02:17.810> little<00:02:18.810> their

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
system and come out of my little their

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.610 
system and come out of my little their
clothes<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.250> secret<00:02:20.579> entrance<00:02:21.260> some<00:02:22.260> awesome

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
clothes the secret entrance some awesome

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.149 
clothes the secret entrance some awesome
piston<00:02:22.950> doors<00:02:23.129> there<00:02:24.349> so<00:02:25.349> if<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.709> step<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.069> this

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
piston doors there so if I step on this

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.580 
piston doors there so if I step on this
pressure<00:02:26.370> plate<00:02:26.489> here<00:02:27.049> it<00:02:28.049> should<00:02:28.170> activate

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
pressure plate here it should activate

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.839 
pressure plate here it should activate
it<00:02:30.500> go<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.829> one<00:02:32.010> here<00:02:32.900> stand<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.849> one

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
it go on this one here stand on that one

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.059 
it go on this one here stand on that one
here<00:02:36.120> stand<00:02:37.019> on<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:38.930> one<00:02:39.930> here<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:42.120> one

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
here stand on that and one here that one

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.789 
here stand on that and one here that one
okay<00:02:44.690> now<00:02:45.690> go<00:02:45.989> back<00:02:46.230> down<00:02:48.319> drop<00:02:49.319> back<00:02:49.470> down<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
okay now go back down drop back down to

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.399 
okay now go back down drop back down to
my<00:02:49.920> lair<00:02:52.760> here<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.090> see<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.659> was<00:02:54.900> recorded

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
my lair here you can see it was recorded

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.819 
my lair here you can see it was recorded
each<00:02:55.650> time<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.220> stepped<00:02:56.519> on<00:02:56.670> them<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.829> quite

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
each time I stepped on them and quite

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.039 
each time I stepped on them and quite
close<00:02:59.040> apart<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.579> can<00:02:59.700> see<00:02:59.879> so<00:03:00.180> that's

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
close apart as you can see so that's

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.770 
close apart as you can see so that's
pretty<00:03:01.319> cool

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
pretty cool

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.929 
pretty cool
I'm<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:03.930> put<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> code<00:03:05.159> for<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.430> program

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
I'm gonna put the code for this program

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.990 
I'm gonna put the code for this program
in<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.209> description<00:03:06.359> below<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.939> I<00:03:08.939> will

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
in the description below and I will

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.550 
in the description below and I will
quickly<00:03:09.389> show<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.959> code<00:03:10.139> but<00:03:10.379> I'm<00:03:10.470> not

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
quickly show you the code but I'm not

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.039 
quickly show you the code but I'm not
gonna<00:03:10.709> usually<00:03:11.159> explain<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.480> each<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
gonna usually explain to you each and

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.839 
gonna usually explain to you each and
every<00:03:13.290> step<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> way<00:03:13.920> because<00:03:14.189> it<00:03:14.609> would

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
every step of the way because it would

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.879 
every step of the way because it would
take<00:03:15.090> forever<00:03:15.389> because<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.199> haven't<00:03:16.470> used<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
take forever because I haven't used a

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.670 
take forever because I haven't used a
raise<00:03:17.069> which<00:03:17.849> I<00:03:17.970> probably<00:03:18.120> should<00:03:18.389> have<00:03:18.480> done

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
raise which I probably should have done

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.640 
raise which I probably should have done
so<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:20.010> gonna<00:03:20.250> take<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.489> longer<00:03:21.299> time<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:22.349> I<00:03:22.379> go

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
so it's gonna take a longer time so I go

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.869 
so it's gonna take a longer time so I go
I'll<00:03:23.099> see<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.430> desktop<00:03:23.760> quickly<00:03:25.879> welcome

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
I'll see you in desktop quickly welcome

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.479 
I'll see you in desktop quickly welcome
back<00:03:27.060> here<00:03:27.659> is<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.079> code<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.310> pretty

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
back here is the code and it's a pretty

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.949 
back here is the code and it's a pretty
long<00:03:29.730> piece<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.150> code<00:03:30.329> because<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.659> didn't<00:03:30.930> use

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
long piece of code because I didn't use

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.839 
long piece of code because I didn't use
arrays<00:03:31.409> which<00:03:31.829> was<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> bit<00:03:32.250> silly<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:32.669> our

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
arrays which was a bit silly but our

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.909 
arrays which was a bit silly but our
well<00:03:33.030> doesn't<00:03:33.840> mean<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.169> sir<00:03:34.349> I've<00:03:34.590> got<00:03:34.739> the

well doesn't mean that sir I've got the

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.449 
well doesn't mean that sir I've got the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
same end result and at the top here slim

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.300 
same end result and at the top here slim
piece<00:03:38.609> an<00:03:38.819> important<00:03:39.599> line<00:03:39.949> if<00:03:40.949> you<00:03:41.099> didn't

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
piece an important line if you didn't

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.640 
piece an important line if you didn't
notice<00:03:41.639> there's<00:03:41.970> another<00:03:42.239> input<00:03:43.049> go<00:03:43.409> into<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
notice there's another input go into the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.699 
notice there's another input go into the
computer<00:03:43.889> and<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.870> wires<00:03:46.079> remote<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
computer and I have a wires remote and

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.319 
computer and I have a wires remote and
that<00:03:47.430> activates<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.680> wireless<00:03:49.680> trends

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
that activates a wireless trends

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.050 
that activates a wireless trends
transceiver<00:03:51.620> receiver<00:03:52.620> even<00:03:52.889> sorry<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.310> then

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
transceiver receiver even sorry and then

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.969 
transceiver receiver even sorry and then
that<00:03:54.659> takes<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.229> computer<00:03:55.650> I'm<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.829> that

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
that takes to the computer I'm on that

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.229 
that takes to the computer I'm on that
and<00:03:56.190> while<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.489> happens<00:03:56.849> basically

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
and while that happens basically

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.909 
and while that happens basically
security<00:03:57.840> system<00:03:58.079> turns<00:03:58.290> off<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.709> you

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
security system turns off because you

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.539 
security system turns off because you
know<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.579> know<00:03:59.699> am<00:04:01.159> pressing<00:04:02.159> your<00:04:02.400> own

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
know you know am pressing your own

know you know am pressing your own
pressure<00:04:03.299> plates<00:04:03.629> would<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.139> be<00:04:04.290> useful<00:04:04.739> at

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
pressure plates would not be useful at

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.649 
pressure plates would not be useful at
all<00:04:04.949> so<00:04:05.340> that's<00:04:05.519> why<00:04:05.639> I've<00:04:05.760> done<00:04:05.909> that<00:04:06.060> because

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
all so that's why I've done that because

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.080 
all so that's why I've done that because
it<00:04:06.930> will<00:04:07.019> just<00:04:07.169> confuse<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.849> here<00:04:08.849> we<00:04:08.970> have

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it will just confuse you here we have

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.449 
it will just confuse you here we have
blah-dee<00:04:09.329> blah-blah<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:10.470> count<00:04:10.769> system<00:04:11.040> in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
blah-dee blah-blah the count system in

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.539 
blah-dee blah-blah the count system in
terms<00:04:11.699> of<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:11.909> time<00:04:12.709> how<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.829> works<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.310> is

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
terms of the time how it works if is

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.319 
terms of the time how it works if is
that<00:04:15.470> seconds<00:04:16.470> equals<00:04:16.739> zero<00:04:17.280> zero<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.120> begin

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
that seconds equals zero zero to begin

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.240 
that seconds equals zero zero to begin
with<00:04:18.449> as<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.659> can<00:04:18.810> see<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.289> when<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.219> gets

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
with as you can see here when it gets

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.990 
with as you can see here when it gets
down<00:04:20.639> to<00:04:20.669> here<00:04:21.590> seconds<00:04:22.590> equal<00:04:23.190> seconds<00:04:23.789> plus

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
down to here seconds equal seconds plus

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.970 
down to here seconds equal seconds plus
one<00:04:24.240> so

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
one so

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.220 
one so
is<00:04:25.130> gonna<00:04:25.280> equal<00:04:25.400> 1<00:04:25.760> 1<00:04:26.000> we<00:04:26.150> equal<00:04:26.360> 2<00:04:26.480> etc<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
is gonna equal 1 1 we equal 2 etc and

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.380 
is gonna equal 1 1 we equal 2 etc and
then<00:04:27.770> if<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.370> total<00:04:28.580> amount<00:04:28.730> of<00:04:28.970> seconds

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
then if the total amount of seconds

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.720 
then if the total amount of seconds
equals<00:04:29.510> 60<00:04:30.020> then<00:04:30.590> minutes<00:04:30.920> is<00:04:31.070> gonna<00:04:31.220> gain<00:04:31.460> 1

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
equals 60 then minutes is gonna gain 1

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.700 
equals 60 then minutes is gonna gain 1
and<00:04:31.940> seconds<00:04:32.780> is<00:04:32.840> gonna<00:04:33.050> it's<00:04:33.320> going<00:04:33.590> to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
and seconds is gonna it's going to

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.100 
and seconds is gonna it's going to
become<00:04:33.860> 0<00:04:34.340> again<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.480> same<00:04:35.660> principle

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
become 0 again and the same principle

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.050 
become 0 again and the same principle
for<00:04:36.350> each<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.950> other<00:04:37.100> values<00:04:37.520> for<00:04:37.910> days

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
for each of the other values for days

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.620 
for each of the other values for days
hours<00:04:38.630> etc<00:04:39.760> now<00:04:40.760> here's<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.270> map<00:04:42.220> if<00:04:43.220> you're

or sorry using this code then you're
going<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.170> need<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:52.570> change<00:04:53.570> this<00:04:53.900> make<00:04:54.230> you

hard I mean just you could delete this
wall<00:04:58.790> here<00:04:59.120> and<00:05:00.520> then<00:05:01.520> replace<00:05:02.330> it<00:05:02.540> again<00:05:02.660> or

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
wall here and then replace it again or

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.330 
wall here and then replace it again or
something<00:05:03.650> like<00:05:03.920> that

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
something like that

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.850 
something like that
that's<00:05:04.970> quite<00:05:05.210> handy<00:05:05.570> make<00:05:05.870> sure<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.260> keep<00:05:06.680> in

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
that's quite handy make sure you keep in

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.580 
that's quite handy make sure you keep in
mind<00:05:06.890> of<00:05:07.160> these<00:05:07.310> though<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:10.580> terms<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:11.590> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
mind of these though and in terms of the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.900 
mind of these though and in terms of the
color<00:05:13.100> testing<00:05:14.890> what<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:16.040> does<00:05:16.190> here<00:05:16.430> for

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
color testing what it does here for

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.370 
color testing what it does here for
whites<00:05:17.350> here<00:05:18.370> we<00:05:19.370> see<00:05:19.640> a<00:05:20.150> similar<00:05:21.050> system<00:05:21.200> to

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
whites here we see a similar system to

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.440 
whites here we see a similar system to
my<00:05:21.680> quarry<00:05:21.980> system<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:22.790> showed<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.090> a

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
my quarry system that I showed you a

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.910 
my quarry system that I showed you a
couple<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:23.780> days<00:05:23.900> ago<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:26.110> if<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.380> color<00:05:27.680> test

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
couple of days ago and if the color test

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.340 
couple of days ago and if the color test
is<00:05:28.070> true<00:05:28.220> it's<00:05:28.520> going<00:05:28.670> to<00:05:28.730> make<00:05:28.850> q<00:05:29.300> equal<00:05:29.690> the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
is true it's going to make q equal the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.980 
is true it's going to make q equal the
current<00:05:30.530> seconds<00:05:31.190> W<00:05:31.850> equal<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.300> minutes<00:05:32.600> etc

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
current seconds W equal the minutes etc

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.300 
current seconds W equal the minutes etc
etc<00:05:33.730> then<00:05:34.730> down<00:05:34.940> here<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.300> can<00:05:35.450> see<00:05:35.690> that<00:05:36.310> it's

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
etc then down here you can see that it's

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.810 
etc then down here you can see that it's
where<00:05:37.970> are<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.300> worried<00:05:38.540> it<00:05:38.990> prints<00:05:39.820> those

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
where are you worried it prints those

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.220 
where are you worried it prints those
values<00:05:41.210> across<00:05:41.480> there<00:05:41.750> so<00:05:41.780> that's<00:05:42.110> quite

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
values across there so that's quite

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.970 
values across there so that's quite
useful<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.780> think<00:05:44.780> that's<00:05:45.140> it<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.530> conclude

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
useful and I think that's it to conclude

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.280 
useful and I think that's it to conclude
