00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.299
 greet friends in touch Vasily 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.919
 book in this video 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.490
 I will add my video lessons if you have not 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.230
 have seen 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
 look at the channel free video tutorials 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.180
 on Yandex direct added such here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.390
 a little research how to reduce the price 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.510
 click on Yandex Direct 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.640
 manipulating ad content 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.489
 let's start here's the first example with us 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 there is an ad not immediately buy a watch and 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.680
 Our pregnancy is easy to buy a watch 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 in the title and buy a watch in the text 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 As we can see such a bet 722 here is that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.140
 further comes next we take and for 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 comparisons just add the title 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 words cheap see rate increased 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.800
 it was 7:22 became 745 so if 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 all of a sudden there are additional headers 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 words that carry knit your phrase and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.260
 veins somatic raises us 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:14.159
 initial bid further we 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.560
 we add already actually in the description 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.120
 announcements also additional text 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.660
 we see the rate still increased go further 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.080
 now we write long ads 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.020
 wear headlines too much word and our our 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.200
 the key is repeated twice in the text 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.930
 announcements receive rates 969 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.300
 stomp on if we delete the words 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.660
 inexpensive which was the extra place we 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.560
 we get stark 845 and running ahead 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.020
 I will say that this is the best option 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:56.280
 when our phrase is completely duplicated in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.330
 header and repeats 2 times in the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.040
 text ads let's see to 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.770
 what happened next now we change 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 buy a watch for all sorts of they are obtained in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.900
 one occurrence for the head with 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.080
 addition and one entry in the text as 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.020
 see the rate increased again we continue 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.400
 delete words cheap 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.340
 leave both occurrences in the description as 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 see fear is still higher than 8 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:35.210
 penny what we do next further 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:39.350
 we remove our cheap contributes 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.280
 drives the same thing but what did not 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.040
 identity tablet look further further 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.660
 we leave only 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.330
 occurrence of the word clock the second time you 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.880
 just for fun to see mine too 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.390
 will affect how we see the rate in the uss she 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:00.760
 grown up there if the cry is partial worn 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.670
 as it reduces the price of the click 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.210
 go ahead we try blon love everyone 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.400
 templates paste the template on top but 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.460
 here we have driving twice 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.020
 the description of the department we see also the rate 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:23.660
 higher than 8 than gomorr I still there 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.380
 repeat our ideal look 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.020
 what we see and while I was testing someone 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.550
 changed rates and a little park grew 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.780
 2 lower than color options then 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.960
 there is such an option 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.660
 before the heading enters our phrase twice 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.590
 I repeat the text I am not up to us 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.870
 optimal 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.610
 put on the plan than the minimum 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.650
 what else was i tested here 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.850
 such an option under truth ponds just 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.620
 about inclined our clocks 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.590
 written hours the second time as we see 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.250
 rate rose again declines words 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.700
 apparently not desirable and 2 case you 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.470
 just took and swapped 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.050
 buy a watch for an hour and buy between 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.270
 put the cheek block on recognize 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.530
 index as we see the principle of nothing 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:22.460
 changed here how was so here 84 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.260
 order class 864 is this son 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.750
 the best option and 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.020
 you can do so here with us to 3 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.660
 our sword went without any personal 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.460
 all heads to have it repeated in 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.390
 the first line that is either twice 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.580
 repeated roughly writing when 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.980
 the fact that you can change the words are not 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.190
 insert various prepositions on the screen 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.640
 saver meek excrement and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.350
 thanks to which i think especially 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.920
 low frequency queries for the next 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.530
 query type class can be great 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.620
 100 need to be understood separately that for 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.150
 high-frequency queries probably 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.580
 the conversion will be higher 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.410
 if there is a certain title 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.560
 specifics for example if you have the 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.920
 best price and you have it heading 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:20.040
 then surely your vision is bigger and 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.200
 sense of what is Leningrad big city 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.050
 or than competitors fear yet 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.730
 decrease from the time you need to understand that 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.890
 This is a test at the start that will be in 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.890
 further depend and just on 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:38.040
 content up to how many times the furnace 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.410
 where is included but also the fact that specific 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.400
 things written on some on the price tag 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.490
 terms of whom words are p to and advancement and 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.560
 how much cooler is your competitor 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.360
 here's the thing anyway if you don't believe 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.840
 better check with you for your niche 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.910
 to know exactly what's up with you 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.370
