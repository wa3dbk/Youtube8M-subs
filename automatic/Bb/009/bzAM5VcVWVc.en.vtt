00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hi all guys and girls here today may 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.960
 with a new section dedicated to mario 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.059
 kart 8 that game that will occupy so much 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960
 on my channel when I leave even before 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 already having them I want to be a session of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.609
 progress and analysis of how little has 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 seen so far from the circuits that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.760
 I liked the most 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.090
 circuits that you tell me are worth 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 those who are liking you too 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.050
 today today, May 4th, now 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.820
 you know what all the circuits are 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 there are videos on youtube and they can be made 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.660
 this session that I have thought of these and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 his battery in two the first part is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.480
 this before the game of the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 plan to analyze what little we have and see 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 the circuits see the music see 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 possible shortcuts et cetera etcetera a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.969
 analysis a little bit above since of course 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 I still can not play I can not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.260
 analyze more that audio and the second 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.879
 part will be when the game that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.960
 I want to do guides and analysis of the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.940
 circuits that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.510
 characters are better for those 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.180
 circuits in order that parts of 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.940
 kart of wheel bikes in short what are 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.790
 the best for each circuit and I hope 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.310
 that you like everything to say also that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.470
 this first part as it is obvious the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.600
 gameplay shown is not mine once 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.250
 of my property is worth 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.229
 are channels that will appear in the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.700
 description of each one of the videos of 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.260
 the progress I'm going to make of the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.970
 circuits 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.700
 valero of my property but at least 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.210
 I give support and support, I want to say that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.610
 these channels have gone to events have 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.460
 recorded and they have gone home and they have uploaded it 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.450
 they have commented on it in order to thank 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.070
 to those channels because without them 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.420
 we will have more information on youtube in 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.490
 information for us those who do not 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.990
 we can not even there are only vale are 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.550
 English channels that will not understand 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.960
 nothing of what I am saying but 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.670
 least of them at least if 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 they enter my channel and see that their gameplay 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.290
 is yours the description is your channel 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.420
 to enter and so that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.300
 Subscribers enter and support the channel 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.160
 original that the event has fallen and has 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.650
 caught the video and upload it to youtube 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.460
 from here thank you and thank you very much 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.200
 in case you do not understand much in the end we're going to 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.720
 I hope you like it and good 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.260
 You know life apps and I leave you with the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 analysis 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.340
 the first circuit that I want to analyze 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 for you it's mario kart stadium the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.819
 first circuit of mario kart 8 el 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.560
 first circuit of the tournament is worth 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.790
 It's funny because in other brands 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.920
 we have always had a first circuit 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.719
 where there were few spectators only 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 the grid and green areas 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:43.290
 they were we do not have a piece of circuit 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.790
 in the middle of a gigantic city and very 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.750
 based on the typical circuits of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.239
 Formula 1 asphalt few curves circuit 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.530
 easy to drive since it is the first and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.840
 we have a lot very much very much 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.909
 public the truth is that I liked 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.530
 quite the small details are the 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.900
 that make games great and in this 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.489
 case is mario kart 8 give us to understand 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.840
 forget about the little games of 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.599
 mario kart earlier because in this 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.980
 case we are before a mario kart that is 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.840
 being broadcast by the whole world 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 that has sponsors that is like 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.090
 basically formula 1 but in the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.360
 mario kart world there are teams there 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.430
 many very very big things 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.590
 and it's being retransmitted by various 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.960
 catch and we're not getting into a 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.570
 world is worth I know that we do not have the 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.110
 story of the game but in mario kart 8 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.500
 they give us to understand that we are no longer in 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.100
 the little screws of mario kart 64 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.080
 mario kart ds we are not facing a big 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.870
 tournament that is supposedly being watched 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.900
 throughout the mushroom kingdom and we are going to 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.750
 understand with all the propaganda everything 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.020
 that is predisposed by the scenario 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.209
 helicopters cameras et cetera etcetera 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.000
 it is no longer simply the attitude with 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.760
 a camera recording now we have a 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.190
 good distribution amazing cameras by 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.890
 all such parts by all 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.440
 parts of the stage and as I said a 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.970
 large number of public the small 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.470
 details are great but there are also 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.090
 have to look at the protagonist of this 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.030
 circuit that is the anti zone 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.440
 gravitational a vertical curve that 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.840
 has to see from anywhere in the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.760
 circuit once we get close to 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.500
 she would at least give me even 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.860
 vertigo to enter 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.930
 we can not notice much that we are in 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.760
 a completely vertical surface 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.560
 but when they gave the first curve the 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.000
 curve the first the only curve that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.280
 has this anti gravitational zone we see 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.570
 that the stage is just below 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.430
 of us the circuit is just 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.440
 under us we go to the public 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.150
 right under us and I think that 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.550
 it gives a little bit of vertigo this and the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.950
 truth is that it is really great 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.580
 Nintendo has worked a lot this guy 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:58.240
 of zone this new zone and even if 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.730
 let's go the last ones or in between the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.330
 group we can see our adversary 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.890
 how are they basically over our 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.630
 He launched the old trio before the entrance 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.490
 we are even far away we can see 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.590
 how are they stuck to that curve 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.380
 vertically we still have all 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.000
 come simply great the shortcuts of 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.950
 the first circuits to market 8 do not 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.270
 they are great thing but nothing else to start the 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.370
 first curve the right we have a 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.950
 pipe tubes area here we can 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.390
 pass if we have some turbo at the end 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.470
 of the circuit we also have another area 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.720
 identical 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.340
 just after starting the antich zone 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.930
 Oria habitat we have a ramp that if 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.060
 we have a turbo we can go through it 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.030
 and save 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.280
 and right after finishing the area in 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.740
 victory wheat we have a twig before 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.740
 to get to the end of the circuit 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.400
 good guys from here I hope everything 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.320
 you liked it already you know if I wanted 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.020
 some other circuit analyzed already what 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.840
 you can ask and you can go through the 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.870
 channels that have offered these gameplays 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.730
 do not forget to support the gameplay 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.070
 original and nothing we see it in the next 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.200
 hip hop video and do not forget about 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.200
 subscribe goodbye to all
