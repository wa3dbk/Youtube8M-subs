single<00:00:24.240> day<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.720> insoles<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:26.570> mainly

single day about insoles and how mainly

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
single day about insoles and how mainly
because<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> ADI<00:00:28.439> zeros<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.859> think<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> IDS

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
because of the ADI zeros I think the IDS

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
because of the ADI zeros I think the IDS
zeros<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.420> started<00:00:30.660> coming<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.140> this

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
zeros when they started coming with this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
zeros when they started coming with this
like<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.340> here<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.700> comfort<00:00:33.090> insole<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
then the lightweight insula they really

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.910 
then the lightweight insula they really
started<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> trend<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.920> insoles

personally not my favorite insel I don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.700 
personally not my favorite insel I don't
like<00:01:03.000> using<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.930> tends<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.229> slide<00:01:04.470> around

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
like using it it tends to slide around

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.500 
like using it it tends to slide around
on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> inside<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> shoe<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.450> don't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
on the inside of the shoe and I don't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
on the inside of the shoe and I don't
think<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> lot<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> people<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.229> use<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> think

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
think a lot of people do use it I think

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.960 
think a lot of people do use it I think
they<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.189> take<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> option<00:01:08.729> put<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
they kind of take the option put the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.200 
they kind of take the option put the
comfort<00:01:09.270> insole<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:11.430> insole<00:01:11.820> weighs<00:01:12.000> in

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
comfort insole in this insole weighs in

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
comfort insole in this insole weighs in
at<00:01:12.390> point<00:01:13.200> 4<00:01:13.439> ounces<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.490> definitely<00:01:14.850> on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
at point 4 ounces so it's definitely on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200 
at point 4 ounces so it's definitely on
the<00:01:15.090> lightweight<00:01:15.420> side<00:01:16.130> it's<00:01:17.130> basically<00:01:17.610> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the lightweight side it's basically it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
the lightweight side it's basically it's
basically<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.689> nothing<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> guess<00:01:19.979> what

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basically in nothing in so I guess what

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
basically in nothing in so I guess what
I<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.280> say<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:21.509> nothing<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.110> really

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I would say there's nothing to really

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
I would say there's nothing to really
provide<00:01:22.530> grip<00:01:22.770> against<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.280> foot<00:01:23.659> it's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
provide grip against your foot it's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
provide grip against your foot it's
completely<00:01:25.200> perforated<00:01:25.710> there's<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> lot

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
completely perforated there's not a lot

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
completely perforated there's not a lot
of<00:01:26.280> there's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.270> lot<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.450> foam<00:01:27.840> between

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
of there's not a lot of foam between

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
of there's not a lot of foam between
your<00:01:28.350> foot<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.640> bottom<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> shoe<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
your foot and the bottom of the shoe so

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.719 
your foot and the bottom of the shoe so
it's<00:01:30.570> basically<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.930> running<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.740> nothing

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's basically like running on nothing

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's basically like running on nothing
is<00:01:32.790> basically<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> running<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.600> plastic<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is basically like running on plastic and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
is basically like running on plastic and
then<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> comfort<00:01:35.400> insole<00:01:35.790> which

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
then you have the comfort insole which
