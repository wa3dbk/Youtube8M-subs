this<00:05:47.430> summer<00:05:48.410> if<00:05:49.410> i<00:05:50.130> can't<00:05:50.340> get<00:05:50.490> financed

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
this summer if i can't get financed

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.860 
this summer if i can't get financed
pretty<00:05:51.270> much<00:05:51.390> i'm<00:05:51.570> thought<00:05:52.100> so<00:05:53.450> if<00:05:54.450> i<00:05:54.600> can't

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
pretty much i'm thought so if i can't

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.080 
pretty much i'm thought so if i can't
get<00:05:55.020> financed<00:05:55.500> I<00:05:55.740> need<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.010> save<00:05:56.220> up<00:05:56.250> 14<00:05:56.790> grand

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
get financed I need to save up 14 grand

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.480 
get financed I need to save up 14 grand
before<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:57.900> can<00:05:58.110> get<00:05:58.230> to<00:05:58.410> surgery<00:05:58.650> hold<00:05:59.220> on<00:05:59.370> one

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
before I can get to surgery hold on one

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:18.870 
before I can get to surgery hold on one
second

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.930 

so<00:06:19.880> if<00:06:20.000> i<00:06:20.090> can't<00:06:20.330> get<00:06:20.419> financed<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:21.850> need<00:06:22.850> to

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
so if i can't get financed I need to

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.210 
so if i can't get financed I need to
save<00:06:23.120> up<00:06:23.150> 14<00:06:23.660> grand<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:27.530> that's<00:06:27.800> where<00:06:27.949> I'm<00:06:28.070> at
