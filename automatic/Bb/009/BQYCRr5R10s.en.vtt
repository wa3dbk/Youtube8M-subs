00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
as for gameplay I can't judge a hundred

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.319 
as for gameplay I can't judge a hundred
percent<00:02:16.530> since<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.010> haven't<00:02:17.310> seen<00:02:17.430> much<00:02:17.489> from

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
percent since we haven't seen much from

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.000 
percent since we haven't seen much from
what<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.719> seen<00:02:18.750> she<00:02:19.590> doesn't<00:02:19.799> look<00:02:19.859> like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
what I have seen she doesn't look like

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.580 
what I have seen she doesn't look like
my<00:02:20.159> kind<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.459> character<00:02:20.849> her<00:02:21.299> design<00:02:21.659> not<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
my kind of character her design not a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.020 
my kind of character her design not a
big<00:02:22.769> fan<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.010> our<00:02:23.189> design<00:02:23.430> kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> looks<00:02:23.909> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
big fan of our design kind of looks a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.490 
big fan of our design kind of looks a
lot<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.390> Cassie's<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.200> bland

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
lot like Cassie's kind of bland

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
lot like Cassie's kind of bland
hopefully<00:02:26.280> she'll<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.579> cooler<00:02:26.879> alternate

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
hopefully she'll get a cooler alternate

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.179 
hopefully she'll get a cooler alternate
costume<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.290> she<00:02:28.319> definitely<00:02:28.620> has<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> really

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
costume but she definitely has a really

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.460

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
design is the best design yet if as you

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.280 
design is the best design yet if as you
can<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.370> here<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.359> variation<00:02:39.870> differences

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
can see here the variation differences

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
design the American flag wrapped around

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.960 
design the American flag wrapped around
his<00:02:51.900> arm<00:02:51.989> his<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:53.069> see<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.639> do<00:02:53.790> see<00:02:53.939> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
his arm his we see a do we do see a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780 
his arm his we see a do we do see a
brief<00:02:54.480> part<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.200> his<00:02:55.319> x-ray<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:56.220> where<00:02:56.669> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
brief part of his x-ray here where it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.089 
brief part of his x-ray here where it
looks<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.030> he<00:02:57.239> destroys<00:02:57.689> the<00:02:57.870> ribcage<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:58.769> I

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
looks like he destroys the ribcage now I

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.429 
looks like he destroys the ribcage now I
assume<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.060> Jax<00:03:00.510> was<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.409> a

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
assume that Jax was not going to have a

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.500 
assume that Jax was not going to have a
skull<00:03:01.859> related<00:03:02.220> x-rays<00:03:02.639> he's<00:03:02.879> always<00:03:03.239> kind<00:03:03.389> of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
skull related x-rays he's always kind of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.020 
skull related x-rays he's always kind of
been<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.720> grappler<00:03:04.200> type<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.430> don't<00:03:05.730> know

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
been a grappler type and so I don't know

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.839 
been a grappler type and so I don't know
if<00:03:06.299> he's<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:07.129> hit<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.159> face<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.760> he

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
if he's going to hit the face and if he

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.879 
if he's going to hit the face and if he
does<00:03:09.120> i<00:03:09.419> can<00:03:09.569> imagine<00:03:09.750> him<00:03:10.019> picking<00:03:10.799> the

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
does i can imagine him picking the

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.530 
does i can imagine him picking the
opponent<00:03:11.250> up<00:03:11.310> by<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.459> throat<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.879> doing<00:03:12.419> that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
opponent up by the throat and doing that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.729 
opponent up by the throat and doing that
grab<00:03:12.810> move<00:03:13.019> where<00:03:13.200> he<00:03:13.230> punches<00:03:13.500> him<00:03:13.620> in<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
grab move where he punches him in the

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
face a couple times as we do see that

head<00:04:03.599> up<00:04:03.720> upwards<00:04:04.319> so<00:04:05.189> i<00:04:05.220> don't<00:04:05.400> know<00:04:05.459> if

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
head up upwards so i don't know if

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.099 
head up upwards so i don't know if
that's<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.819> same<00:04:06.000> fatality<00:04:06.629> or<00:04:06.659> if<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
that's the same fatality or if it

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.080 
that's the same fatality or if it
correlates<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.430> could<00:04:08.609> be<00:04:08.729> a<00:04:08.760> different

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
correlates to it it could be a different

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.249 
correlates to it it could be a different
fatality<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:09.569> i'm<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.840> going<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.199> assume

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:10.259 
fatality but i'm just going to assume

that<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:10.799> the<00:04:11.250> same<00:04:11.459> fatality<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.379> it's

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
that it is the same fatality and it's

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.110 
that it is the same fatality and it's
looking<00:04:13.560> pretty<00:04:13.889> cool<00:04:14.099> i<00:04:14.340> really<00:04:14.400> like<00:04:14.819> Jax
