I<00:01:56.150> guess<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.049> world's<00:01:57.350> not<00:01:57.530> worth<00:01:57.710> very<00:01:58.009> much

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.180 

it's<00:02:03.729> very<00:02:04.090> mysterious<00:02:04.360> ball<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.470> am<00:02:05.860> named<00:02:06.070> it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's very mysterious ball I am named it
myself<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:07.119> looks<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.659> world<00:02:07.869> will<00:02:08.050> be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
myself it looks like the world will be

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.729 
myself it looks like the world will be
spared<00:02:08.530> from<00:02:08.770> certain<00:02:09.250> annihilation

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.350 

strike<00:02:12.739> two<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:15.800> just<00:02:16.520> three<00:02:16.760> pitches<00:02:17.000> yet
