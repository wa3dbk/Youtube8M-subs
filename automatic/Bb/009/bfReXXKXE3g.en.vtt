that<00:01:07.619> character<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.939> pretty<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.330> from<00:01:09.510> DC<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.810 
Captain America sometimes and then
that's<00:01:54.090> pretty<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.490> Marvel<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.579> DC

that's pretty much it for Marvel and DC

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810 
that's pretty much it for Marvel and DC
comic<00:01:57.420> books<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:58.079> terms<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.770> movies<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.670> stuff

you<00:01:59.969> guys<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> watch<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.200> channel

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.219 
you guys know if you watch on my channel
for<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> while<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.329> think<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.020> CRISPR

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
for a while I think that the CRISPR

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
for a while I think that the CRISPR
Nolan<00:02:04.649> Batman<00:02:04.799> movies<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> best

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
Nolan Batman movies are the best

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.109 
Nolan Batman movies are the best
conflict<00:02:06.750> movies<00:02:06.990> ever<00:02:07.170> made<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.119> obviously

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
conflict movies ever made and obviously

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
conflict movies ever made and obviously
Dark<00:02:09.330> Knight<00:02:09.450> Rises<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.080> yet<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
Dark Knight Rises not out yet but the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.430 
Dark Knight Rises not out yet but the
first<00:02:10.979> two<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.230> those

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
first two I think are and so just those

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.830 
first two I think are and so just those
two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
two

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.080 
two
I'd<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:14.890> with<00:02:14.920> DC<00:02:15.370> over<00:02:15.640> Marvel<00:02:16.000> when

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I'd have to go with DC over Marvel when

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.640 
I'd have to go with DC over Marvel when
it<00:02:16.120> comes<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> movies<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.170> everything

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
it comes to the movies and everything

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.809 
it comes to the movies and everything
Marvel's<00:02:18.310> done

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
Marvel's done

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.490 
Marvel's done
I<00:02:18.849> still<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.540> those<00:02:19.750> I'd<00:02:20.050> rather<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I still think those I'd rather have

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.940 
I still think those I'd rather have
those<00:02:21.129> two<00:02:21.430> movies<00:02:21.819> exist<00:02:22.230> versus<00:02:23.230> all<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
those two movies exist versus all of the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.729 
those two movies exist versus all of the
Marvel<00:02:24.340> stuff<00:02:24.580> if<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.150> had<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.420> choose<00:02:25.629> between

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
Marvel stuff if I had to choose between

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.199 
Marvel stuff if I had to choose between
just<00:02:26.739> those<00:02:26.920> two<00:02:27.129> movies<00:02:27.459> or<00:02:27.700> three<00:02:28.000> and

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
just those two movies or three and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300 
just those two movies or three and
everything<00:02:29.170> Marvel's<00:02:29.500> ever<00:02:29.650> done<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.980> movies

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
everything Marvel's ever done in movies

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.240 
everything Marvel's ever done in movies
I<00:02:30.489> pick<00:02:30.819> those<00:02:31.060> those<00:02:31.660> two<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.140> also<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
I pick those those two I also like the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.070 
I pick those those two I also like the
x-men<00:02:33.549> movies<00:02:33.610> quite<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> bit<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:34.930> that

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
x-men movies quite a bit I think that

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.740 
x-men movies quite a bit I think that
x-men<00:02:35.799> 3<00:02:35.830> had<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> lot<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:36.970> problems<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.569> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
x-men 3 had a lot of problems and I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.420 
x-men 3 had a lot of problems and I
didn't<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.349> it<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:38.620> much<00:02:38.830> but<00:02:39.010> x-two<00:02:39.400> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
didn't like it as much but x-two and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.369 
didn't like it as much but x-two and
x-one<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.970> thought<00:02:40.239> were<00:02:40.450> really<00:02:40.629> good<00:02:40.750> at<00:02:41.049> x2

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
x-one I thought were really good at x2

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.440 
x-one I thought were really good at x2
especially<00:02:41.980> because<00:02:42.819> you<00:02:42.970> got<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.209> see<00:02:43.299> some

I<00:03:34.410> was<00:03:35.410> always<00:03:35.680> from<00:03:36.370> Marvel<00:03:36.970> almost<00:03:37.450> my<00:03:37.660> whole

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
I was always from Marvel almost my whole

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.839 
I was always from Marvel almost my whole
life<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:40.000> growing<00:03:40.599> up<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.900> everything<00:03:40.989> but

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
life is growing up and everything but

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.720 
life is growing up and everything but
within<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.090> past<00:03:43.120> probably<00:03:43.870> 5<00:03:44.169> to<00:03:44.560> 7<00:03:45.069> years<00:03:45.489> I

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
within the past probably 5 to 7 years I

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.559 
within the past probably 5 to 7 years I
feel<00:03:46.239> like<00:03:46.450> I've<00:03:46.720> kind<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.760> gone<00:03:48.760> more<00:03:49.120> over<00:03:49.419> to

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
feel like I've kind of gone more over to

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.680 
feel like I've kind of gone more over to
DC<00:03:49.900> okay<00:03:50.079> well<00:03:50.349> I'll<00:03:50.470> say<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.269> I'm<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> huge

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
DC okay well I'll say this I'm a huge

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.180 
DC okay well I'll say this I'm a huge
fan<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.169> x-men<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.530> think<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.799> x-men<00:03:54.130> are

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
fan of the x-men I think the x-men are

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.670 
fan of the x-men I think the x-men are
the<00:03:54.489> best<00:03:54.669> super<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> team<00:03:55.209> there<00:03:55.419> is<00:03:55.680> after

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
the best super a team there is after

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.860 
the best super a team there is after
that<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:56.889> like<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> Justice<00:03:57.910> League<00:03:58.150> more<00:03:58.599> than

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
that I like the Justice League more than

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.339 
that I like the Justice League more than
the<00:03:58.959> Avengers<00:03:59.099> generally<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:01.450> Avengers<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.290> do

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
the Avengers generally the Avengers I do

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.539 
the Avengers generally the Avengers I do
like<00:04:02.919> quite<00:04:03.489> a<00:04:03.519> bit<00:04:03.639> but<00:04:05.099> there's<00:04:06.099> only<00:04:06.250> some

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
like quite a bit but there's only some

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.159 
like quite a bit but there's only some
storylines<00:04:07.090> with<00:04:07.269> them<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.720> think<00:04:08.019> are

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
storylines with them that I think are

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.629 
storylines with them that I think are
interesting<00:04:08.349> a<00:04:08.889> lot<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.310> times<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.579> think

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
interesting a lot of times I think

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.009 
interesting a lot of times I think
Avenger<00:04:10.090> stories<00:04:10.419> feels<00:04:10.630> like<00:04:10.810> they're

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
Avenger stories feels like they're

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.870 
Avenger stories feels like they're
they're<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.530> very<00:04:11.829> forced<00:04:12.340> like<00:04:12.549> all<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
they're just very forced like all the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.920 
they're just very forced like all the
characters<00:04:13.209> are<00:04:13.329> forced<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.840> together

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
characters are forced to be together

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.870 
characters are forced to be together
when<00:04:14.440> they<00:04:14.530> throw<00:04:14.769> in<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.099> New<00:04:15.639> Avengers

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
when they throw in like New Avengers

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.729 
when they throw in like New Avengers
they<00:04:16.209> put<00:04:16.389> Wolverine<00:04:16.870> spider-man<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.560> stuff

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
they put Wolverine spider-man and stuff

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.199 
they put Wolverine spider-man and stuff
it<00:04:17.889> just<00:04:17.919> feels<00:04:18.220> like<00:04:18.340> they're<00:04:18.519> force<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:19.060> to

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
it just feels like they're force just to

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.120 
it just feels like they're force just to
sell<00:04:19.840> comics<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.560> stuff<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.889> know<00:04:21.010> because

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
sell comics and stuff you know because

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.890 
sell comics and stuff you know because
they<00:04:21.549> don't<00:04:21.639> really<00:04:21.880> belong<00:04:22.150> there<00:04:22.210> they're

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
they don't really belong there they're

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.990 
they don't really belong there they're
just<00:04:23.080> thrown<00:04:23.289> together<00:04:23.469> just<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.310> make<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.550> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
just thrown together just to make it you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.050 
just thrown together just to make it you
know<00:04:25.090> all<00:04:26.219> you<00:04:27.219> know

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
know all you know

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.910 
know all you know
exciting<00:04:28.720> for<00:04:28.840> buyers<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.740> kind<00:04:29.889> of

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
exciting for buyers and that kind of

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.110 
exciting for buyers and that kind of
stuff<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:32.290> know<00:04:32.400> Marvel<00:04:33.400> has<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.610> lot<00:04:34.090> more

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
stuff so you know Marvel has a lot more

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.690 
stuff so you know Marvel has a lot more
characters<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.080> think<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.410> are<00:04:35.530> more<00:04:36.490> well

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
characters I think that are more well

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.390 
characters I think that are more well
fleshed<00:04:36.940> out<00:04:37.150> than<00:04:37.419> DC<00:04:37.780> does<00:04:38.310> Marvel<00:04:39.310> of

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
fleshed out than DC does Marvel of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.640 
fleshed out than DC does Marvel of
course<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.760> x-men<00:04:40.090> alone<00:04:40.630> have<00:04:40.960> tons<00:04:41.380> of

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
course the x-men alone have tons of

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.190 
course the x-men alone have tons of
characters<00:04:42.100> like<00:04:42.160> tons<00:04:42.639> of<00:04:42.850> characters<00:04:43.270> The

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
characters like tons of characters The

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.720 
characters like tons of characters The
Avengers<00:04:44.290> as<00:04:44.710> well<00:04:44.889> tons<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.430> different

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
Avengers as well tons of different

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.350 
Avengers as well tons of different
characters<00:04:46.060> in<00:04:46.090> there<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:47.760> so<00:04:48.760> they<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:48.940> think

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
characters in there and so they I think

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.840 
characters in there and so they I think
Marvel<00:04:49.690> has<00:04:49.810> more<00:04:50.639> characters<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:51.760> are

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
Marvel has more characters that are

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.659 
Marvel has more characters that are
decent<00:04:52.060> but<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.690> think<00:04:52.930> DC<00:04:53.139> has<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.620> few<00:04:54.040> really

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
decent but I think DC has a few really

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.430 
decent but I think DC has a few really
really<00:04:54.820> great<00:04:55.330> characters<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:55.990> think<00:04:56.230> that

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
really great characters and I think that

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.400 
really great characters and I think that
Batman<00:04:56.919> is<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.190> greatest<00:04:58.050> superhero<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.260> my

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
Batman is the greatest superhero in my

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.930 
Batman is the greatest superhero in my
opinion<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.950> Joker<00:05:00.340> probably<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.760> best

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
opinion the Joker probably the best

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.520 
opinion the Joker probably the best
villain<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.480> all<00:05:01.660> of<00:05:01.870> comic<00:05:02.230> books<00:05:02.410> in

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
villain in all of comic books in

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.780 
villain in all of comic books in
either-or<00:05:02.980> so<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:05.740> kind<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.340> hard<00:05:06.520> for<00:05:06.550> me<00:05:06.700> to

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
either-or so it's kind of hard for me to

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.240 
either-or so it's kind of hard for me to
decide<00:05:07.180> between<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.660> two<00:05:07.690> because<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.740> think

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
decide between the two because I think

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.700 
decide between the two because I think
deep<00:05:09.970> what<00:05:10.330> DC<00:05:10.540> has<00:05:10.840> with<00:05:11.050> Batman<00:05:11.440> is<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> best

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
deep what DC has with Batman is the best

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.500 
deep what DC has with Batman is the best
there<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.970> then<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.270> other<00:05:13.360> hand

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
there is but then on the other hand

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.020 
there is but then on the other hand
Marvel<00:05:14.230> just<00:05:14.440> seems<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:14.770> have<00:05:14.950> more<00:05:15.250> decent

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
Marvel just seems to have more decent

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.200 
Marvel just seems to have more decent
stuff<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.110> lot<00:05:17.290> more<00:05:17.560> in<00:05:17.710> my<00:05:17.740> opinion<00:05:18.180> but<00:05:19.180> I

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
stuff and a lot more in my opinion but I

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.780 
stuff and a lot more in my opinion but I
do<00:05:19.330> really<00:05:19.630> like<00:05:19.900> shows<00:05:20.320> like<00:05:20.560> for<00:05:20.710> example

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
do really like shows like for example

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.860 
do really like shows like for example
Justice<00:05:21.790> League<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.120> thought<00:05:22.300> was<00:05:22.419> really<00:05:22.720> well

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
Justice League I thought was really well

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.469 
Justice League I thought was really well
done<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.650> cartoon<00:05:24.010> show<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.820> you<00:05:25.240> know<00:05:25.300> I<00:05:25.360> can

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
done the cartoon show and you know I can

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
I would go with with DC but because of
