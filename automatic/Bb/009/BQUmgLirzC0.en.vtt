00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello the most curious things of the winter in the Cantabrian coast 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.389
 gift of hundreds of thousands of starlings 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.599
 I chose the coastal locations and escorts of a complete album because 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.599
 offers them a lot of shelter in the cold winter nights 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:23.909
 If that tree palm trees the palm tree is not a policy in Asturias but that 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:27.169
 was brought in late singles and doubles by the Indians with the 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.429
 intention to plant the phrases of their new public parks flights 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.660
 for our great-grandparents the palm tree was a symbol of wealth and triumph and 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.879
 the more the better but for the starlings they are ideal albert in the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.230
 cold winter nights in it takes refuge because twice 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.870
 the interesting couple talking 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.140
 exercise the village also counselor of the bank 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.220
 situations similar to palm trees on the Cantabrian coast little by little 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.570
 you have to cover yourself because the biggest problem of flocks of starlings 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.329
 these rains from inside their houses are very acidic as for the birds 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.689
 and its enormous number originated an authentic snowfall from events under the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.540
 palm trees that could seriously scratch the trees these birds 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 arrive to Spain a fifth of the cold winters of northern Europe 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 only in the city of GijÃ³n the experts calculate that they can intern 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.409
 fecac of 200 thousand starlings in GijÃ³n apply since the end of November a 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.939
 system to scare them the method consists of a very special audience that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 it is emitted by strategically placed speakers and I say 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.409
 special because it's a little patented by the company that handles the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.190
 scarecrow works 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.190
 the campaign has a budget of 11 thousand euros and according to the company in charge 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.080
 reduces the number of birds in the city from two hundred thousand to about 4 thousand more 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.190
 or less 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.810
 This problem is that the flocks of birds look for other places of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.450
 refuge although it is difficult to know if the flocks in December the resemblance in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.120
 the palm trees of the coastal villages have a bonus or simply 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.370
 adds interior locations pushed by the Siberian cold wave 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.820
 yet we must not forget that the starlings to a devouring machine of 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.620
 insects and they are only here running away from the cold without them all nature 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.849
 of Europe would be altered and with it our crops 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.260
 the point is that there is less 30 minutes or cut off little gas for whom the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.989
 problem 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.779
 a problem that exceeds its municipal counter five are the autonomous 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.249
 you should not also hysteria environment help you tape while 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.160
 be big and especially the little ones 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.939
 who have fewer resources 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.299
 there should not be a European Union policy that coordinates that all 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.719
 problems arising from the migration of the species and especially the two 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.099
 problems that are causing invasive species 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.760
 and such with this help you could avoid really depressing situations 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.960
 as those that have lived in some localities where killings have taken place 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.590
 starlings
