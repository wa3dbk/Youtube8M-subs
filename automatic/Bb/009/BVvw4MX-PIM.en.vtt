00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 we are now dealing with the operation of the iPhone 4s 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.199
 but first I would like to go on the display which namely 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.949
 in comparison to its predecessor 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.039
 has improved in the room 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.140
 It is meant to Heiko Maas 5 it should be 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.929
 Multicard Switzerland child is sticking 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.149
 but the number of pixels has quadrupled 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.550
 for comparison with its predecessor 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.840
 So here we are talking about 960 by 640 pixels and a contrast of 802 1 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 Arndt so this high-resolution display 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 So with a lot of energy and the high-contrast 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 we look at the Mannheimer at the missions Rentsch 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 you can see it immediately so the first impression is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.080
 that is really very very tight 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.790
 I also compared the iPhone to other phones 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.830
 in which I have very nicely intertwined and you can quite St 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.100
 this is not a comparison if you look at the programs in the background 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.210
 and also 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.300
 in the foreground 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.490
 and also the background which memories 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.500
 Water drops from forms 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.330
 this is really 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.860
 very very sharp 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.140
 and to Apple manufacturers 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.580
 we also have texts on the iPhone sharper than tracks on the iPhone 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.580
 paper 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.930
 On the iPhone, the operating system is a high goal so the fourth version 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.340
 Installed 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.170
 and whenever you look at it first 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.210
 it does not really tell you that's great 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.200
 from the operating systems 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 on the program three out of 13 11 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.510
 Here we see the program they are the favorites in the foreground 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 So Safari adds that it is phone mail Cayenne 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 Web browser 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.940
 So music 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.050
 and in the background they are back to the end of March or the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.209
 Mini programs arranged 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.289
 for photos 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.979
 Notes Kalenda News 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.869
 This one can be the right one at different levels 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.689
 Sort levels 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.779
 you scroll all the way to the left 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:28.059
 actually Atif and processor directly on the iPhone at what but new 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.109
 this is added now 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.529
 a mess at the forum 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.719
 of applications and programs 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.059
 to avoid 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.660
 to now the folder function was introduced 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.479
 that means you can and for example stay here for a long time 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.969
 Press photos 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.849
 then the symbols begin to pack so a bit 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
 and then you draw a case of this program 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.439
 in 300 program 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.249
 and it automatically becomes a piece of cake 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 the iPhone is super here 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:02.729
 named examples ago 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.309
 they now have photos and camera 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.220
 and the iPhone in the fourth quarter took photography 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.589
 Here you can change or you can keep it that way 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.689
 yes you want to send a new message now 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.249
 Trittin teenagers 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:18.009
 on the news were 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.399
 you can be right 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.789
 the symbol for a new message 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.729
 and then you have the opportunity 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.729
 use the qwerty keyboard to address a message 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:31.819
 Keyboard around 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.819
 will be very small again 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.809
 but it is easy to write on it 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.879
 can the cellphone too 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.939
 then if the buttons are a little wider 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.939
 and that makes it easier to write 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
 also as you can see here 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.819
 also disguises the iPhone 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.869
 So if I wrote as StALU Alu 

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.049
 marked red for this word 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.499
 I can click on it 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:10.959
 and there is more 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.959
 Alternatives to poets may look like 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.499
 which is also interesting for me 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.239
 long to be able to 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 an airport and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.689
 I would have then 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:27.719
 can take exactly the place in the text 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.189
 want to change 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.539
 also 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.210
 I can now also select texts 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.319
 or text area spying out 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.529
 For example, holding the falling knife and giving the people 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.900
 it works 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.569
 happig marked 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.240
 I can copy that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.490
 Save to the clipboard 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 and there and for example, there was an end 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.909
 reinstate 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.409
 In addition, one has the possibilities with the iPhone 4 now 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.719
 multiple e-mail accounts 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.610
 manage at the same time 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.290
 The iPhone 4 offers a game center which is interesting for gamers since you are there 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.830
 Save scores or join the 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.120
 Can play online 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.439
 and in the iPhone 4 is a new sensor 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.180
 namely the CIOs Corp installed 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.180
 which m6 alignment and is sensitive 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.930
 interesting addition that one with 1 letter 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.189
 now also has the opportunity to read books on the iPhone 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.139
 Now we come to a very big disadvantage of the iPhone 4s 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.499
 as already known 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.129
 Sete antenna 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.629
 for mobile 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.520
 integrated into the outer stainless steel 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.629
 to receive this verdict not to receive dilution 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:50.629
 others after 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:51.979
 taken care of in one scene 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.540
 that's how deterioration felt and even to the point 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.319
 Book of phone calls 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.699
 demonstrate this from now on 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.229
 holding the iPhone in your hand like making a phone call 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:05.669
 And thereby 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.729
 this lower area 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.629
 This agrees with the reception 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.629
 so watch it at the top left corner 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.139
 I'm single 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.800
 that the bars 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.219
 for receiving ads will be less and less
