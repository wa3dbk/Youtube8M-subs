00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello all around to break this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.060
 Rixi rich evening of nonsense as at 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.760
 usually not full of news then serious 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.370
 for once speak of the motion 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.080
 strict sense because as you know in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.480
 these days eicma is being held e 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.510
 I went there I did it for you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.720
 I swear and I want to take stock of what 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 waiting for us in 2015 so we cut 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 short abbreviation first premise as you see 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 I changed house but not fond of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 too squaring because it is 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.260
 provisional second premise with 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 pride announcement that this episode is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.300
 the first to be transmitted also on 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 who by previous tweet then we do 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 hello hello to friends who listen to us 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.320
 podcasts but let's get to the things that matter 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.120
 today eicma has opened to the public as 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 every year in the last 10 I am 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.049
 snuck into the press day yes I know 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.880
 I am a paraculo and I must say that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.789
 this year difference of the last ones 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 editions fake but it seems much more 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.079
 you go to understand this is true 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.909
 permitting perhaps they are only of 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.730
 Christmas lights put on it 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.490
 dry tree 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.130
 mod on everything emerge in particular two 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.910
 trends the first concerns the bombardone 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.640
 sports and corrodes the latter the multi 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.160
 purpose on off what you want 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.800
 although they are all much more than offers 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.220
 clear if not to the contrary myths to leave 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 bombardone a bolide but if you don't 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 interested you can click here on mine 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.800
 right and run straight to the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.970
 part of the video where I talk about the others 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.920
 motorcycle that not only the bombardone made 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.930
 then I go on 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.240
 continue with bmw ma ducati products 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.370
 honda and kawasaki led to eicma 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:06.130
 a trillion horses divided as follows 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:13.810
 s1000rr 199 horses r1 200 horses 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.810
 panigale 205 horses rc213v 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:25.090
 h 2 300 horses bone has escaped and I do 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.120
 I leave and talk about street legal or motorcycle 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.280
 oh well but also first gear despite 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.200
 the market does not always start up again 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.450
 contrary to what was done in the last 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.780
 biennium in which it has been spoken at length e 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.790
 breadth of down sizing of the motorcycle 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.540
 reach of all to attract new bands 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.620
 of customers with cheap products of 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 easy 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.300
 here we reappear well maybe we have 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.490
 need to dream 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.070
 or perhaps the same builders have 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.010
 need to dream of returning to show 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:00.130
 at best their technical skills e 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.570
 technological or perhaps continue to do 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.360
 what they have always done or 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.220
 raise the bar to offer you a product 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.930
 what you can wish for and what to do 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.900
 tow to sell some more 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.620
 but which bikes those within the reach of 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.590
 all 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.380
 suitable new groups of economic customers 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.040
 and easy but they'll never do it with lire 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.130
 blood like the bologna must be said that 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.030
 few are seen as those of 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.890
 prime range with the most expensive ones 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.650
 you no longer look at sports like you 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.290
 a few years ago it was the premium segment 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.510
 now with side bags and tasty 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.300
 voting computer remains the question of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.400
 ordinary people on what roads we will drive 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.290
 these previous technological prodigies 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.200
 miur has some considerations on 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.989
 other news from the show or the bikes 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.340
 that they do everything better than everything 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.680
 expensive Swiss army knives with 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.390
 wheels apply for that answer 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.130
 primary need of the motorcyclist 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.769
 self-styled senate 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.870
 the total bike for a few years 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.150
 market statistics show us how 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.640
 driving segment or those that 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.709
 in addition to knowing how to make structure dream 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.810
 see for years but these are you 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.690
 product had to be compared with 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.250
 the bmw gs now started the first signals 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.739
 of liberation from this subjection 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.049
 psychological and conscious 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.290
 declaration comes precisely from bmw that 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.540
 he said but presented by s1000 xr 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.610
 which is a four-cylinder terrae 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.240
 sports keyboard bit like the kawasaki 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.890
 versys 1000 and a maxi setting 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.770
 tourist motard 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.290
 a bit like ducati multistrada other 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.040
 dedicated to ducati multistrada and her now 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.440
 to exercise greater 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.150
 without stylistic on the competition ea 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.240
 gods but is renewed 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.270
 heavily in the true sense that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.190
 fairing is much more massive yes 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.500
 confirms as the benchmark for 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.070
 who is looking for performance style 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.620
 and a bit of technological redundancy a 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.560
 simpler product but not bad 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.480
 entering on tiptoe in the band 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.210
 cheaper than this segment and the 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:16.510
 calls and bt 09 tracer sly and shrewd is 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.700
 a 09 mt dressed as a tourist incidentally 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.710
 skillful move not to call her 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.030
 nothing on her hands and the ogr 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.280
 gladly to necochea reja but you know that 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.560
 I respect you a lot as a professional e 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.340
 as a surfer and you would try it for 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.810
 favor 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.850
 but I would be anxious to put them on 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.630
 also on what at the moment is only 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.910
 a concept or the honda to read it 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.610
 long awaited heir to africa twin e 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.100
 transalp should get the three 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.060
 versions from the best to the most 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.680
 pop 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.220
 3 developed around the twin cylinder 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.470
 it looks like 1000 cc front gear 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.169
 promise very well even if by the point 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.960
 from a stylistic point of view it is not very original 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.540
 here in my opinion these two are the bikes 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.280
 more interesting than euros but if you ask me 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.360
 with which I would escape for a getaway of 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.280
 cited madness 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.710
 well I'd answer the rc213v for today is 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.330
 all I know is the picture and eat but me 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.409
 I intend to return to general 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.289
 proposed 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.520
 but if you want this to happen remote control 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.129
 but it was n't there 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.590
 subscribers comment or video what you do 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.590
 want but let me know how the real hello
