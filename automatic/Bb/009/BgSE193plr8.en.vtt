now
are<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.700> major<00:05:35.880> source<00:05:36.300> of<00:05:36.480> funding<00:05:36.840> for<00:05:37.080> our

are the major source of funding for our
programs<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:38.510> certainly<00:05:39.510> we<00:05:39.720> be<00:05:39.930> going<00:05:40.230> at<00:05:40.350> a

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
programs and certainly we be going at a

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.700 
programs and certainly we be going at a
snails<00:05:41.310> pace<00:05:41.700> compared<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.570> what<00:05:42.750> we<00:05:42.900> are<00:05:43.080> now

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
snails pace compared to what we are now

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.770 
snails pace compared to what we are now
without<00:05:44.100> their<00:05:44.310> support<00:05:44.700> we're<00:05:45.360> really

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
without their support we're really

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.280 
without their support we're really
making<00:05:46.560> some<00:05:47.460> great<00:05:47.820> strides<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:48.780> it's<00:05:49.080> going

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
making some great strides and it's going

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.530 
making some great strides and it's going
to<00:05:49.380> be<00:05:49.530> extraordinary<00:05:49.890> because<00:05:50.550> I<00:05:50.790> am<00:05:51.390> NOT

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
to be extraordinary because I am NOT

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.120 
to be extraordinary because I am NOT
looking<00:05:51.690> at<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.110> as<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.350> marathon<00:05:52.920> but

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
looking at this as a marathon but

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.340 
looking at this as a marathon but
definitely<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:53.820> sprint<00:05:54.270> of<00:05:54.450> where<00:05:55.170> we'll<00:05:55.320> be

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
definitely a sprint of where we'll be

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.620 
definitely a sprint of where we'll be
even<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.160> next<00:05:56.430> three<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.760> five<00:05:56.970> years<00:05:57.030> it

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
even in the next three to five years it

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:13.060 
even in the next three to five years it
will<00:05:57.900> be<00:05:58.170> my<00:05:58.500> ears

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070
