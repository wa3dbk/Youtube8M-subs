00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:21.270 

I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:19.420> as<00:00:19.600> a<00:00:19.630> wayshower<00:00:19.930> with<00:00:20.470> sight<00:00:20.830> I'm

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 
I think as a wayshower with sight I'm

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.670 
I think as a wayshower with sight I'm
sure<00:00:21.490> you'll<00:00:21.670> probably<00:00:22.170> agree<00:00:23.170> with<00:00:23.529> this

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
sure you'll probably agree with this

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.519 
sure you'll probably agree with this
riser<00:00:23.980> when<00:00:24.789> you<00:00:24.910> look<00:00:25.150> at<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.480> population<00:00:25.660> on

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
riser when you look at the population on

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.960 
riser when you look at the population on
math<00:00:27.070> there<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.640> such<00:00:27.970> a<00:00:28.980> such<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.010> shifting<00:00:30.730> I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
math there is such a such a shifting I

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.590 
math there is such a such a shifting I
mean<00:00:31.330> previously<00:00:32.289> I<00:00:32.679> would<00:00:33.100> see<00:00:33.789> people<00:00:34.059> and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
mean previously I would see people and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.680 
mean previously I would see people and
you<00:00:35.079> could<00:00:35.260> see<00:00:35.469> clearly<00:00:35.829> where<00:00:36.129> they<00:00:36.429> were

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you could see clearly where they were

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.259 
you could see clearly where they were
because<00:00:37.690> time<00:00:38.350> was<00:00:38.649> different<00:00:39.159> then<00:00:39.609> so<00:00:40.210> you

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
because time was different then so you

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.729 
because time was different then so you
could<00:00:40.479> look<00:00:40.690> at<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.929> population<00:00:41.109> of<00:00:41.620> the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
could look at the population of the

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.739 
could look at the population of the
planet<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.249> see<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:43.030> people<00:00:43.359> in<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.569> light

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
planet and see the people in the light

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:45.329 
planet and see the people in the light
and<00:00:44.139> see<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.379> people<00:00:44.559> but<00:00:44.829> would<00:00:44.979> it<00:00:45.100> weren't

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
and see the people but would it weren't

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.610 
and see the people but would it weren't
and<00:00:45.699> see<00:00:45.879> but<00:00:46.329> when<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.659> look<00:00:46.989> now<00:00:47.319> at<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and see but when I look now at the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.309 
and see but when I look now at the
population<00:00:48.100> it's<00:00:48.429> moving<00:00:48.969> it's<00:00:49.449> moving<00:00:49.600> so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
population it's moving it's moving so

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.139 
population it's moving it's moving so
quickly<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.010> people<00:00:51.309> in<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.519> lights<00:00:51.760> and

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
quickly and the people in the lights and

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.779 
quickly and the people in the lights and
people<00:00:52.600> are<00:00:52.870> shifting<00:00:53.260> and<00:00:53.409> changing<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:54.069> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
well the timelines are all interweaving

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.560 
well the timelines are all interweaving
with<00:01:05.650> greater<00:01:05.980> force<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:10.300> like

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
with greater force and it is like

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.410 
with greater force and it is like
there's<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:11.730> constituency<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:13.000> that's

i<00:02:35.599> mean<00:02:35.780> thats<00:02:36.140> that's<00:02:36.650> exactly<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.819> same

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
i mean thats that's exactly the same

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.009 
i mean thats that's exactly the same
message<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.049> the<00:02:39.170> nine<00:02:39.379> spoke<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.519> me<00:02:40.700> about

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
message that the nine spoke to me about

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.370 
message that the nine spoke to me about
recently<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.940> know<00:02:44.090> previously<00:02:45.049> we

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
recently and that you know previously we

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.640 
recently and that you know previously we
would<00:02:45.560> see<00:02:45.890> oneness<00:02:46.819> as<00:02:47.090> an<00:02:47.540> illusion<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.440> we

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
would see oneness as an illusion that we

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.699 
would see oneness as an illusion that we
perhaps<00:02:49.180> understood<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.989> maybe<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.440> didn't

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
perhaps understood but maybe we didn't

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.729 
perhaps understood but maybe we didn't
feel<00:02:51.920> wholly<00:02:52.730> part<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.540> because<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.500> felt

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
feel wholly part of because we felt

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.520 
feel wholly part of because we felt
separation<00:02:55.670> as<00:02:55.910> we<00:02:56.360> were<00:02:56.540> existing<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.290> third

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
separation as we were existing in third

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.890 
separation as we were existing in third
density<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.060> really<00:02:59.299> seems<00:02:59.660> as

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
density and now it really seems as

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.009 
density and now it really seems as
though<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:01.099> separation<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.720> illusion

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
though the separation is the illusion

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.460 
though the separation is the illusion
and<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.239> channeling<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.260> nine

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
and in that in that channeling the nine

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.430 
and in that in that channeling the nine
said<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.760> 11<00:03:08.269> 11<00:03:08.599> energies<00:03:08.989> are<00:03:09.140> felt<00:03:09.349> by

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
said the the 11 11 energies are felt by

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.490 
said the the 11 11 energies are felt by
many<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.879> even<00:03:11.660> those<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.349> not

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
many and even those that have not

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.840 
many and even those that have not
awakened<00:03:13.750> consciously<00:03:14.769> are<00:03:15.769> seeing<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.489> 11

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
awakened consciously are seeing the 11

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.930 
awakened consciously are seeing the 11
11<00:03:17.180> signs<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.900> clocks<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.340> know<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
11 signs on clocks and you know the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.970 
11 signs on clocks and you know the
synchronicity<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> 11<00:03:21.260> 11<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.739> other

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
synchronicity of the 11 11 and other

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.740 
synchronicity of the 11 11 and other
master<00:03:22.489> numbers<00:03:22.819> are<00:03:22.940> coming<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.480> them

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
master numbers are coming to them

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.990 
master numbers are coming to them
opening<00:03:24.590> their<00:03:24.650> eyes<00:03:24.799> making<00:03:25.430> me<00:03:25.670> think<00:03:25.880> well

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
opening their eyes making me think well

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.660 
opening their eyes making me think well
what<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.359> this<00:03:26.599> what<00:03:26.840> am<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.079> saying<00:03:27.349> and<00:03:27.739> you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
what is this what am I saying and you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.520 
what is this what am I saying and you
know<00:03:28.790> there<00:03:29.180> is<00:03:29.209> such<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:29.599> great<00:03:29.870> shift<00:03:30.290> in

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
know there is such a great shift in

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.349 
know there is such a great shift in
going<00:03:30.799> on<00:03:30.859> now<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.310> it's<00:03:31.489> it's<00:03:31.819> such<00:03:32.329> a

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
going on now and it's it's such a

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.599 
going on now and it's it's such a
duality<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.139> emotion<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.889> think<00:03:34.130> for<00:03:34.310> all<00:03:34.430> the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
duality of emotion I think for all the

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.780 
duality of emotion I think for all the
way<00:03:34.730> show<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.209> because<00:03:35.660> it's<00:03:36.109> so<00:03:36.680> exciting<00:03:37.549> and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
way show is because it's so exciting and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.020 
way show is because it's so exciting and
it's<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.569> blissful<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.700> everything<00:03:40.700> we've

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
it's so blissful and everything we've

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.970 
it's so blissful and everything we've
always<00:03:41.209> known<00:03:41.569> deep<00:03:41.900> down<00:03:41.930> within<00:03:42.410> our<00:03:42.650> souls

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
always known deep down within our souls

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.909 
always known deep down within our souls
is<00:03:43.340> really<00:03:44.000> really<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:44.660> it's<00:03:45.410> not<00:03:45.620> something

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
is really really here it's not something

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.920 
is really really here it's not something
that's<00:03:46.190> in<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.549> future<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.299> now<00:03:47.660> and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
that's in the future is here now and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.879 
that's in the future is here now and
it's<00:03:48.079> here<00:03:48.410> evident<00:03:48.919> every<00:03:49.489> day<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:51.709> have

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
it's here evident every day and we have

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.059 
it's here evident every day and we have
a<00:03:51.970> responsibility<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.359> way<00:03:53.569> show<00:03:53.840> us<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.319> you

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
a responsibility of way show us and you

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.759 
a responsibility of way show us and you
know<00:03:55.099> we<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:56.030> embrace<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.109> it<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.739> be

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
know we we embrace that and it can be

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.870 
know we we embrace that and it can be
challenging<00:03:58.489> for<00:03:58.549> us<00:03:58.790> it's<00:03:59.269> also<00:03:59.480> beautiful

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
challenging for us it's also beautiful

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.020 
challenging for us it's also beautiful
so<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.799> thought<00:04:03.799> well<00:04:04.069> with<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> way<00:04:04.549> show<00:04:04.849> is

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
so I thought well with the way show is

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.120 
so I thought well with the way show is
right<00:04:05.329> now<00:04:05.540> because<00:04:06.230> they<00:04:06.470> are<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.620> ones<00:04:06.739> that

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
right now because they are the ones that

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.120 
right now because they are the ones that
will<00:04:07.459> lead<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.900> others<00:04:09.200> forward<00:04:09.709> they<00:04:10.010> are

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
will lead the others forward they are

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.710 
will lead the others forward they are
the<00:04:10.220> ones<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.519> are<00:04:10.730> going<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:11.000> lead<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.480> rest

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the ones that are going to lead the rest

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.930 
the ones that are going to lead the rest
of<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.169> planet<00:04:12.650> forward<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:13.250> show<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.760> way

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
of the planet forward and show the way

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.740 
of the planet forward and show the way
and<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.769> we<00:04:16.400> really<00:04:16.940> are<00:04:17.060> being<00:04:17.359> called<00:04:17.599> upon

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
and and we really are being called upon

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.349 
and and we really are being called upon
now<00:04:18.169> as<00:04:18.349> way<00:04:18.530> shows<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.310> do<00:04:19.430> our<00:04:19.579> job<00:04:19.909> and<00:04:20.150> I

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
now as way shows to do our job and I

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.540 
now as way shows to do our job and I
think<00:04:20.599> that's<00:04:20.780> that's<00:04:21.409> very<00:04:21.590> evident<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.520> all

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
think that's that's very evident to all

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.629 
think that's that's very evident to all
those<00:04:22.909> who<00:04:23.180> work

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
those who work

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.809 
those who work
in<00:04:23.939> a<00:04:24.479> way<00:04:24.930> show<00:04:25.169> at<00:04:25.319> capacity<00:04:25.620> that<00:04:26.069> we<00:04:26.129> really

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
in a way show at capacity that we really

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.570 
in a way show at capacity that we really
are<00:04:26.969> working<00:04:27.479> really<00:04:28.319> are<00:04:28.680> working<00:04:29.159> now<00:04:29.189> full

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
are working really are working now full

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.999 
are working really are working now full
time<00:04:31.550> yeah<00:04:32.550> there<00:04:33.300> seems<00:04:33.509> to<00:04:33.779> be<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.199> tremendous

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
time yeah there seems to be a tremendous

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.659 
time yeah there seems to be a tremendous
increase<00:04:35.669> in<00:04:36.349> the<00:04:37.349> amount<00:04:37.379> of<00:04:37.770> waking<00:04:38.400> time

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
increase in the amount of waking time

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.719 
increase in the amount of waking time
versus<00:04:39.240> sleeping<00:04:39.719> time<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:42.409> agree<00:04:43.409> I<00:04:43.439> agree<00:04:44.129> at

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
versus sleeping time I agree I agree at

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.439 
versus sleeping time I agree I agree at
some<00:04:45.620> there<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:46.979> much<00:04:47.159> to<00:04:47.400> do<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.939> find

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
some there is so much to do and I find

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.929 
some there is so much to do and I find
myself<00:04:48.689> thinking<00:04:49.229> well<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.310> know<00:04:50.490> what

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
myself thinking well you know what

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.700 
myself thinking well you know what
should<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.330> do<00:04:51.389> but<00:04:51.900> whenever<00:04:52.319> you<00:04:52.499> go<00:04:52.680> into

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710

whenever I go into this mode of how I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.029

planning out my day the nine show me
that's<00:05:05.460> not<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.699> way<00:05:05.879> to<00:05:05.909> do<00:05:06.180> this<00:05:06.389> anymore

that's not the way to do this anymore
it's<00:05:07.919> not<00:05:08.159> about<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.400> conscious<00:05:09.090> plan<00:05:09.539> of

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
it's not about a conscious plan of

to do this and the 4 o'clock we'll do a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.350 
to do this and the 4 o'clock we'll do a
video<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.400> then<00:05:14.520> i'll<00:05:14.639> do<00:05:14.759> some<00:05:14.879> channeling

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
video and then i'll do some channeling

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.219 
video and then i'll do some channeling
it's<00:05:15.599> about<00:05:16.560> aligning<00:05:16.949> with<00:05:17.279> them<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:18.229> making

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
it's about aligning with them and making

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.360 
it's about aligning with them and making
the<00:05:20.810> intention<00:05:21.810> known<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.319> them<00:05:22.589> of<00:05:22.889> the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
the intention known to them of the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.249 
the intention known to them of the
things<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.789> have<00:05:23.879> to<00:05:24.240> do<00:05:24.389> that<00:05:24.659> day<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:24.990> you

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
things you have to do that day and you

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.159 
things you have to do that day and you
can<00:05:25.409> do<00:05:25.529> this<00:05:25.650> on<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.830> day-to-day<00:05:26.599> process<00:05:27.599> and

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
can do this on a day-to-day process and

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.920 
can do this on a day-to-day process and
then<00:05:28.710> allowing<00:05:29.129> that<00:05:29.699> alignment<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.629> come

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
then allowing that alignment to come

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.740 
then allowing that alignment to come
from<00:05:31.319> them<00:05:31.529> and<00:05:31.800> too<00:05:31.919> slow<00:05:32.189> not<00:05:32.729> giving<00:05:33.659> it

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
from them and too slow not giving it

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.950 
from them and too slow not giving it
totally<00:05:34.409> to<00:05:34.589> them<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:35.099> your<00:05:35.339> passive<00:05:35.879> but<00:05:36.659> not

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
totally to them so your passive but not

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.899 
totally to them so your passive but not
you<00:05:37.439> being<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:37.979> one<00:05:38.099> that's<00:05:38.370> doing<00:05:38.520> at<00:05:38.699> all

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
you being the one that's doing at all

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.589 
you being the one that's doing at all
it's<00:05:39.240> a<00:05:39.360> real<00:05:40.009> 5050<00:05:41.009> than<00:05:41.550> working<00:05:41.819> between

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
it's a real 5050 than working between

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.899 
it's a real 5050 than working between
yourself<00:05:43.349> and<00:05:43.500> your<00:05:43.979> higher<00:05:44.219> guidance<00:05:44.520> so

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
yourself and your higher guidance so

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.450 
yourself and your higher guidance so
that<00:05:44.939> it<00:05:45.120> all<00:05:45.270> comes<00:05:45.509> together<00:05:46.310> that's<00:05:47.310> how

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
that it all comes together that's how

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.740 
that it all comes together that's how
it's<00:05:47.639> coming<00:05:47.909> and<00:05:48.089> that's<00:05:48.330> being<00:05:48.539> quite

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
it's coming and that's being quite

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.070 
it's coming and that's being quite
recent<00:05:49.199> for<00:05:50.009> me<00:05:50.159> it's<00:05:50.370> only<00:05:50.490> been<00:05:50.930> well<00:05:51.930> as

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
recent for me it's only been well as

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.110 
recent for me it's only been well as
we've<00:05:52.289> approached<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.860> 11<00:05:53.099> 11<00:05:53.399> today<00:05:53.550> that

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
we've approached the 11 11 today that

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.929 
we've approached the 11 11 today that
I've<00:05:54.240> found<00:05:54.750> this<00:05:55.080> 5050<00:05:56.069> alignment<00:05:56.610> with<00:05:56.759> them

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:56.939 
I've found this 5050 alignment with them

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.209 
I've found this 5050 alignment with them
and<00:05:57.089> learned<00:05:57.629> how<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.050> balance<00:05:58.409> myself<00:05:58.800> with

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
and learned how to balance myself with

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.029 
and learned how to balance myself with
that<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.789> I<00:06:00.180> think<00:06:00.449> the<00:06:01.080> way<00:06:01.259> show<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.770> that's

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
that and I think the way show is that's

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.860 
that and I think the way show is that's
where<00:06:02.250> we're<00:06:02.430> all<00:06:02.460> moving<00:06:02.789> into<00:06:03.210> now<00:06:03.449> so<00:06:03.719> that

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
where we're all moving into now so that

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.369 
where we're all moving into now so that
everything<00:06:04.289> we<00:06:04.740> do<00:06:05.069> as<00:06:05.460> we<00:06:05.969> lead<00:06:06.210> others<00:06:06.659> comes

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
everything we do as we lead others comes

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.029 
everything we do as we lead others comes
from<00:06:07.710> ourselves<00:06:07.949> as<00:06:08.939> the<00:06:09.210> human<00:06:09.719> up<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.560> it

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
from ourselves as the human up and it

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.070 
from ourselves as the human up and it
equally<00:06:11.669> comes<00:06:12.000> from<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.360> Higher<00:06:12.539> Self<00:06:12.899> and

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
equally comes from the Higher Self and

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.129 
equally comes from the Higher Self and
we're<00:06:13.649> always<00:06:13.919> working<00:06:14.479> with<00:06:15.479> both<00:06:15.839> those

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
we're always working with both those

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.439 
we're always working with both those
places<00:06:16.199> of<00:06:16.800> ourselves<00:06:16.949> as<00:06:17.460> we<00:06:17.639> lead<00:06:17.819> the

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
places of ourselves as we lead the

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:20.570 
places of ourselves as we lead the
others<00:06:18.779> and<00:06:18.990> everything<00:06:19.620> therefore<00:06:20.339> comes

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
others and everything therefore comes

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.769 
others and everything therefore comes
from<00:06:20.729> us<00:06:20.909> we<00:06:21.719> are<00:06:21.899> doing<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.379> as<00:06:22.529> human<00:06:22.949> and

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779 
from us we are doing it as human and

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.260 
from us we are doing it as human and
they<00:06:24.779> are<00:06:25.110> doing<00:06:25.349> it<00:06:25.620> as<00:06:25.830> our<00:06:26.279> hire<00:06:26.550> guides<00:06:26.879> and

challenge to find that balance but when

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:36.610 
challenge to find that balance but when
you<00:06:35.610> do<00:06:35.819> then

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
you do then
