00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
in half and it's going to give us the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.150 
in half and it's going to give us the
yeah<00:00:51.780> clear<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.750> five-star<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.739> shows<00:00:56.039> how

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
yeah clear in a five-star it shows how

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.029 
yeah clear in a five-star it shows how
much<00:00:56.280> percent<00:00:56.699> each<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> pieces<00:00:58.289> were<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
much percent each of the pieces were so

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
much percent each of the pieces were so
we<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> next<00:00:59.520> stage<00:00:59.699> um<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:01.079> little<00:01:01.559> triangle

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
we go to next stage um a little triangle
