00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 hello everyone welcome for this new 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.480
 tutorial to dj music art 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.520
 so yes we have been slow to 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.900
 post new tutorial it's true but 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.340
 we had a good reason for that in 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.680
 work we were changing so 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.930
 of establishment we will post 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.640
 by the way about this a soon a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.349
 video I think pretty quickly and he 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.399
 will allow you to present its 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.290
 new premises so that you 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.980
 can see our magnificent new 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.579
 work tool 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.050
 it will soon be here then our 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.280
 tutorials will now be called the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.690
 Chronic sole will be available 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.730
 so on the site 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.410
 under this name so do not forget the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.540
 salt chronicle you can besides 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.340
 post all your requests 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.920
 possibly questions about 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.020
 tutorials so future tutorial to 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.520
 come especially always scratch 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.050
 since we asked them so we're going 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.489
 continue there again on this tutorial 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.380
 today there will be more 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.360
 certainly in mixing and maybe and 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.560
 maybe obviously the malraux 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.720
 since we are enormously 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.869
 a lot of requests in this area 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.030
 Here then are today as promised 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.280
 continue the scratch tutorials with 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.810
 today a technique a little bit 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.759
 advanced so-called flair 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.560
 today so the flair we go so 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.179
 I explain it to you quickly then 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 it will obviously have to work a lot 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.259
 at home to take out this technique 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.299
 slightly we will not say slightly 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.159
 it is a little bit difficult of course 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.840
 but it just takes work so 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.780
 I explain a reference as 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.520
 usually at the beginning of the sound that's for 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.520
 symbolize the departure a landmark for 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.740
 symbolize the end of are so lesson 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.340
 stop here 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.479
 I hope it's clear for everyone 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.819
 world a landmark for the attack is a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.689
 landmark to symbolize the end of the sound 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.670
 just what will happen if I have 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.799
 added a little reference in the middle of 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.569
 sound so as to define the area of 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.179
 cut because the flair makes it into 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.340
 reality will create a break in the middle 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.509
 of are so we're going to get 200 I 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.759
 reminds us that we are still 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.189
 faded crossfire forgive excuse me 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.259
 open one part open crossfire and that 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.729
 it is important 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.140
 so we are at the sound attack we 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.530
 let's send our sound and create a 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.790
 cut that ting psychiatrist in the middle of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.240
 scion so as to separate it into two one 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.280
 are we of course the difference that 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.280
 it is well tac tac I start again 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 unlike that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 the years obviously only hear one 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.099
 meaning we go there now I hope toulouse 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.030
 hear well so we get two so 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.480
 sense the goal is to do it on the go 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.090
 and back 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.909
 so in terms of forward scratch and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:59.220
 backward we go there a lot to go 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:03:00.540
 so and backward back ok here 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.319
 I hope it's very clear but I 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.400
 will you do something a little 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.560
 little faster for you to have a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 idea in the head of what it gives 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.849
 here is the flair so I start again 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.919
 pass one more time 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.900
 then it's up to you to work a 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.099
 marker placed at the beginning of the attacked 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.250
 its you can simulate it on our 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.040
 turntables cd j with just just laid 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 a crazy act from the sound of course 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780
 CDJ turntables on the type or another one 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.109
 could not actually posed any 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.500
 additional benchmarks but good little 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.030
 imported 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.040
 No, I recap, we start the attack 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.079
 of the sound the little reindeer blush he goes 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.079
 simulate cutting the cut in the middle 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:54.019
 of sound so as to get 200 that's it and 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.019
 on the return we start again one way 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.180
 here we go to see what that gives with a 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.180
 beat 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.010
 I call back a softly at the start 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.450
 what matters is not to go fast 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.010
 it's going slowly but well 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.380
 then do it gradually 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.700
 to speed up so not get 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.700
 something more radical 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.679
 ah ah 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.330
 I'm going but it's a little bit the instru 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.750
 so that you can hear better 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.750
 the scratch 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.539
 what 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.910
 ah ah 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.800
 as you can see the crossfire him 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.360
 advance to the eighth to hollywood musical 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.259
 we can see that he goes every time in 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.259
 time and in the crooked 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.750
 that's obviously you're working on that 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.340
 at home at home go slowly to 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.350
 departure and then we accelerate 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.920
 obviously speeds up the faster 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.920
 then the pretty ones 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.840
 here are the friends more than work for 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.250
 you I hope the explanation was 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.050
 clear enough so you can find 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.750
 this tutorial on the youtube channel of 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.210
 the school also on the school site 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.620
 facebook page obviously and all 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.870
 social networks do not hesitate to me 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.820
 leave your comment especially on my 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.020
 new chronicle and sap and ask 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.330
 your questions if I have time to 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.620
 answer obviously I 'll do it here we go 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.310
 so is very soon for a 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.310
 next tut ocha
