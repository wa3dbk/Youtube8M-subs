00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
by the duct tape here so I figured I'll

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.700 
by the duct tape here so I figured I'll
do<00:00:17.190> an<00:00:17.310> unboxing<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:21.320> alright<00:00:22.320> let's<00:00:22.350> open

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
do an unboxing of it alright let's open

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.640
