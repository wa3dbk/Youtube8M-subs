00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.390
 It does not have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 Yes I Mutsumu Hello everybody saint feature 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.820
 Everyday I use my youtube channel and water cass 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.890
 Thank you 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:24.190
 The Fablet to view this time is here Yes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.290
 apple ipad mini 3 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:32.710
 If you are considering the purchase of tablets now and you are in the grain 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:38.050
 I think if you can refer to it before purchasing 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 From I think first of all it is in spec and immediately Do not want to perform the terminal review in 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.059
 I will introduce 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.180
 The part cpu that corresponds to the brain of the tablet is 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.500
 64-bit 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 It is because it is equipped with apple a 7 processor of 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:58.590
 It has the same cpu as the previous model ipad mini 2 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.590
 Memory is like Ram is 1 gb, so Apple products are like 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 I think if I have a sense of uniqueness I may not operate comfortably enough 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.540
 Yes 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:15.070
 The screen size is 7.9 inches 2048 times 1536 . 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.240
 It is equipped with a high-definition display 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.659
 Camera can shoot 5 million pixels full hd video 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.460
 Equipped with Sony of a high-quality camera 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.049
 Yes 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.800
 It is a feeling of the size of the body, but when compared with iphone 6 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.910
 Yes i feel like this 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.780
 Naturally, ipad mini 3 is bigger but 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:45.030
 Because to say yes Togitsu 7.9 inches 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.630
 Well yes it is a compact finish of course than a 10-inch tablet 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 I am 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.670
 So Tsumutsumu also hope that it will be very kana not it easy to play 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.990
 There is nothing here, but compared with the previous model ipad mini 2 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.759
 There is little difference in the size performance 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 If you dare to say something different, this is a fingerprint authentication function 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:15.200
 I think it's about entering this or not 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:20.540
 By the way, this model does not support removal of the battery 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.980
 Yes , I think that I want to play Tsum Tsum right away with specs around here 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.069
 think 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.750
 This time too It is the same as the previous terminal reviews 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:32.730
 The pre-installed app is just as it is bought in the state you bought 3 of 3 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.819
 I will install and play 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.200
 Though it is the first rice this time 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.950
 It is one bird 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 it's here 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.650
 Yes 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:53.799
 We use super high We do not put protective film of screen 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:59.260
 Yes gaps between the comfortable Come with the One is often pointed out after I Is apple products this time 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.010
 It seems like I think I want to play with the new usual McQueen to make sure 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.180
 I will 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.750
 Something around that also overlap tie-friendliness and the pungent of time to come back speed and chain 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.640
 is not it 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.420
 Please pay attention to it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.420
 Will start 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.170
 We can operate math comfortably 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.720
 2 speed to piano 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.720
 It is normal that it seemed so- 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:52.420
 After all compared with that android 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.710
 That skimmer is absolutely 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.710
 There is a point to be worried about 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:03.249
 Well because the movement itself is comfortable- 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.510
 Where do you get used to this gap 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.410
 I wonder if Honda is not 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.410
 I feel like that 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:50.659
 Yes I know impression I have to play it is not that er but was still comfortable 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:55.490
 Yes Tsubonouchi come speed also It should not be a worry too much 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:57.660
 It is not overall I think it was not very comfortable this week 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.910
 I also say that during the play 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.020
 However, regarding gaps, I think that it will affect the ease of connecting that chain too 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:09.210
 Because 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:12.139
 discomfort first is when it is change to the product of You're Oh Pu Lou towards the android 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.150
 I feel that there is no 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:19.290
 Yes overall it was very comfortable 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:22.620
 Yes, so this is the ipad mini 3 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.970
 There is not much change with the last model 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:30.000
 As I was able to operate quite comfortably for the play of my last wife 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:35.169
 I felt that Well Naa's truly Apple products 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.090
 It feels like there is quite a sense of stability Oh yes compact 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:41.600

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:46.670
