to put them on when I use them on low
powered<00:00:27.599> flash<00:00:28.259> tubes<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> repeat<00:00:30.269> low

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:30.479 
powered flash tubes now I repeat low

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.799 
powered flash tubes now I repeat low
power<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.019> only<00:00:31.289> 200<00:00:31.800> watts<00:00:32.600> they<00:00:33.600> won't

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
power this is only 200 watts they won't

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.250 
power this is only 200 watts they won't
melt<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.980> plastic<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> tube<00:00:36.079> more<00:00:37.079> than

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
melt the plastic to the tube more than

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.400 
melt the plastic to the tube more than
three<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.680> 400<00:00:37.890> watts<00:00:38.340> see<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.269> plastic<00:00:40.050> will

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
three or 400 watts see the plastic will

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.310 
three or 400 watts see the plastic will
start<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> melt<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> your<00:00:42.090> Flash<00:00:42.300> tubes<00:00:42.600> then

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
start to melt to your Flash tubes then

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.259 
start to melt to your Flash tubes then
you'll<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.769> with<00:00:43.829> green<00:00:44.370> flash<00:00:44.760> tubes<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
you'll end up with green flash tubes and

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.169 
you'll end up with green flash tubes and
you<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.019> that<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:47.010> I've<00:00:47.250> made<00:00:47.519> up<00:00:47.699> a

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
you don't want that but I've made up a

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.829 
you don't want that but I've made up a
bunch<00:00:48.359> of<00:00:48.750> different<00:00:48.870> colors<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> use

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
bunch of different colors that I use

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.470 
bunch of different colors that I use
greens<00:00:51.839> yellows<00:00:52.079> blues<00:00:53.149> Browns<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

greens yellows blues Browns and
different<00:00:55.079> colors<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.940> basically<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
different colors and I the basically the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.099 
different colors and I the basically the
way<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.839> use<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.589> turn<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:58.980> around<00:01:00.109> so

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
way I use them is I turn them around so

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
way I use them is I turn them around so
that<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.589> flash<00:01:01.859> against<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that they can flash against the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
that they can flash against the
background<00:01:02.999> and<00:01:03.510> create<00:01:04.379> colors<00:01:04.800> on<00:01:05.040> my

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
