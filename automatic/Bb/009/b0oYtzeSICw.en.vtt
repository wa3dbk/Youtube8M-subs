iPod iPad connects to the radio and then

the way it mounts in just slides in so

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.049 
the way it mounts in just slides in so
it<00:01:00.440> acts<00:01:00.589> just<00:01:00.680> like<00:01:00.890> regular<00:01:01.100> iPad<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:02.000> know

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
it acts just like regular iPad you know

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.079 
it acts just like regular iPad you know
doing<00:01:02.420> all<00:01:02.480> your<00:01:02.629> regular<00:01:02.720> iPad<00:01:03.229> stuff<00:01:04.089> hit

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.120 
doing all your regular iPad stuff hit
your<00:01:05.239> app<00:01:05.390> remote<00:01:05.830> function<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.010> then

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
your app remote function and then

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.850 
your app remote function and then
suddenly<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.640> control<00:01:08.060> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.690> radio<00:01:08.990> so

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
suddenly it's in control of the radio so

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.990 
suddenly it's in control of the radio so
you<00:01:09.890> can<00:01:10.159> hit<00:01:10.310> your<00:01:10.520> tuner<00:01:10.909> go<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.870> radio<00:01:12.229> and

up volume down we got C cup seat down
preset<00:01:24.140> up<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:24.440> then<00:01:24.530> we<00:01:24.590> can<00:01:24.740> change<00:01:24.920> sources

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
preset up and then we can change sources

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.240

there and you can do your Pandora you
can<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.600> mean<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.140> anything<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.800> do

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
so it's pretty cool lot of work but I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.600 
so it's pretty cool lot of work but I
think<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.830> pays<00:02:23.190> off

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
think it's it pays off

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.010
