00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.009
 mind is divided into the conscious part and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.900
 during a day or throughout our 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.960
 life and the conscious part and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.210
 subconscious in the part of the mind in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.580
 which beliefs have been generated have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 generated habits have been generated 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.170
 customs the part of the mind 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.780
 subconscious receives everything that the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 conscious mind and it tells you inside the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 subconscious mind those are generated 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.879
 you behave those habits those those 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 emotions deeply rooted in the most 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.109
 deep inside 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 now I want to say something the real 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.090
 why I get fat and because of the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.760
 that you want to gain weight is for your 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.699
 subconscious mind has I mean 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.600
 because this kind of behaviors anxieties 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.700
 phobias eating disorders 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.189
 bipolarity and all that kind of emotions 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.610
 generates inside the subconscious mind by 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.079
 which is already anchored is already 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.390
 predetermined and a behavior is generated 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.520
 very strong very analyze through the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 years through our life I put him 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.979
 an example when you send sad 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.710
 because I fell in love I leave it or I finish it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.079
 with you or ended the relationship you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.899
 generated a kind of behavior every time 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.759
 that you felt sad at night you 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.289
 with your chocolates goods that already 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.899
 sleep at that time but the day 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.569
 next in the morning I get it wrong 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.970
 happy but in the night again 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.979
 it generated that memory inside his mind 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.009
 subconscious and what happened with the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 sorrow his mind and remembered what 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.509
 had passed and a 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.610
 anchor that of eating chocolates in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.670
 that moment then I want to tell you 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.700
 every time you felt sad you 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 I felt desolate for remembering that moment 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.459
 so ugly his subconscious mind brought him 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.160
 to the memory that you should consume 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.769
 chocolate at that time because the only 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.760
 way to fill that void that I had 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.549
 inside you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.159
 and because for a moment of happiness and 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.379
 how was eating chocolate in 270 and 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.439

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.170
 idea then a link one more connection 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.000
 that faith as the anchor every time 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.129

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.010

 everything we see in mind 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.799
 subconscious which is already anchored and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 receives all the information that he lives from 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.120
 part of the conscious mind the mind 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.040
