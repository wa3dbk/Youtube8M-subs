from what we've seen on the field talk

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.989 
from what we've seen on the field talk
about<00:00:57.649> that<00:00:57.799> dynamic<00:00:57.979> among<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.639> assistant

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
I think the dynamics of our staff has

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.929 
I think the dynamics of our staff has
helped<00:01:03.649> everything<00:01:04.189> they're<00:01:04.489> come<00:01:04.759> together

that was that a function of trying just
learning<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.540> new<00:01:35.660> system<00:01:35.990> for<00:01:36.050> these<00:01:36.260> kids<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
learning a new system for these kids and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.810 
learning a new system for these kids and
then<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.830> kind<00:01:36.980> of<00:01:37.070> clicked<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:37.430> after<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.790> I

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
then it kind of clicked in after that I

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.700 
then it kind of clicked in after that I
think<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.300> was<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.450> function<00:01:38.810> number<00:01:39.410> one

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
think it was a function number one

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.640 
think it was a function number one
anytime<00:01:40.300> when<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.420> go<00:01:41.600> out<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.470> people

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
all of a sudden they surprise you with

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.230 
all of a sudden they surprise you with
something<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:49.040> you're<00:01:49.250> not<00:01:49.280> ready<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:50.030> it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
something and you're not ready for it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.820 
something and you're not ready for it
and<00:01:50.360> then<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.960> next<00:01:51.229> thing<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.440> know<00:01:51.590> one

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
and then the next thing you know one

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.620 
and then the next thing you know one
thing<00:01:52.100> leads<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.430> another<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.240> answer<00:01:53.479> your
