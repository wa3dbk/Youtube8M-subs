the door just to make sure that the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.630 
the door just to make sure that the
system<00:01:08.070> fully<00:01:08.280> shuts<00:01:08.549> down<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> does

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
system fully shuts down which it does

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.870 
system fully shuts down which it does
put<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> key<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> ignition

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
starting the car and going to see if it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.770 
starting the car and going to see if it
connects<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:21.960> phone

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.500 

now<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.830> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> iPhone<00:01:33.000> did

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
now you can see that the iPhone did

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.020 
now you can see that the iPhone did
connect<00:01:33.930> properly<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.619> time<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.790> some

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
connect properly that time for some

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
connect properly that time for some
apparent<00:01:36.600> reason<00:01:36.960> although<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.040> didn't

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
apparent reason although it didn't

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.350 
apparent reason although it didn't
connect<00:01:39.060> properly<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:39.780> time<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:41.360> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
connect properly the first time so you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.730 
connect properly the first time so you
know<00:01:42.450> again<00:01:42.900> I<00:01:42.960> shouldn't<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> add<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.700 
know again I shouldn't have to add a
device<00:01:44.540> for<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> device<00:01:45.900> it's<00:01:46.140> already<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
with the system where sometimes it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.510 
with the system where sometimes it
connects<00:01:52.320> properly<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.920> sometimes<00:01:53.340> it

feature<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.369> today's<00:02:02.640> cars<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.380> people

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
feature in today's cars so that people
