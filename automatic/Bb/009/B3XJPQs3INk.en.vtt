00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
pace I think it is also likely we won't

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.300 
pace I think it is also likely we won't
be<00:04:04.700> seeing<00:04:05.000> high<00:04:05.269> tech<00:04:05.540> labs<00:04:05.870> or<00:04:06.170> viruses<00:04:06.799> but

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
be seeing high tech labs or viruses but

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.430 
be seeing high tech labs or viruses but

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
most if not all the game players will

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.010 
most if not all the game players will
also<00:05:10.130> eventually<00:05:10.310> have<00:05:10.730> access<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.480> classic

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
also eventually have access to a classic

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.020 
also eventually have access to a classic
shotgun<00:05:12.560> which<00:05:13.070> should<00:05:13.370> help<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.790> fighting

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
shotgun which should help in fighting

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.840 
shotgun which should help in fighting
larger<00:05:14.540> hordes<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:14.960> enemies<00:05:15.590> stealth<00:05:16.370> also

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
larger hordes and enemies stealth also

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.490 
larger hordes and enemies stealth also
seems<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.150> play<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.390> role<00:05:17.660> in<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.020> evil<00:05:18.350> within

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
seems to play a role in the evil within

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.770 
seems to play a role in the evil within
as<00:05:18.890> can<00:05:19.430> be<00:05:19.460> witnessed<00:05:19.820> in<00:05:20.240> this<00:05:20.450> screenshot

as can be witnessed in this screenshot
hopefully<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:21.950> means<00:05:22.130> players<00:05:22.520> can

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
hopefully this means players can

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.880 
hopefully this means players can
