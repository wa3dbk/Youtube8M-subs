at<00:02:01.340> one<00:02:02.119> issue<00:02:02.390> though<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.869> that<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.350> look

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
like a deal breaker or anything but

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.460 
like a deal breaker or anything but
still<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.389> kind<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.810> wonder<00:04:42.960> about<00:04:43.229> some<00:04:43.380> of

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
still you kind of wonder about some of

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.990 
still you kind of wonder about some of
the<00:04:43.530> other<00:04:43.680> small<00:04:44.039> details<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:44.729> they<00:04:44.820> took

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
the other small details that they took

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.200 
the other small details that they took
care<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.600> actually<00:04:46.470> carve<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.220> paint<00:04:47.669> and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
care to actually carve and paint and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.330 
care to actually carve and paint and
sculpt<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:48.900> for<00:04:49.470> some<00:04:49.620> reason<00:04:49.889> on<00:04:50.010> this<00:04:50.130> they

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
sculpt and for some reason on this they

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.890 
sculpt and for some reason on this they
just<00:04:50.580> look<00:04:51.000> at<00:04:51.120> stake<00:04:52.820> he<00:04:53.820> overall<00:04:54.270> has<00:04:54.510> a<00:04:54.539> nice

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
just look at stake he overall has a nice

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200 
just look at stake he overall has a nice
look<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.560> again<00:04:56.220> fits<00:04:56.550> well<00:04:56.789> with<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:56.940> rest

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
look and again fits well with the rest

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.920 
look and again fits well with the rest
of<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.419> six-inch<00:04:57.870> Mortal<00:04:58.200> Kombat<00:04:58.620> line<00:04:59.930> now

bottom of their feet to stand on

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.140 
bottom of their feet to stand on
character<00:05:05.100> stands<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.669> still<00:05:05.880> usually

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
character stands you can still usually

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.909 
character stands you can still usually
find<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.780> right<00:05:06.960> balance<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.560> make<00:05:07.710> them

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
find the right balance to make them

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.100 
find the right balance to make them
stand<00:05:08.190> up<00:05:08.340> in<00:05:08.550> some<00:05:08.760> pretty<00:05:08.940> good<00:05:09.150> poses<00:05:09.660> as

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
stand up in some pretty good poses as

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.240 
stand up in some pretty good poses as
long<00:05:10.349> as<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.530> get<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.710> feet<00:05:10.889> far<00:05:11.099> enough

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
long as you get the feet far enough

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.940 
long as you get the feet far enough
apart<00:05:11.450> however<00:05:12.450> if<00:05:12.720> you<00:05:12.840> want<00:05:13.020> them<00:05:13.229> perhaps

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
apart however if you want them perhaps

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.650 
apart however if you want them perhaps
falling<00:05:14.190> backwards<00:05:14.669> from<00:05:14.789> being<00:05:15.000> punched<00:05:15.300> or

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
falling backwards from being punched or

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.390 
falling backwards from being punched or
leaning<00:05:16.169> back<00:05:16.349> as<00:05:16.530> they're<00:05:16.710> throwing<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.130> kick

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
leaning back as they're throwing a kick

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.800 
leaning back as they're throwing a kick
then<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.270> be<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.389> little<00:05:18.690> more

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
then you have to be a little more

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.260 
then you have to be a little more
creative<00:05:19.050> like<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.800> don't<00:05:20.070> know<00:05:20.340> maybe<00:05:20.550> leaning

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
creative like I don't know maybe leaning

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.879 
creative like I don't know maybe leaning
them<00:05:21.479> up<00:05:21.599> against<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.050> back<00:05:22.229> of<00:05:22.470> your<00:05:22.590> photo

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
them up against the back of your photo

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.610 
them up against the back of your photo
tent<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.880> seems<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> work<00:05:24.360> pretty<00:05:24.389> well<00:05:24.660> but

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
tent that seems to work pretty well but

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.529 
tent that seems to work pretty well but
again<00:05:25.860> overall<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.370> didn't<00:05:26.940> really<00:05:27.120> expect<00:05:27.389> to

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
again overall I didn't really expect to

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.240
