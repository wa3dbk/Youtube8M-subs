piping here you can see there we've got

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.510 
piping here you can see there we've got
the<00:00:37.570> valley<00:00:37.720> pass<00:00:37.960> valve<00:00:38.230> off<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.800> car<00:00:39.040> we're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
the valley pass valve off the car we're

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.910 
the valley pass valve off the car we're
just<00:00:39.730> about<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.970> start<00:00:40.149> taking<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.140> apart<00:00:41.230> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
just about to start taking it apart the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.310 
just about to start taking it apart the
first<00:00:42.160> step<00:00:42.399> is<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.300> use<00:00:43.329> your<00:00:43.720> snap<00:00:44.050> ring

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
first step is to use your snap ring

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
first step is to use your snap ring
pliers<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:45.510> remove<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:47.500> ring<00:00:47.800> right<00:00:47.950> there

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
the snap ring proved to be somewhat of a

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.130 
the snap ring proved to be somewhat of a
challenge<00:00:54.610> but<00:00:54.879> after<00:00:55.360> some<00:00:55.540> finagling<00:00:55.840> we

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
challenge but after some finagling we

challenge but after some finagling we
were<00:00:56.230> able<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.440> get<00:00:57.430> it<00:00:57.550> loose<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.210> you<00:00:58.660> can

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
were able to get it loose and you can

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.960 
were able to get it loose and you can
see<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.050> we<00:00:59.170> got<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.320> top<00:00:59.649> part<00:01:00.070> off<00:01:00.220> and<00:01:00.550> now

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
we're going to continue to disassembly

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.330 
we're going to continue to disassembly
and<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.239> can<00:01:04.449> see<00:01:04.690> we've<00:01:05.199> taken<00:01:06.159> it
