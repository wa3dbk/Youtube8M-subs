00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
snow's actually compacted a little

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.750 
snow's actually compacted a little
because<00:05:14.180> we<00:05:14.330> had<00:05:14.450> 16<00:05:14.990> before<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.770> even<00:05:16.550> though

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
because we had 16 before and even though

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.260 
because we had 16 before and even though
more<00:05:16.970> came<00:05:17.270> down<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.930> snow<00:05:18.169> must<00:05:18.530> have

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
more came down the snow must have

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.260 
more came down the snow must have
compacted<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.419> now<00:05:20.660> it<00:05:20.840> only<00:05:20.930> looks<00:05:21.260> like<00:05:21.440> 15

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
compacted and now it only looks like 15

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.480 
compacted and now it only looks like 15
so<00:05:23.270> that's<00:05:23.479> about<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.870> for<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.410> storm<00:05:24.800> it's<00:05:25.280> a

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
so that's about it for this storm it's a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:35.450 
so that's about it for this storm it's a
wrap

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:06:04.530 

you

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.540
