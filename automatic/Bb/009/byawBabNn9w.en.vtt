00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 you often have to wipe off the stove 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.220
 run away unagi 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.670
 and then boil the broth for a long time at a slow 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.370
 on fire you are sick of seemingly escaped milk 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 then try cooking with a lid and not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 soldering is a real breakthrough 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
 kitchen tech silicone cover 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.859
 don't go soldering 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 arranged in such a way that the penny 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 raging stream goes to the top of the lid 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
 through special petals 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 leaving the hob dry and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 clean al do you even imagine what 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 mean for every modern mistress 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.989
 Here is such a purchase does not cover 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.000
 howl and solder 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 I just saw this mug today 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.649
 already realized how much it will simplify our 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.480
 life well, but for those who have not figured it out yet 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.070
 what a wonderful subject today 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.760
 will be discussed and of course for you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 my dear 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 I asked to cook 5 pans in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.160
 which products are brewed 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 properties boil away or as our say 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.539
 dear housewives run away so i have 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.180
 here peas are cooking the risk of pasta 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.370
 dumplings and even milk is the word type is not this 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 awful it is dirty dishes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 it's a dirty pot a dirty stove a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 if boiling broth or milk boils then 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.670
 have to boil again nothing 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 come to brew my dear again if 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.510
 there will be no cover in your kitchen 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 pile to you just think about the title 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.549
 the cap does not come out soldering and thats why she 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.590
 don't bend it i'll tell you now 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 the cover is made of high strength 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.150
 silicone but most importantly inside her 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 here are these petals and now carefully 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.930
 see how it works my friends 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 when you put the lid on the pot in 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.560
 which something is boiling foaming flow 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.950
 rises up passes through 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.290
 petals and settles inside the cover itself 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 fiction extra foam now under 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.430
 currency control probably with the fact that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.829
 brewed inside the pan even on the most 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.899
 high temperatures continues to boil 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.689
 without your participation you no longer need 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.180
 follow the process but this is not the most 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.490
 the most important thing is that in the sky cover 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.260
 a pile of kai in your kitchen will always be 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.760
 purely 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.190
 for those who want to keep cooking 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.160
 the surface is clean for those who are forced 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.810
 leave the stove unattended 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.870
 annoying overflow more 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 won't bother you whatever u 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.979
 you cooked on the stove everything stays in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.330
 pan and cooks to the maximum 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.420
 possible temperature 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.130
 saving you time and energy here we are 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.900
 you have been here for about ten minutes 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.270
 something boils we talk well you 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
 not at all sitting behind the process of foam not 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.650
 ravil on but the process is under control 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.750
 lids do not pour out but if you darling 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 my think that this is all capable of 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.430
 this is a miracle cover I'll surprise you now how 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 do you think that here I am preparing in 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 this steamed shrimp is my favorite dish 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.030
 but I prepared them with the help of all that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.070
 the covers are not in these stories I took the pan 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.020
 with water brought it to a boil top 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.370
 put the lid not you bore q on it and 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.650
 put the products I want 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.470
 steam and cover the usual 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.540
 the lid is amazing but that 's not all 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.860
 the cap does not come out soldering is perfect 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.690
 for frying in a pan on a vegetable 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.670
 oil you ever 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.010
 burned with boiling oil to very 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 it would be unpleasant to even say hurt so 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 it's all in the past first cover it 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 Hi Banya keep temperature 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.600
 inside the pan and will not allow the oil 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 splatter you said that the silicone cap 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.250
 cancer and we love silicone in the kitchen 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.530
 because it is not at all harmful and durable 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.780
 flexible and very well cleaned either under 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.550
 tap either with a dishwasher and more 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.350
 silicone is resistant to even the highest 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.570
 temperatures he keeps his 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.019
 fantastic temperature properties 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.610
 up to 260 degrees which means that the lid 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.739
 don't get out the bike will do its 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.720
