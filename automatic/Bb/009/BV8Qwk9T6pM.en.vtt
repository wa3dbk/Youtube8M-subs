what<00:03:09.330> engines<00:03:09.930> would<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.620> find<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
what engines would you find in in in a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.449 
what engines would you find in in in a
pulse<00:03:12.690> oh<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> first<00:03:14.010> ones<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
pulse oh the that the first ones that

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.839 
pulse oh the that the first ones that
were<00:03:14.580> produced<00:03:14.790> were<00:03:15.239> 400<00:03:15.780> Yamaha<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.849> they

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
were produced were 400 Yamaha and they

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.539 
were produced were 400 Yamaha and they
quickly<00:03:18.209> found<00:03:18.599> out<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.200> air-cooled<00:03:19.739> didn't

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
quickly found out that air-cooled didn't

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.120 
quickly found out that air-cooled didn't
cut<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.880> because<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> overheating<00:03:22.500> you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
cut it because of the overheating you

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.800 
cut it because of the overheating you
notice<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.940> engine<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.420> completely

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
notice that the engine is completely

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.500 
notice that the engine is completely
sealed<00:03:25.410> so<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.549> they<00:03:26.730> had<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.030> go<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.269> the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
sealed so then they had to go to the

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.569 
sealed so then they had to go to the
water<00:03:27.870> cooled<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.560> they<00:03:28.709> decided<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
water cooled and they decided on the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.830 
water cooled and they decided on the
honda<00:03:29.970> goldwing<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.260> this<00:03:32.160> is<00:03:32.310> about<00:03:32.840> 1981-82

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
honda goldwing and this is about 1981-82

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.830 
honda goldwing and this is about 1981-82
and<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.519> that's<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.120> one<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.420> they<00:03:36.599> chose

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and so that's the one that they chose

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.100 
and so that's the one that they chose
and<00:03:37.200> they<00:03:37.260> used<00:03:37.440> ether<00:03:37.620> 1100<00:03:38.489> or<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> 1200<00:03:39.660> and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
and they used ether 1100 or the 1200 and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.410 
and they used ether 1100 or the 1200 and
their<00:03:40.290> water<00:03:40.500> cooled<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:41.970> look<00:03:42.090> at<00:03:42.329> the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
their water cooled so as you look at the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.729 
their water cooled so as you look at the
vehicle<00:03:42.870> there's<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.170> little<00:03:43.379> radiator

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
vehicle there's a little radiator

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.220 
vehicle there's a little radiator
sticking<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.700> side<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.780> say<00:03:46.019> there

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
sticking out on the side you say there

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.759 
sticking out on the side you say there
was<00:03:46.379> around<00:03:46.680> 300<00:03:47.519> or<00:03:47.730> 350<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.599> these<00:03:48.720> made<00:03:49.049> do

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
was around 300 or 350 of these made do

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.039 
was around 300 or 350 of these made do
you<00:03:49.860> know<00:03:50.069> where<00:03:50.280> they're<00:03:50.459> all<00:03:50.640> at<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:51.299> think<00:03:51.959> we

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
you know where they're all at I think we

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.930 
you know where they're all at I think we
