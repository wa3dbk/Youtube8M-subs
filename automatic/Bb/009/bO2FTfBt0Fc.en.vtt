00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.590 
you just place it align those white dots
and<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:35.560> twist<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.160> back<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:37.210> that's<00:04:37.450> how

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
and just twist it back and that's how

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.590 
and just twist it back and that's how
you<00:04:37.890> attach<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.070> lens<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.460> Sony<00:04:40.210> was<00:04:40.360> kind

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
you attach the lens and Sony was kind

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.300 
you attach the lens and Sony was kind
enough<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.840> give<00:04:41.080> even<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.470> lens<00:04:41.650> hood<00:04:41.950> and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
enough to give even the lens hood and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.160 
enough to give even the lens hood and
you<00:04:42.730> can<00:04:42.880> attach<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.300> lens<00:04:43.480> hood<00:04:43.660> over<00:04:43.960> here

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
you can attach the lens hood over here

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.060 
you can attach the lens hood over here
and<00:04:44.760> let<00:04:45.760> me<00:04:45.790> show<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.330> flash<00:04:46.630> also<00:04:47.170> if

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
and let me show you the flash also if

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.650 
and let me show you the flash also if
you<00:04:48.190> notice<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.640> can<00:04:48.670> open<00:04:49.030> up<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.270> flap

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
you notice you can open up this flap

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.570 
you notice you can open up this flap
over<00:04:49.900> here<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:53.290> this<00:04:53.500> box<00:04:53.830> actually<00:04:54.160> we

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
over here and in this box actually we

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.220 
over here and in this box actually we
have<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:55.290> flash<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.740> as<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:58.960> see<00:04:59.020> this

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
have the flash and as you can see this

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.730 
have the flash and as you can see this
is<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.470> flash<00:04:59.850> you<00:05:00.850> just

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.260 

and<00:05:06.080> that<00:05:07.080> way<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:08.190> attach<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.850> flash<00:05:09.060> and

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
and that way you attach the flash and

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.380 
and that way you attach the flash and
now<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.480> screw<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.180> good

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
now you screw this in so this is a good

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.720 
now you screw this in so this is a good
idea<00:05:12.510> if<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.960> don't<00:05:13.080> need<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.440> flash<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:14.550> can

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
idea if you don't need the flash you can

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.880 
idea if you don't need the flash you can
just<00:05:14.880> move<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.480> keep<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.560> if<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:16.710> want

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
just move it and keep it but if you want

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.230 
just move it and keep it but if you want
to<00:05:16.950> attach<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.340> flash<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.730> can<00:05:17.910> do<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.120> like

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
to attach the flash you can do it like

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.830 
to attach the flash you can do it like
that<00:05:18.440> also<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:20.010> screen<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.180> it

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
that also the screen of this is a it

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.660 
that also the screen of this is a it
supports<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.560> still<00:05:22.890> t<00:05:23.040> screen<00:05:23.370> so<00:05:23.550> you<00:05:23.610> can

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
supports the still t screen so you can

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.450 
supports the still t screen so you can
tilt<00:05:24.090> it<00:05:24.270> like<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.710> doesn't<00:05:25.920> tilt<00:05:26.220> all

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
tilt it like this it doesn't tilt all

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.760 
tilt it like this it doesn't tilt all
the<00:05:26.640> way<00:05:26.790> but<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.420> little<00:05:28.110> bit<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.350> tilting<00:05:28.650> is

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
the way but a little bit of tilting is

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.070 
the way but a little bit of tilting is
supported<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.990> this<00:05:32.540> that's<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.780> for<00:05:33.930> now

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
supported like this that's it for now

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.280 
supported like this that's it for now
