00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.159

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:12.629
 in what is 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.469
 the victory 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.699
 tour 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.919
 where I was born in a tris a semblance 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.890
 of papantla in all aspects of pollution 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.279
 of services to the tourism services population 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.109
 and here we are also inside the program 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.500
 dear indie papantla which is a national program that is cute mexico and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.400
 Dear 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.470
 these are not tourism programs where we will be 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.030
 working hard 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.010
 there are not again were couple 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.680
 still spain this one said it was the parskian terek 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.120
 the filmmaker the find to the place 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.950
 salazar 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 according to a seriousness 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.400
 when developing your activity as 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
 I believe that the temporary words required 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.740
 words 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.560
 come on, a guy who 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.550
 talk without control 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.520
 that the language does not have it controlled 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.790
 I think he has conscience and I asked him to be aware 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.490
 tell the truth 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.760
 those lies 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.140
 he never tells the truth 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.200
 he stopped inventing 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.940
 how different he was 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.030
 because it seems that it is a bad thing that some politicians who want to show off 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 what they did not do 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.780
 if they have to work hours 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.550
 if they want to paint 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.340
 red are white 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.580
 its first to build them 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.900
 and after 20 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.820
 but it does not work for someone 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.770
 painting the works of the administration 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 even in Easter orlando were already elaborated by 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.660
 President 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.570
 in his management 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.260
 I am I think it is a matter of principles 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.400
 exposition 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.450
 of moral quality 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.150
 there were a few 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 tickets are for sale in japan 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.169
 Isao stopped doing it 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 shoemaker who does not need to be 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.139
 so is 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.799
 the marches of the ladies 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.199
 He made a formality to make daddy dad magical town 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.609
 the mayor like me 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.930
 we are at that moment that I started the process directly with your 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.759
 governor 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.719
 with Mr. Vicente Fox 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.469
 and with Mr. Rodolfo Elizondo 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.819
 until 2 until the trades that we throw and that he personally wore 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.339
 up to 2 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.959
 so that don Vicente Fox will help us 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.719
 and through state government the governor 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.049
 supported the proposal of papantla we achieved 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.800
 the certification of your eyes 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.709
 those dreams 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.809
 his story of martÃ­n risso 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.379
 like the same the bridge swirl 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.209
 and so also the hospital system z is building civil hospital 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.319
 although it was with fund resources and also that there is a donation certificate 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.909
 of the ground 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.019
 where our way 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.229
 of the dollar 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.459
 this field to the health sector 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.529
 to build the new civil hospital 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.659
 now that they want to want to show off what they did not do 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.659
 He said that the people are going to criticize us 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.049
 2 qualifies 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.499
 to whom so much what a politician opens 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.079
 if not your actions 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.389
 are the meats are those that are going to be rated by the population 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.579
 and the people are going to judge them 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.029
 as well as the steps of Alvarez
