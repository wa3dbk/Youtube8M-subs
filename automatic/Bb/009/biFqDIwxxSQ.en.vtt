00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.720
 good to all youtube friends 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.690
 welcome back to my channel and of 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.700
 google tall blacks 2 and action because no 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.800
 I went up to the truth a game and I already had 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.240
 really want to do it and I think 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.460
 that the oldest of you also 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.670
 and well I wanted to tell you in this video 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.440
 a couple of little things rather 3 one of 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.150
 it's about the games 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.570
 musicals if before you ask 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.580
 I'm already in it, I 'm going to try to upload it 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.650
 as quickly as possible and I think that a 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.910
 from now on they will raise the 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.800
 frequency with which I will upload those 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.540
 musical areas, I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 a little bit later let me tell you 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.510
 count now a little thing and it is that this 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.140
 this in play I have recorded with the hd 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.090
 pvr 2 gaming edition plus is not the same 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.300
 that the hd pvr 2 is a capture of the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.879
 new exactly the mls the model 1500 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.399
 ok this I guess it will not influence much 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.070
 but for you to know it is good this new 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.199
 captor have sent me the one of the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.190
 bypass and I wanted to show you the quality 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.260
 that took this example and these 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
 it's recorded directly I put it in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.180
 sony vegas and bone rendering that does not 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 touch nothing or color adjustments or anything 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.560
 bone is in the native quality that is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 1080p then I encourage you to put it and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
 that you see the quality and to see destroyed to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 see if it convinces you and I will tell you 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.149
 just a few small differences 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.909
 what is between this capturing and the 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.490
 previous the 2 and normal let's say and is that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.690
 bring optical cable, you can record the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.240
 sound in 5.1 I mean let's say the output 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.039
 of the xbox playstation3 from the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.890
 pc that you can also load tc with it 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.330
 you connect it with a 5.1 optical cable and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.399
 let's say you could record a sound in 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 stereo and in dolby sorround so 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.600
 say it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.429
 so I do not know if some of you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.899
 CÃ¡ceres a street of his friend 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.819
 extraordinary because this is yours 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.890
 capturing also a feature 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.990
 pretty good that I've seen in this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.390
 capturing and that did not have the other 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.819
 feel it is that there is almost no delay to the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 time to watch the game in the program 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.660
 capture with 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.430
 wait with the real game for 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.350
 say this for the livestream os 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.760
 could come pretty well so there's 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
 a tad late 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.470
 a tad less than a second but 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.120
 compared to others captured the truth 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 that for live streaming is the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 better obviously I recommend the hd 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.180
 pvr 1 for live streaming as it is for 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560
 me the best the truth because it does not have 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.660
 almost late but good if you want to play 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 in hdmi I think that this can be the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.710
 good option I 'm leaving aside 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.680
 you will have what you want I will leave below 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.970
 the link to guidelines valera where you can 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.460
 buy the ones captured in case 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.180
 interesting and I'm going to move on to the second 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.310
 part and that is how you know how to say 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.320
 most of you but not because I believe 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.930
 that you put us out of fear something this does 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.079
 a series of rival slender 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.540
 exactly the new game of the new 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.310
 this one that has come out and I have nothing left or 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.810
 I have a chapter left to finish 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 which by the way I'm going to upload that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.500
 chapter this afternoon is worth be in employment 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.719
 you are seeing now right after 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 eat then this glasses I'm going to 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.989
 go up a bit at night to enter 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.150
 next to him and with no atmosphere and that 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.680
 I invite you to come and see the series 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.500
 if you want before seeing the latter 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 episode since I'm not you I think 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.239
 that we get in fear for something the truth 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.469
 that does give some fright but it is not for 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.290
 so much and the truth that is a story 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:21.930
 quite entertaining and tells you the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.840
 origin of slender and how he converted and 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.090
 how that weird guy got to be 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.829
 appears in a forest is what I encourage you 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.109
 to all of you to see it like that 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.919
 have the link of the list of 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.900
 reproduction down in the box and that 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.599
 I encourage you to see it and this evening 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.099
 you will have the last episode is but not 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.200
 be that there is a secret version or 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.030
 some kind of interest and good the last 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.849
 What I wanted to say is about the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.640
 musical parodies that by the way the 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.590
 last and I have little left to get it out 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.990
 you will know that the last one was the swarm 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.940
 enemy that in March well if you want 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.520
 uploading a new one was already about to 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.920
 finish the so patience I ask you and 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.190
 because I want to upload gameplays debla 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.690
 cults more often I'll give you 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.270
 a number of reasons to feel host 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.530
 uncle, well you're right if you remember 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.630
 when I started on youtube there is a point 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.900
 which would be the modern gameplay 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.290
 warfare 3 daily diary even reaches 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.150
 times uploaded a day and at that time 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.250
 I had many ideas for 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.010
 make musical parodies and it was in that 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.310
 time in June when I take out the first 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.320
 parody that was moa's next to 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.560
 the week but a week to 7 days ag 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.900
 I would camp and the next 7 days 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.410
 the 56 days or a very short time 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.430
 that the one that plays alcohol and the truth 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.530
 is that those parties have had a success 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.490
 incredible about everything I will change that 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.960
 It has more than 2 million 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.610
 reproductions 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.800
 and that's why because as if 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.330
 so many examples a day and I played so much 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.449
 a lot of ideas happened to me then what 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.909
 What do I want to do to put on and reed 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.889
 to the call of duty to target 2 in this case 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.590
 and so I came up with a lot of ideas and 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.729
 I will be able to bring many more songs 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.069
 followed you do not really want is what 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.900
 you want and hope and that's what 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.180
 like to me from my channel what is it that 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.650
 gives a different touch to the rest and that's 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.930
 what really matters to me and is 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.759
 do something different not something repetitive 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.830
 can be these gameplays or examples 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.279
 of fear and that apart from these 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.389
 simple white 2 I will try to bring you 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.370
 the scary games that I know many of 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.139
 you also like it and that's good 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.120
 just the video and do not want me anymore 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.889
 roll up marjah that structure screen 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.330
 the black right now and what we see 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.069
 the next video you know this afternoon 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.620
 arrival slender I encourage you to spend 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:41.150
 for the series that is pretty good and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.150
 see you in another video to another
