00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.399
 the applications in life play a 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.650
 very important role in the whole world 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.509
 because I do not bother you anymore, they send you to be 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.669
 restricted to use an application 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.200
 only on a web page but also 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.000
 you can use it in any 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.250
 mobile device do not say be a 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.099
 Say cell phone is a tablet in this 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.019
 case then the playbook and also we 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.939
 allows us to expand as such the 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.679
 market are a market that is already 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.300
 Find saturated and have a market 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.130
 that gives us the opportunity to be 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.380
 competitive and have income 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 really interesting we really have 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.309
 great expectations we are waiting 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.140
 that all the people that really 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.539
 are involved in the subject of communication 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.489
 of development design that can 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.170
 participate the open doors to 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.109
 all within the expectations of the 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.309
 Blackberry challenge really is to find 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.219
 the person who can do a great 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.650
 application because sometimes people have 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.990
 ideas 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.600
 not because of fear for lack of knowledge 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.370
 does not carry out that idea and now it goes 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.950
 to have many means for people to 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.660
 can develop its applications well 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.220
 that I have the expectation that here 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.960
 in Peru they will find and go to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.400
 develop a very good application that 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.600
 you can go around the world the one 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.970
 is giving all the tools 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 necessary are you offering yourself not 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.690
 only information on the on the web in 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.190
 the site in the forum but also 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.960
 training losses you will be able to 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.610
 participate within the lack with which 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.740
 they will see inside blackberry here in 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.180
 Peru and also is offering a money 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.830
 interesting is an opportunity where you 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.560
 you can practically become a rockstar 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.080
 in mobile applications it's pretty 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.580
 simple quite simple to use it and 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.740
 they should not have as such is the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.320
 fear party for africa you're going to have the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.090
 opportunity to show that you can 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.350
 create a high level application with 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 the tools that you already know do not 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.920
 you have to learn the new technology 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.890
 you can use html5 you can use 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.970
 flash within the expectations that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.759
 we can have some applications 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.050
 any one that can really occupy 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.810
 all the characteristics that the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.659
 tablet like which is like the camera the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.909
 accelerometer geolocation 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.770
 and sensitive would like to see many things 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.810
 with games and I'm very into the subject 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.530
 of games to be able to create an application 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.440
 inside the playbook that has 3d or a 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.360
 game in 2d would be ideal and I think that 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.160
 In Peru there is a lot to promote the theme 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.750
 of games I know many communities 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.890
 very safe districts that they are going to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.530
 be totally interested in 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.810
 to participate, they make me come together 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 in teams yes you can assemble teams 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 with someone who is a designer with others 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.849
 developers can achieve a 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.849
 excellent application no issues
