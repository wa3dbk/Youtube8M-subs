think<00:01:32.280> that'll<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.579> pretty<00:01:32.759> trick<00:01:33.119> could<00:01:33.329> be

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
think that'll be pretty trick could be

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
think that'll be pretty trick could be
in<00:01:33.509> black<00:01:33.659> screen<00:01:34.049> should<00:01:34.229> look<00:01:34.290> pretty<00:01:34.439> good

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
in black screen should look pretty good

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
in black screen should look pretty good
we'll<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.000> works<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> good<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.990> in

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we'll see if that works is good and in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.399 
we'll see if that works is good and in
reality<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.310> doesn't<00:01:38.579> concept<00:01:39.320> let's<00:01:40.320> go

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
