00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.690
 food diary of me and thus already that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.910
 third and I now start at just 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.700
 Monday monday morning was with me 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 Spelled bread with legal cheese and 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 pickles and a bit 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.130
 student food nations because then I 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 but I still had so much trouble 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 My salad was actually for lunch 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260
 was also plastered smooth you see 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.019
 I have a salad here again 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.029
 glass with red cord with paprika 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 and a bit onions 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.790
 at noon there were parsnips like lotto 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.040
 the vegan before fit book by attila 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
 hildmann that tastes very good to me 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 especially the combination white wine and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.870
 Parsnips I find it very much 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.450
 succeeded and with the dried ones 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 It's really such a tomato 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.410
 Tasty experiences should be on everyone 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.870
 case 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.969
 each of you have tried in the evening 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 There was something in my house which my parents did 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 have eaten the romania when they are there 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 have lived 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.050
 which calls itself with us is the wedges 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 I think nothing more than stew 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.619
 or pot and that's such a stew 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.500
 actually made from rice tomatoes paprika 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.990
 with a little bit 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.610

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.020
 a bit parsley so yes I know 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.470

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.970

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.360

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.940

 not really to eat 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.110
