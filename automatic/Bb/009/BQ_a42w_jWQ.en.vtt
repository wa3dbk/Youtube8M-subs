against that a six pawn if rug b6 for
example<00:01:21.429> then<00:01:22.429> this<00:01:22.729> looks<00:01:23.029> like<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.270> very

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
example then this looks like a very

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.809 
example then this looks like a very
dangerous<00:01:23.810> infiltration<00:01:24.499> with<00:01:25.039> Quincy<00:01:25.549> eight

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
dangerous infiltration with Quincy eight

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:29.949 
dangerous infiltration with Quincy eight
check<00:01:27.729> it<00:01:28.729> looks<00:01:29.149> as<00:01:29.329> though<00:01:29.359> that's<00:01:29.659> going<00:01:29.899> to

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
check it looks as though that's going to

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.590 
check it looks as though that's going to
be<00:01:30.049> all<00:01:30.229> over<00:01:30.590> if<00:01:30.770> King<00:01:31.069> e7<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:32.119> know<00:01:32.209> maybe<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
be all over if King e7 you know maybe a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.899 
be all over if King e7 you know maybe a
move<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.049> Queen<00:01:33.409> g8<00:01:33.859> and<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.700> going<00:01:34.849> to

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
move like Queen g8 and that's going to

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.839 
move like Queen g8 and that's going to
be<00:01:34.999> difficult<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.389> the<00:01:35.539> fens<00:01:35.779> f7<00:01:36.499> so<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.609> porn

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
be difficult to the fens f7 so the porn

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:44.620 
be difficult to the fens f7 so the porn
had<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.179> go<00:01:40.630> okay<00:01:42.219> so<00:01:43.219> now<00:01:43.429> this<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.509> getting

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
had to go okay so now this is getting

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.589 
had to go okay so now this is getting
very<00:01:44.810> difficult<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.439> black<00:01:45.709> i<00:01:45.740> palmed<00:01:46.189> down

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
very difficult for black i palmed down

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.239 
very difficult for black i palmed down
technically<00:01:47.599> still<00:01:48.289> a<00:01:48.560> very<00:01:48.799> uncomfortable

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
technically still a very uncomfortable

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.359 
technically still a very uncomfortable
position<00:01:50.349> but<00:01:51.349> maybe<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.859> know<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.130> team

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
position but maybe you know the team

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.940 
position but maybe you know the team
felt<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.909> opposite<00:01:53.299> color<00:01:53.479> bishops<00:01:53.950> would

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
felt that opposite color bishops would

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.870 
felt that opposite color bishops would
be<00:01:55.099> some<00:01:55.369> sort<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.609> saving<00:01:57.490> resource<00:01:58.490> at<00:01:58.700> some

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
be some sort of saving resource at some

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.969 
be some sort of saving resource at some
point<00:01:59.149> but<00:01:59.389> in<00:01:59.630> this<00:01:59.779> particular<00:01:59.959> position<00:02:00.770> it

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
point but in this particular position it

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.870 
point but in this particular position it
just<00:02:01.549> seems<00:02:01.819> incredibly<00:02:02.419> difficult<00:02:03.880> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
just seems incredibly difficult so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.850 
just seems incredibly difficult so
Bishop<00:02:05.119> g5<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:07.270> now<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.420> move<00:02:08.690> Bishop<00:02:08.929> b5<00:02:09.619> so

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
gaining a tempo for a rear ooting

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.840 
gaining a tempo for a rear ooting
maneuver<00:02:12.740> actually<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.160> bishop<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.520> coming
