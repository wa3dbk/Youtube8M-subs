00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 The glasses are just the big hype 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 at the beginning of next year, finally the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.160
 Optimus hits the market coming sony 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.050
 will even know this year 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.480
 These will be like the gaming world 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 but maybe it will revolutionize it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 There are more uses my 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 name is ben and that's what's going on 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 shops whole 20 years was so far at the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.400
 virtual reality glasses technology 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.529
 rumgebastelt 2012 there was one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 milestone the cinemas ran on 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 kickstarter presented and within 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 In the shortest time , thousands declared themselves 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 kickstarter user ready money for a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 not even exist via glasses 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.030
 output 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.500
 it does not take long until the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
 work something like everyday life with us 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.780
 the company oculus rift delivers in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 spring 2013 the first copies 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.399
 Developer out for the consumer 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
 At the beginning of 2016, models will be launched on the market 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 but come off the gaming world 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.980
 there are other interesting ones 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 make things with the virtual world of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.270
 the worst of journalism for example 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 is called the type of journalism in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.519
 which one can immerse better because the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.939
 contributions made especially for diablo 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.920
 become 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.049
 but what is so extraordinary about it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.460
 through the more realistic sense impression 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.010
 should the experiences you make 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 much more intense are the remains 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.920
 in the truest sense of the word, much longer 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.450
 in the back head 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.640
 we can be much better able to do so 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.009
 empathize with other people if we have one 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.990
 experience similar situation as well 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.610
 We are very much influenced by visual impressions 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.380
 virtual reality could be concrete 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.210
 convey what it looks like in one 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 crisis area actually looks like it feels 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.020
 getting on in a bombed city too 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.270
 standing or on a refugee boat 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 with such impressions it is then too 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.030
 possible more understanding for people in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.710
 not to have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 if someone is about refugees 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.450
 he or she is least likely to complain 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
 fall ever in an approximate way 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 it has been a similar situation 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.689
 even possible for a long time 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.909
 to put themselves in a robot 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.920
 because you get so attracted to a murder 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.869
 at the markings are the walls 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.909
 captured her probably know that from 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.369
 movie with the lord of the rings or planet of 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.259
 Monkeys have done that to figures on 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.680
 computer to give human movements 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.720
 be in this case 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 also the movement recorded and on 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.100
 a robotic transfer of the then 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.530
 also just reacted with help of 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 Glasses are then seen as seen 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.190
 in the head of the machine 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470
 So you can use the robot with the body 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.110
 control and at the same time see what 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.880
 happened and the robot can thanks to the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.770
 Internets are everywhere in the world 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.050
 in this example is the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.850
 user in a real environment can do it 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.709
 but also virtual worlds on the computer 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.260
 to be created in which one is free 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.940
 can move in real filmed 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.560
 of course that is in the scenarios 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.390
 movement restricted k 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 you can only go where the camera 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.989
 also filmed the virtual worlds 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 you can see that it is not real 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.980
 But the sensory impressions are already 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.540
 enormously maybe someone has already 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.850
 from you tried one via twitter 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.920
 then you know how awesome that already be 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.959
 can always be improved 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.880
 technology and graphics though these 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.459
 impressions become more and more powerful on the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.440
 usc school of cinematic arts becomes that 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.330
 with the virtual world already some 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.100
 time spent around budding 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.020
 Journalists, for example, put pressure on 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.790
 to mediate syria on a rather 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.070
 playful way it is so possible 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.209
 to gain experience and this 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.730
 Experiences remain through the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.739
 ego perspective hanging much stronger than 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.959
 you would get a report with photos 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.760
 read through or watch a doku it 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.170
 the only question is if it is too much 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.850
 even experiences in the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.250
 if you can already give a report 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.690
 a virtual trip to be very emotional 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.580
 if you can then for example 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.239
 every day different scenarios 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.190
 expose 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.750
 probably not more of it 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.000
 rather, this virtual report 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.830
 a supplement to the previous media 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.420
 are also is not any so 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.610
 have a glasses at home meanwhile 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.980
 There are already impressive things 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.350
 to see we sender arte was now for 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.690
 a 360 degree doku with the grimme online 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.670
 award is there you can 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.780
 while the movie is running all over 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.820
 look around 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.260
 in the usa should be a leisure park 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.880
 in which the visitors are opened 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.760
 walk through rooms with glasses 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.470
 so can a kind of holodeck on the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.810
 Real walls can be all kinds 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.390
 things project from the scifi shooter to 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.510
 but also here are the fantasy epic 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.519
 realistic worlds conceivable 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.470
 so in the middle in a perception 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.420
 revolution no matter if games or 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.040
 Reporting the experiences the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.720
 We can do it all 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.880
 great opportunity understanding for others 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.040
 to build people and other circumstances 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.070
 Here we have the cheap version 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.870
 One year tried google carport 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.000
 and here's our online 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.949
 Playlist you would be virtual in one 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.990
 Crisis area traveling or on one 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.760
 want to take refugee boat with you 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.320
 Opinion in the comments to 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.320
 next time i am the band
