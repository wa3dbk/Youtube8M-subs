light bulb every wants a wire like you
can<00:00:18.890> get<00:00:19.070> lucky<00:00:19.250> if<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.150> filaments<00:00:20.750> intact

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
can get lucky if the filaments intact

tap it sometimes you see the little

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.980 
tap it sometimes you see the little
spark<00:00:27.170> there<00:00:28.390> sometimes<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:29.480> can<00:00:29.630> get<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:29.900> to

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
spark there sometimes you can get it to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.810 
spark there sometimes you can get it to
light<00:00:30.140> up<00:00:30.170> at<00:00:30.859> this<00:00:31.010> point<00:00:31.279> what<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:31.580> want<00:00:31.760> to

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
light up at this point what you want to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.180 
light up at this point what you want to
do<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.150> go<00:00:32.330> ahead<00:00:32.449> and<00:00:32.750> leave<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:32.960> on<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.980> let

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
do is go ahead and leave it on and let

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.420 
do is go ahead and leave it on and let
it<00:00:34.340> read<00:00:34.610> well<00:00:34.879> back<00:00:35.239> together<00:00:35.769> take<00:00:36.769> 10<00:00:37.010> 15

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
it read well back together take 10 15

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.850 
it read well back together take 10 15
minutes<00:00:37.790> or<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:38.420> then<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.140> can<00:00:39.170> reset<00:00:39.830> the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
minutes or so and then you can reset the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.820 
minutes or so and then you can reset the
light<00:00:40.160> turn<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:40.970> back<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.440> turn<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.530> back<00:00:42.650> off

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
light turn it back on turn it back off

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.549 
light turn it back on turn it back off
turn<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:43.220> back<00:00:43.400> on<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:43.940> see<00:00:44.000> if<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:45.110> find<00:00:45.350> its

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
turn it back on and see if it find its

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.130 
turn it back on and see if it find its
connection<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:46.549> has<00:00:47.089> welded<00:00:47.540> itself<00:00:47.900> back

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
connection and has welded itself back

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.079 
connection and has welded itself back
together<00:00:48.350> if<00:00:48.799> not<00:00:48.830> you<00:00:49.250> need<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.519> replace<00:00:49.729> it

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
together if not you need to replace it

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:58.950 
together if not you need to replace it
but<00:00:50.379> if<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:51.620> resets<00:00:52.519> we're<00:00:53.269> going<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.780> try<00:00:54.019> it

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.240 

like<00:00:59.590> ethics<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.560> kind<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.860> only<00:01:03.040> works

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
like ethics so this kind of only works

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.090 
like ethics so this kind of only works
about<00:01:03.610> maybe<00:01:03.850> one<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:04.269> eight<00:01:04.390> pumps<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
about maybe one in eight pumps to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.570 
about maybe one in eight pumps to
actually<00:01:06.490> fix<00:01:06.760> it<00:01:07.000> okay<00:01:07.630> but<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.260> does<00:01:08.710> work<00:01:09.520> so

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
actually fix it okay but it does work so

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.690 
actually fix it okay but it does work so
often<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.750> happened<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.350> often<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:12.550> was

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
often and it happened so often it was

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.580 
often and it happened so often it was
kind<00:01:12.910> of<00:01:13.000> one<00:01:13.150> of<00:01:13.180> those<00:01:13.330> things<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.780> me<00:01:14.410> it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
kind of one of those things that me it's

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.400 
kind of one of those things that me it's
always<00:01:14.950> worth<00:01:15.100> worth<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.000> shot<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:17.110> want

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
always worth worth a shot you just want

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.050 
always worth worth a shot you just want
to<00:01:17.440> avoid<00:01:17.590> shaking<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.340> other<00:01:18.460> light<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:18.910> you

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
to avoid shaking the other light so you

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940 
to avoid shaking the other light so you
don't<00:01:19.240> break<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.840> different<00:01:20.229> light<00:01:20.380> anyway

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
don't break in a different light anyway

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.110 
don't break in a different light anyway
this<00:01:21.610> one's<00:01:21.880> all<00:01:22.090> set<00:01:23.550> yeah<00:01:25.110> yep
