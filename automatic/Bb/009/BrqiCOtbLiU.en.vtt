taking away episode 1 from the folder

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.630 
taking away episode 1 from the folder
because<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.680> not<00:03:04.830> needed<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:05.310> it's

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
because it's not needed because it's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.759

there<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.120> that's<00:03:06.750> how<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.050> will<00:03:07.230> repeat<00:03:07.590> this

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
there and that's how it will repeat this

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.910
