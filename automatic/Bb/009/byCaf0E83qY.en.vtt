00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
tool for making the job of getting the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.959 
tool for making the job of getting the
nut<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.050> which<00:00:10.320> holds<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.920> counter<00:00:11.400> sprocket

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
nut up which holds the counter sprocket

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.990 
nut up which holds the counter sprocket
and<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:13.049> really<00:00:13.380> simplify<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.040> job<00:00:14.340> there's

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and to really simplify that job there's

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
and to really simplify that job there's
a<00:00:15.089> lot<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> different<00:00:15.660> ways<00:00:15.780> people<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:16.320> used

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
a lot of different ways people have used

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.910 
a lot of different ways people have used
over<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> years<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.480> wedges<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.560> here

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
over the years that it wedges in here

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.210 
over the years that it wedges in here
though<00:00:20.630> they'll<00:00:21.630> leave<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> chain<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.470> tranqs

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
though they'll leave the chain on tranqs

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250 
though they'll leave the chain on tranqs
the<00:00:23.460> step<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> break<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.630> try<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> hold

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the step on the break to try and hold

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.490 
the step on the break to try and hold
the<00:00:25.439> chain<00:00:25.710> from<00:00:26.010> turning<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.500> sometimes

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the chain from turning and sometimes

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.349 
the chain from turning and sometimes
people<00:00:28.710> even<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.429> impact<00:00:29.789> gun<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> get

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
people even use an impact gun to get

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.740 
people even use an impact gun to get
that<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.750> while<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.070> ways<00:00:32.460> work<00:00:33.420> for

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
that up while all these ways work for

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.330 
that up while all these ways work for
people<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.350> people<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:34.950> had<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> do

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
people because people have had to do

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.209 
people because people have had to do
this<00:00:35.489> over<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> years<00:00:36.410> they're<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.559> they<00:00:38.100> all

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this over the years they're all they all

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.670

have their setbacks an impact gun you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.220 
have their setbacks an impact gun you
can<00:00:40.860> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> potential<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.450> damaging<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
can there's a potential for damaging the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
can there's a potential for damaging the
gears<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> transmission<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> other

gears and the transmission and the other

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.060 
gears and the transmission and the other
way<00:00:45.960> sometimes<00:00:46.440> they're<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> getting<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
way sometimes they're just getting it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
way sometimes they're just getting it
difficult<00:00:47.460> sometimes<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.570> bit

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
difficult sometimes you get a little bit

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
difficult sometimes you get a little bit
of<00:00:48.780> corrosion<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.710> from<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> wash

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
of corrosion in here from when you wash

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.939 
of corrosion in here from when you wash
your<00:00:51.059> bike<00:00:51.239> after<00:00:51.480> riding<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.559> comes<00:00:52.739> time

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
your bike after riding and it comes time

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.590 
your bike after riding and it comes time
to<00:00:53.010> take<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.489> nut<00:00:53.699> off<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.120> wants

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to take that nut off and it just wants

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.569 
to take that nut off and it just wants
to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.110> difficult<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to be a little difficult so what we have

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
to be a little difficult so what we have
here<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.940> we've<00:00:57.149> developed<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.840> tool

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
here is we've developed this little tool

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.610 
here is we've developed this little tool
this<00:00:58.829> particular<00:00:59.460> tool<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.090> dedicated<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.440> the

13 to Kanter sprocket little marking

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
13 to Kanter sprocket little marking
here<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> tool<00:01:05.610> tells<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.360> what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
here on the tool tells you for what

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.109 
here on the tool tells you for what
sprocket<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.170> for<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.220> make<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> 14

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
sprocket it's for we also make the 14

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.550 
sprocket it's for we also make the 14
and<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> 15<00:01:09.780> tooth<00:01:10.080> too<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.880> tool<00:01:12.560> would

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and a 15 tooth too and this tool would

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.429 
and a 15 tooth too and this tool would
go<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.869> just<00:01:15.869> goes<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.409> over

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
go on right here just goes right over

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
go on right here just goes right over
the<00:01:16.740> sprocket<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.090> locks

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the sprocket just like that and locks

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.429 
the sprocket just like that and locks
into<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> swingarm<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.520> here

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
into the swingarm as you can see here

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.999 
into the swingarm as you can see here
alright<00:01:23.900> just<00:01:24.900> goes<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.530> there<00:01:25.799> like

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
alright just goes right on there like

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.050 
alright just goes right on there like
that<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:28.100> we've<00:01:29.100> already<00:01:29.310> we've

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that and then we've already we've

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.230 
that and then we've already we've
already<00:01:30.210> bent<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> tabs<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.470> show<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
already bent the tabs out to show you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
already bent the tabs out to show you
what<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.420> doing<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.619> would

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
what we're doing here and then you would

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.260 
what we're doing here and then you would
just<00:01:34.920> put<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.280> wrench<00:01:35.460> over<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:38.270> off

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
just put your wrench over there and off

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.370 
just put your wrench over there and off
it<00:01:39.509> comes<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:42.049> this<00:01:43.049> tool<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it comes just like that so this tool is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.399 
it comes just like that so this tool is
patent-pending<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:46.170> really

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
patent-pending and this really

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.730 
patent-pending and this really
simplifies<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.220> job<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.560> take<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
simplifies this job a lot so take that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
simplifies this job a lot so take that
off<00:01:50.600> put<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> new<00:01:51.780> sprocket<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.970> make<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.119> we

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
off put the new sprocket on make sure we

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.389 
off put the new sprocket on make sure we
have<00:01:54.509> our<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.990> locking<00:01:55.619> washer<00:01:55.860> there

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
have our little locking washer there

to get the teeth lined up

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.550 
to get the teeth lined up
then<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:07.119> put<00:02:07.299> on<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> torque<00:02:07.810> adapter<00:02:08.380> here

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
then just put on a torque adapter here

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.280 
then just put on a torque adapter here
another<00:02:09.130> beauty<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:10.270> tool<00:02:10.599> is<00:02:10.899> that

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
another beauty of this tool is that

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.699 
another beauty of this tool is that
because<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:13.030> way<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.420> holds<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.140> sprocket

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
because the way it holds the sprocket

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.339 
because the way it holds the sprocket
it's<00:02:14.920> real<00:02:15.220> easy<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.300> exact<00:02:16.810> torque

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
it's real easy to get the exact torque

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.650 
it's real easy to get the exact torque
the<00:02:18.310> manufacturer<00:02:19.030> spec<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:22.239> now<00:02:22.450> we'll<00:02:22.630> just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the manufacturer spec so now we'll just

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.630 
the manufacturer spec so now we'll just
turn<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.319> it's<00:02:23.530> holding<00:02:23.739> itself<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.370> place

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
turn that it's holding itself in place

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.750 
turn that it's holding itself in place
and<00:02:25.350> you'll<00:02:26.350> hear<00:02:26.560> an<00:02:26.709> audible<00:02:26.950> beep<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.730> that

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
and you'll hear an audible beep and that

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.729 
and you'll hear an audible beep and that
tells<00:02:28.300> us<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.600> start<00:02:28.810> watching<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.350> get<00:02:29.530> right

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
tells us to start watching we get right

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.890 
tells us to start watching we get right
up<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.950> 54<00:02:30.670> foot-pounds<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.420> torque

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
up to 54 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.710 
up to 54 foot-pounds of torque
perfect<00:02:32.860> torque<00:02:33.269> exactly<00:02:34.269> what<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> book

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
perfect torque exactly what the book

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.280 
perfect torque exactly what the book
says

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
says
