00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
of wire that where the tooth aren't

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.210 
of wire that where the tooth aren't
bracketed<00:01:07.530> are<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.790> there<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:10.220> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
bracketed are there in there and that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.249 
bracketed are there in there and that
the<00:01:11.369> springs<00:01:11.850> created<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> extra<00:01:13.500> room<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
the springs created with extra room and

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.359 
the springs created with extra room and
all<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.590> did<00:01:16.799> interproximal

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
all they also did interproximal

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
all they also did interproximal
reduction<00:01:18.180> which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.780> shave<00:01:19.049> down

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
reduction which is where they shave down

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
reduction which is where they shave down
the<00:01:19.500> gaps<00:01:19.680> between<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.100> teeth<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
nail file kind of thing to create even

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.789 
nail file kind of thing to create even
more<00:01:23.820> space<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.500> power

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
more space and then they put power

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
more space and then they put power
chains<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.640> teeth<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.270> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
chains on my back teeth which are like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
chains on my back teeth which are like
the<00:01:27.780> colored<00:01:28.259> elastics<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> all

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the colored elastics you get that all

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
the colored elastics you get that all
joined<00:01:29.520> together<00:01:29.780> sew<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> elastic<00:01:31.049> set<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
joined together sew the elastic set the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
joined together sew the elastic set the
power<00:01:32.310> chains<00:01:32.640> pulled<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.270> tooth

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
power chains pulled on my tooth

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.140 
power chains pulled on my tooth
backwards<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> springs<00:01:35.520> creative

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
backwards and then the springs creative

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
backwards and then the springs creative
space<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> result<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
space like that so the result is that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.840 
space like that so the result is that
five<00:01:39.509> weeks<00:01:39.720> later<00:01:39.930> I've<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:41.490> dramatic

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
five weeks later I've got to dramatic

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.090 
five weeks later I've got to dramatic
gasp<00:01:42.799> there<00:01:44.180> in<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.530> company<00:01:46.530> signal<00:01:46.950> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
gasp there in the company signal here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.410 
gasp there in the company signal here
it's<00:01:47.759> created<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> nice<00:01:48.299> load<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> space<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's created a nice load of space and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.370 
it's created a nice load of space and
unfortunately<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.600> quite<00:01:51.840> enough<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.259> get

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
unfortunately not quite enough to get

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
unfortunately not quite enough to get
the<00:01:52.530> last<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.159> teeth<00:01:53.340> bracketed<00:01:53.850> today<00:01:54.060> which

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the last two teeth bracketed today which

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170 
the last two teeth bracketed today which
I'm<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.570> disappointed<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:56.180> hey-ho

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and but yeah so that's the state of play

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.929 
and but yeah so that's the state of play
now<00:02:01.770> I've<00:02:02.009> gotta<00:02:02.250> wait<00:02:02.399> another<00:02:02.670> four<00:02:02.880> weeks

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
now I've gotta wait another four weeks

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.100 
now I've gotta wait another four weeks
and<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.530> they<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:05.070> create<00:02:05.340> enough<00:02:05.640> space

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and see if they can create enough space

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.830 
and see if they can create enough space
to<00:02:07.950> bracket<00:02:08.280> those<00:02:08.430> last<00:02:08.670> two<00:02:08.880> teeth<00:02:09.180> I'm

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to bracket those last two teeth I'm

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
to bracket those last two teeth I'm
really<00:02:10.140> hoping<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.830> because<00:02:11.640> I'm<00:02:11.730> really

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
really hoping they do because I'm really

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.510 
really hoping they do because I'm really
hoping<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.420> my<00:02:12.540> surgery<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.050> year<00:02:13.520> which

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
hoping I have my surgery this year which

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520 
hoping I have my surgery this year which
would<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.910> about<00:02:15.000> six<00:02:15.450> months<00:02:15.630> ahead<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.380> what

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
would be about six months ahead of what

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.530 
would be about six months ahead of what
a<00:02:16.680> state<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.730> everything's<00:02:18.060> moved<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
a state but everything's moved so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.740 
a state but everything's moved so
quickly<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:20.340> at<00:02:20.520> first<00:02:20.730> you're<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.420> aware

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
quickly I think at first you're so aware

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.600 
quickly I think at first you're so aware
of<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> weeks<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.890> week<00:02:23.160> seemed<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.520> go

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
of the weeks and the week seemed to go

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.050 
of the weeks and the week seemed to go
really<00:02:23.820> win<00:02:24.090> slowly<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.780> i<00:02:24.810> am<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.230> twink

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
really win slowly and here i am a twink

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.620 
really win slowly and here i am a twink
2323<00:02:27.060> today<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.790> weeks<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.330> flying

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
2323 today and the weeks are just flying

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.100 
2323 today and the weeks are just flying
by<00:02:30.860> absolutely<00:02:31.860> flying<00:02:32.070> by<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.780> i'll<00:02:33.780> try<00:02:33.990> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
by absolutely flying by so i'll try and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.320 
by absolutely flying by so i'll try and
do<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> place<00:02:34.470> i<00:02:34.500> put<00:02:34.740> my<00:02:34.890> teeth<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.490> i<00:02:35.970> don't

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
do a place i put my teeth but i don't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.490 
do a place i put my teeth but i don't
think

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.650 

I<00:02:43.560> also<00:02:44.370> think<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.090> some<00:02:45.270> profile

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
I also think I want to do some profile

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000 
I also think I want to do some profile
shots<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.260> haven't<00:02:46.410> any<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.680> those<00:02:46.770> yet

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
shots because I haven't any of those yet

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.780 
shots because I haven't any of those yet
so<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.330> see<00:02:48.590> my<00:02:49.590> face<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.070> bit<00:02:50.130> off<00:02:50.550> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
so you can see my face is a bit off to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.880 
so you can see my face is a bit off to
one<00:02:50.910> side<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.960> that<00:02:52.080> side<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:52.710> on

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
one side to that side it's that's on

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.720 
one side to that side it's that's on
that<00:02:53.610> side<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.860> I've<00:02:55.860> got<00:02:56.040> cross<00:02:56.280> bite<00:02:56.490> on

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
that side and I've got cross bite on

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:07.050 
that side and I've got cross bite on
that<00:02:57.140> side<00:03:01.070> profile<00:03:04.280> that's<00:03:05.280> my<00:03:05.430> new<00:03:05.580> son

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
that side profile that's my new son

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.240 
that side profile that's my new son
don't<00:03:07.690> fight

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.600 

so<00:03:12.850> there<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.200> that's<00:03:14.200> very<00:03:14.530> r<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:14.980> so

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
so there you go that's very r up to so

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.860 
so there you go that's very r up to so
hopefully<00:03:15.820> in<00:03:16.090> four<00:03:16.360> weeks<00:03:16.480> time<00:03:16.600> they'll

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
hopefully in four weeks time they'll

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.210 
hopefully in four weeks time they'll
break<00:03:17.020> at<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.170> last<00:03:17.380> two<00:03:17.530> teeth<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.100> they

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
break at the last two teeth and if they

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.950 
break at the last two teeth and if they
move<00:03:18.370> anything<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.090> quick<00:03:19.270> use<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
move anything like as quick use the the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.740 
move anything like as quick use the the
top<00:03:20.200> teeth<00:03:20.410> did<00:03:20.650> I'm<00:03:21.160> really<00:03:21.880> hoping<00:03:22.330> that<00:03:22.390> by

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
top teeth did I'm really hoping that by

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.230 
top teeth did I'm really hoping that by
the<00:03:22.810> end<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.140> summer<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.740> have<00:03:24.550> straight

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
the end of the summer I have straight

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.280 
the end of the summer I have straight
teeth<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.810> i'll<00:03:26.050> be<00:03:26.350> ready<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.830> my<00:03:26.950> surgery
