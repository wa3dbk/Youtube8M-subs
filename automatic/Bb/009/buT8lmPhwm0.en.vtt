00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
have I'm not sure how well this picks up

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.300 
have I'm not sure how well this picks up
on<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.650> I'm<00:01:12.650> not<00:01:12.829> sure<00:01:12.950> about<00:01:13.040> these

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
on the I'm not sure about these

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.550 
on the I'm not sure about these
recordings<00:01:13.820> pick<00:01:13.970> up<00:01:14.119> with<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.390> camera<00:01:14.869> but<00:01:15.530> I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
recordings pick up with a camera but I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.330 
recordings pick up with a camera but I
have<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:16.390> decibel<00:01:17.390> reader<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.740> I'll<00:01:19.159> say

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
have this decibel reader and I'll say

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
have this decibel reader and I'll say
how<00:01:19.490> about<00:01:19.579> these<00:01:19.880> guess

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.800 

all<00:01:24.460> right<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:24.820> this<00:01:24.970> should<00:01:25.240> be<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.480> pretty

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
all right so this should be a pretty

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.220 
all right so this should be a pretty
good<00:01:25.930> test<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.440> it<00:01:30.510> so<00:01:31.510> I'll<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.870> start<00:01:32.110> off

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
good test of it so I'll just start off

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:43.830 
good test of it so I'll just start off
with<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.620> compact<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:43.150> for<00:01:43.330> reference<00:01:43.420> I'll

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
with the compact just for reference I'll

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.890 
with the compact just for reference I'll
put<00:01:44.140> these<00:01:44.700> headphones<00:01:45.700> here<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.480> get<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.660> sense

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
put these headphones here to get a sense

00:01:46.900 --> 00:02:01.770 
put these headphones here to get a sense
of<00:01:47.110> where<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:47.860> phone<00:01:48.160> is<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.300> looks<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.630> me

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
of where the phone is so it looks to me

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.110 
of where the phone is so it looks to me
like<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.110> hider<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.590> about<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:06.100> about<00:02:06.130> 72<00:02:06.910> I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
like the hider is about it's about 72 I

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.240 
like the hider is about it's about 72 I
was<00:02:07.960> talking<00:02:08.380> there<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.649> let<00:02:08.770> me<00:02:08.860> just<00:02:08.980> try<00:02:09.130> it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
was talking there so let me just try it

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
was talking there so let me just try it
one<00:02:09.429> more<00:02:09.490> time<00:02:14.190> yeah<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.340> looking<00:02:15.520> about<00:02:16.360> 72

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
one more time yeah it's looking about 72

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.730 
one more time yeah it's looking about 72
as<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:18.130> proceed<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.940> compact<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
as I proceed to be compact now for the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:48.210 
as I proceed to be compact now for the
z3<00:02:24.640> plus<00:02:41.670> looked<00:02:42.670> about<00:02:42.930> 73<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.050> me<00:02:47.220> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
z3 plus looked about 73 to me and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:57.510 
z3 plus looked about 73 to me and
finally<00:02:48.850> for<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.440> c5<00:02:50.440> ultra<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.340> looked

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
finally for the c5 ultra so that looked

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.060 
finally for the c5 ultra so that looked
about<00:02:57.700> 84<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.780> yes<00:02:59.050> it's<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.380> big<00:02:59.530> difference<00:02:59.950> in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
about 84 so yes it's a big difference in

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.020 
about 84 so yes it's a big difference in
terms<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.610> how<00:03:01.320> loud<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.500> gets<00:03:02.670> now<00:03:03.670> someone

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
terms of how loud it gets now someone

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.460 
terms of how loud it gets now someone
who<00:03:04.090> spent<00:03:04.300> some<00:03:04.450> time<00:03:04.660> with<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.959> to

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
who spent some time with this to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.830 
who spent some time with this to
determine<00:03:06.010> overall<00:03:06.340> clarity<00:03:06.840> it's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
determine overall clarity it's

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.630 
determine overall clarity it's
unfortunate<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:08.680> not<00:03:08.830> dual<00:03:09.100> speakers

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
unfortunate that it's not dual speakers

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.780 
unfortunate that it's not dual speakers
but<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.959> very<00:03:11.350> loud<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.070> from<00:03:12.519> what<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> can

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
but it is very loud and from what I can

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.670 
but it is very loud and from what I can
tell<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.120> think<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.570> it's<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.870> pretty<00:03:14.140> quality

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
tell I think that it's a pretty quality

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:39.949 
tell I think that it's a pretty quality
