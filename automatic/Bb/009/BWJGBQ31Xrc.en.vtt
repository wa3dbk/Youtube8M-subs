what<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> recommend<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.199> beginners<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.789> for

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
what I recommend it for beginners is for

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
what I recommend it for beginners is for
several<00:01:04.140> reasons<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> plastic<00:01:05.549> comb

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
several reasons one of the plastic comb

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
several reasons one of the plastic comb
is<00:01:06.299> easy<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.740> clean<00:01:07.950> -<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.060> has<00:01:09.689> literal<00:01:10.380> nuts

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
is easy to clean - it has literal nuts

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.399 
is easy to clean - it has literal nuts
and<00:01:11.070> screws<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.360> side<00:01:12.630> those<00:01:12.960> nuts<00:01:13.229> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and screws on the side those nuts and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.039 
and screws on the side those nuts and
screws<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.100> removed<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:15.150> easily<00:01:15.509> open<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
screws can be removed to easily open the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
screws can be removed to easily open the
cover<00:01:16.259> plates<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> clean

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
cover plates so if you do need to clean

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
cover plates so if you do need to clean
the<00:01:17.790> insides<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.990> need<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.680> some

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the insides or you need to do some

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.590 
the insides or you need to do some
additional<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.509> apart

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.320 
when you blow through it you're not
going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> leak<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.770> here

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
going to leak out in here

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.770 
going to leak out in here
means<00:02:08.630> you've<00:02:08.810> got<00:02:08.990> more<00:02:09.020> air<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:10.640> play<00:02:11.360> longer

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
means you've got more air to play longer

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.520 
means you've got more air to play longer
and<00:02:12.170> you're<00:02:13.040> not<00:02:13.190> going<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.630> expend

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and you're not going to have to expend

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.020 
and you're not going to have to expend
all<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.220> air<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.520> make<00:02:16.670> sure<00:02:16.850> you've<00:02:17.000> got

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
all that air to make sure you've got

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
all that air to make sure you've got
enough<00:02:17.180> volume<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:18.680> when<00:02:18.890> you're

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
enough volume because when you're

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.760 
enough volume because when you're
leaking<00:02:19.550> air<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.120> means<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.290> force

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
leaking air that means the the force

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.110 
leaking air that means the the force
that<00:02:22.010> you're<00:02:22.070> putting<00:02:22.310> through<00:02:22.610> has<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.000> be

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
that you're putting through has to be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.180 
that you're putting through has to be
greater<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.570> get<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.080> same<00:02:24.320> amount<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.710> volume

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
greater to get the same amount of volume

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.330 
greater to get the same amount of volume
so<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:26.300> special<00:02:27.020> twenty<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.500> airtight

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
so the special twenty is airtight

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280 
so the special twenty is airtight
those<00:02:28.880> are<00:02:29.030> just<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.240> several<00:02:29.600> reasons<00:02:30.050> why<00:02:30.260> I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
those are just the several reasons why I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.230 
those are just the several reasons why I
think<00:02:30.440> beginners<00:02:31.280> should<00:02:31.610> start<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.210> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
think beginners should start with a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.480 
think beginners should start with a
harmonica<00:02:33.080> like<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.530> special<00:02:33.950> 20<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.400> if

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
harmonica like the special 20 and if

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.890 
harmonica like the special 20 and if
you've<00:02:34.640> had<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> cheaper<00:02:35.360> harp<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
you've had a cheaper harp in the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.990 
you've had a cheaper harp in the
beginning<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.490> what<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:37.790> want<00:02:37.910> to

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
