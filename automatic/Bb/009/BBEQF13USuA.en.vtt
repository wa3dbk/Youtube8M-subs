00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.090
 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) Everybody a seat. Well, today and I are honored 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 to welcome an up-and-coming basketball team - (laughs) - to the White House 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.180
 the world champion Miami Heat. (Applause.) 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 Now, for many of the teams coming here, this is a lot of cameras in one place. This is a 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.509
 a little overwhelming. (Laughter.) But for the Heat, that's what the practice looks like. (Laughter.) 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.509
 This is normal. I know this is the first trip for some of these players, but some of them 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.030
 here was a bakkie game a few years ago on my birthday. 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.030
 Now, I'm not trying to take all the credit, Coach, but I think it's clear 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.469
 Will be willing to take Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook against me. (Laughter.) 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.469
 It enhances their skills. This gives them the competitive advantage they need. And I think 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.970
 part of why they came back today they want another shot at the old man. (Laughter.) 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.970
 But first, I congratulate the heat on their well-deserved title. This team traveled 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.730
 a long way to get where they are. In 2011, the heat just went all the way to the finals 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 came short. But when you fall, the real test is whether you can ignore the naysayers, 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 choose yourself and come back stronger. And that's true in basketball, but it is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.680
 true in life. This is exactly what these guys have. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 Instead of getting down, they got better. Dwayne Wade worked at his core. LeBron learned 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 some post move from Hakeem. Shane Battier boarded. They have a more complete 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 team. They got to know each other better and trust each other more. And they have more 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 fun to watch. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.460
 In Game celebrating the Thunder last year, we saw LeBron off the floor with cramps, 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.610
 just to come back a few minutes later and hit a three-pointer dagger 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.560
 Heat ahead. During Game Six, we saw him pull off one of the greatest achievements in basketball 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.450
 playoff history, falling 45 points - and he has a scary look in his eye. (Laughter.) 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.610
 We see Dwayne Wade, the heart and soul of this team, continue to do what it takes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.850
 to win, including team guidance in blocks. And at the post-game press conferences, he did 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.330
 dressed well enough to make the country in GQ magazine. (Laughter.) Show them your kick 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.750
 Here, Dwayne. (Laughter.) If any of you can pull it off - (laugh) - other than 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.750
 Dwayne Wade, let me know. We see Chris madness gets injured, but gets healthy right at the 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.140
 perfect time and do outstanding work throughout the rest of the play offs. 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.810
 And it wasn't just the Big Three. Mike Miller could barely walk. Mike, you look better now. 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.810
 (Laughter.) You broke last year - (Laughter) - but still hit Seven three-pointers 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.160
 in the final game. I don't know how he did it because he couldn't walk. He looks like 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.100
 an old man. Mario Chalmers deserves a nickname from Dwayne Wade that I am not 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.140
 allowed to repeat. (Laughter.) But he has a big job. 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.140
 Shane Battier, as always, played impeccable defense, hit big tries. Juwan Howard - "Grandpa" 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 - The first member of the Fab Five to win a ring. And Coach constantly 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.360
 show and these guys kept motivated the whole way. 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.319
 So team mentality - with everyone doing their part is what ultimately the heat 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.530
 over the top. And this is especially impressive when you think about everything they have 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.150
 has been going over the last few years. This team inspired a lot of the passions on both 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.830
 sides. And I'm just talking about their dance moves. (Laughter.) We see that video, 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.930
 LeBron. (Laughter.) 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.420
 But even if I'm a little disappointed that the Bulls didn't, I would 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.940
 Congratulations to you for a well-deserved championship. LeBron said, "It's about 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.940
 damn time. "And I want to thank them for taking the time to spend with this afternoon 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.720
 wounded soldiers at Walter Reed, because you guys are heroes, but they are heroes 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.960
 for all of us. 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.600
 And just let me say one last thing about these guys, and I have it when we come 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.600
 . There is a lot of focus on what is happening at court, but what is also important 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.590
 is what happens from the court. And I don't know all these guys, but I know LeBron 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.400
 and Dwayne and Chris. And one of the things I am proud of is that they are theirs 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.820
 roles as fathers seriously. And for all the young men out there who are looking for 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.820
 them all the time, for them to see someone who cares for their children and is there for 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.370
 put them out, day in and day out, which is a good message to send. This is a positive message to send out, 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.350
 and we are very proud of them for what. (Applause.) 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:29.350
 So much luck, again at the Miami Heat. And now we're going to take a photo 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.260
 make me look very short. (Laughter.) I'm used to, but first I have to go to 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.669
 asks Coach to say a few words. (Applause.) 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.669
 COACH Spoelstra: Well, on behalf of Micky Arison, Pat Riley, the entire Miami Heat organization, 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.590
 and our families, we would like to thank you for your hospitality in the white today 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.830
 Home and also inspired by the great men and women of the Walter Reed Hospital. 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.800
 We are honored and truly, truly humble to be here. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.150
 We actually hope this team serves as an inspiration to the nation that is a group 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.790
 can do, if you come together and sacrifice your egos for a greater purpose, to come together 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.970
 with a real hard hat work ethic, and able to persist through adversity and a 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.850
 whole heck of a lot of criticism - (laughs) - And still be able to reach the ultimate 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.389
 dream. 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.710
 THE PRESIDENT: Fantastic. Thank you so much. (Applause.) 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.040
 Mr. James: Am I supposed to say something? 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.040
 THE PRESIDENT: You can if you want. It's your world, man. (Laughter.) 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:49.330
 Mr. James: On behalf of myself and my teammates, we just want to thank you - around the back 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.870
 what SPO said - for the hospitality, which allows us to be, I mean, in the White House. 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.360
 I mean, we're in the White House. (Laughter.) And coach said - and the Prez said it real 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.360
 comfortable. So I mean, we're kids from Chicago Dallas, Texas, and Michigan and Ohio 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:15.419
 South Dakota - (lag) - Miami. And we're in the White House now. It's like, 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:22.810
 Hey, Mama, I made it. (Laughter and applause.) 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:30.979
 Mr. Wade: All I have to say is that we left a 10-day contract? 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.130
 THE PRESIDENT: Yes. 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.620
 Mr. Wade: Pick my husband. (Laughter.) 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.380
 THE PRESIDENT: You can use a shooter. (Laughter.) 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.780
 Mr. Wade: My point is waiting. (Laughter.) 

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:40.110
 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.)
