00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
hooks and at first I thought I would try

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.850 
hooks and at first I thought I would try
to<00:00:32.969> turn<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> crochet<00:00:33.719> hook<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.559> loom

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

tool but the smallest crochet hook even
after<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.809> amended<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.079> filed<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
after I amended it and filed it down a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.180 
after I amended it and filed it down a
little<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.510> coarse<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> nice

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
little bit was a bit coarse I got a nice

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.090 
little bit was a bit coarse I got a nice
shape<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> fine<00:00:46.110> gauge<00:00:46.410> loom<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100

this<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.360> coarse<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.989> work<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.440> between

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

this is a bit coarse to work in between
the<00:00:50.190> pegs<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> thought<00:00:52.050> well<00:00:52.530> I'd<00:00:52.710> really

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the pegs so I thought well I'd really

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.150 
the pegs so I thought well I'd really
like<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.370> back<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> real<00:00:54.059> limb<00:00:54.390> look<00:00:55.160> but

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
like to go back to a real limb look but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
like to go back to a real limb look but
I'd<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> use<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.270> handle<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> that's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I'd like to use this handle and that's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.430 
I'd like to use this handle and that's
not<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> designed<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.969> do

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
not it what what it is designed to do

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.509 
not it what what it is designed to do
however<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.620> did<00:01:02.039> manage<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:03.989> work

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
however I did manage to make it work

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
however I did manage to make it work
I've<00:01:05.519> been<00:01:05.729> thinking<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.299> loom<00:01:06.750> tools<00:01:07.140> and

so I just used these to bend that little

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.750 
so I just used these to bend that little
bit<00:02:51.500> right<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.189> pretty<00:02:53.459> tough

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760

but<00:02:54.060> with<00:02:54.419> strong<00:02:54.659> ends<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.169> can<00:02:55.349> do<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.650> if

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
but with strong ends you can do it if

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.979 
but with strong ends you can do it if
you<00:02:56.310> can't<00:02:56.579> do<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.879> probably<00:02:57.359> your<00:02:57.540> husband

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
you can't do it probably your husband

can then the ergonomic handle is

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.399 
can then the ergonomic handle is
supposed<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.120> work<00:03:03.329> like<00:03:03.659> this<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.200> comes

around<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:24.210> increase<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.900> size<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.409> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
around it to increase the size of the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.730 
around it to increase the size of the
Bank<00:04:26.790> so<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.210> will<00:04:28.389> fit<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.199> smallest

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
Bank so that it will fit the smallest

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.340 
Bank so that it will fit the smallest
washer<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.639> not<00:04:31.060> wiggle<00:04:31.449> around<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:34.350> now

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
washer and not wiggle around in it now

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.790 
washer and not wiggle around in it now
you<00:04:35.380> see<00:04:35.740> why<00:04:35.889> I<00:04:35.919> never<00:04:36.039> get<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> manicure<00:04:39.449> okay

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
you see why I never get a manicure okay

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.960 
you see why I never get a manicure okay
we're<00:04:41.800> not<00:04:41.919> going<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.250> looking<00:04:42.639> at<00:04:42.789> this

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
we're not going to be looking at this

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.060 
we're not going to be looking at this
again<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.750> doesn't<00:04:44.110> matter<00:04:44.320> much<00:04:44.740> how<00:04:44.949> it

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
again so it doesn't matter much how it

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.999 
again so it doesn't matter much how it
looks<00:04:45.310> as<00:04:45.550> long<00:04:45.729> as<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> works<00:04:46.650> make<00:04:47.650> sure<00:04:47.860> you

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
looks as long as it works make sure you

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.070 
looks as long as it works make sure you
put<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.520> through<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.910> top<00:04:49.120> first<00:04:49.509> I<00:04:49.810> found

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
put it in through the top first I found

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.460 
put it in through the top first I found
that<00:04:50.259> out<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.740> my<00:04:50.919> sorrow<00:04:52.110> here<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.259> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
that out to my sorrow here is the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.870 
that out to my sorrow here is the
correct<00:04:53.770> washer<00:04:56.280> let's<00:04:57.280> see<00:04:57.520> if<00:04:57.639> it'll<00:04:57.789> work

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
correct washer let's see if it'll work

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:11.670 
correct washer let's see if it'll work
up<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.510> there<00:05:05.130> that's<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.370> nice<00:05:06.550> snug<00:05:06.910> fit<00:05:10.620> now<00:05:11.620> I

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
up on there that's a nice snug fit now I

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.980 
up on there that's a nice snug fit now I
think<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:12.340> if<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:12.699> stack<00:05:13.330> these<00:05:13.690> other

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
think that if we stack these other

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.700 
think that if we stack these other
washers<00:05:15.690> we<00:05:16.690> should<00:05:16.930> be<00:05:17.110> able<00:05:17.260> to<00:05:17.440> adjust

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
washers we should be able to adjust

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.580 
washers we should be able to adjust
matters<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:19.539> as<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.840> get<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.020> fit<00:05:20.320> in<00:05:20.440> this

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
matters so as to get a fit in this

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.480 
matters so as to get a fit in this
handle<00:05:22.710> which<00:05:23.710> locks<00:05:24.039> into<00:05:24.400> positions<00:05:26.490> need

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
handle which locks into positions need

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.480 
handle which locks into positions need
more<00:05:27.699> washers

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.080 

and<00:05:32.759> we<00:05:33.330> need<00:05:33.509> this<00:05:33.690> one<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.110> be<00:05:34.729> farther<00:05:35.729> up

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
and we need this one to be farther up

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.900 
and we need this one to be farther up
the<00:05:36.270> shank

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:51.370 

all<00:05:42.750> right

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.220 

not<00:05:51.980> too<00:05:52.220> bad

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.900 

however<00:05:56.230> I<00:05:56.350> think<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:56.980> tool<00:05:57.190> is<00:05:57.460> sticking

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
however I think this tool is sticking

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.130 
however I think this tool is sticking
out<00:05:58.120> more<00:05:58.510> than<00:05:58.720> I'm<00:05:58.840> going<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:59.020> be

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
out more than I'm going to be

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.770 
out more than I'm going to be
comfortable<00:05:59.560> using<00:06:00.150> so<00:06:01.150> I'm<00:06:01.270> going<00:06:01.420> to<00:06:01.450> see<00:06:01.660> if

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
comfortable using so I'm going to see if

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.940 
comfortable using so I'm going to see if
I<00:06:01.930> can<00:06:02.670> press<00:06:03.670> down<00:06:04.020> pressing<00:06:05.020> down<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.650> try<00:06:05.890> to

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
I can press down pressing down to try to

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.400 
I can press down pressing down to try to
shorten<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.670> shank<00:06:07.000> or<00:06:07.450> the<00:06:07.810> amount<00:06:08.170> of<00:06:08.260> the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
shorten the shank or the amount of the

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:15.620 
shorten the shank or the amount of the
shank<00:06:08.680> that<00:06:08.770> sticks<00:06:09.190> out<00:06:09.430> of<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:09.670> handle

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.690 

that's<00:06:16.630> probably<00:06:17.200> positioning<00:06:18.160> it<00:06:18.310> about

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
that's probably positioning it about

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.620 
that's probably positioning it about
where<00:06:18.910> I<00:06:18.970> normally<00:06:19.570> grab<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:21.240> let's<00:06:22.240> give<00:06:22.450> this

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
where I normally grab it let's give this

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.670 
where I normally grab it let's give this
a<00:06:22.690> try<00:06:24.180> one<00:06:25.180> more<00:06:25.420> thing<00:06:25.480> I<00:06:26.020> think<00:06:26.320> I've<00:06:26.470> got<00:06:26.650> a

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
a try one more thing I think I've got a

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.940 
a try one more thing I think I've got a
couple<00:06:27.010> of<00:06:27.220> these<00:06:27.430> left<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.660> I'm<00:06:29.470> thinking

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
couple of these left and I'm thinking

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.410 
couple of these left and I'm thinking
that<00:06:30.160> since<00:06:30.490> I'm<00:06:30.640> not<00:06:30.790> planning<00:06:31.060> on<00:06:31.360> taking

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
that since I'm not planning on taking

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.970 
that since I'm not planning on taking
this<00:06:31.930> apart<00:06:32.410> again

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
this apart again

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.720 
this apart again
I'm<00:06:33.670> a<00:06:33.940> glue<00:06:34.300> one<00:06:34.570> of<00:06:34.750> them<00:06:34.960> on<00:06:35.400> probably<00:06:36.400> that

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
I'm a glue one of them on probably that

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.040 
I'm a glue one of them on probably that
one<00:06:36.970> to<00:06:37.870> the<00:06:37.900> end<00:06:38.200> to<00:06:38.680> cover<00:06:38.980> that<00:06:39.280> gap<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:40.050> the

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
one to the end to cover that gap and the

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.350 
one to the end to cover that gap and the
rest<00:06:41.290> of<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:41.620> duct<00:06:41.890> tape<00:06:41.980> I've<00:06:42.730> got<00:06:43.000> a<00:06:43.030> little

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
rest of the duct tape I've got a little

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.830 
rest of the duct tape I've got a little
bit<00:06:43.540> of<00:06:43.770> e6000<00:06:44.770> glue<00:06:44.800> here<00:06:45.220> which<00:06:45.490> is<00:06:45.720> one<00:06:46.720> of

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
bit of e6000 glue here which is one of

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.890 
bit of e6000 glue here which is one of
those<00:06:47.020> good<00:06:47.920> sturdy<00:06:48.250> glues<00:06:48.670> everybody<00:06:49.510> uses

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
those good sturdy glues everybody uses

00:06:49.900 --> 00:07:02.520 
those good sturdy glues everybody uses
for<00:06:50.110> everything<00:06:50.590> let's<00:06:50.920> see<00:06:51.190> how<00:06:51.370> it<00:06:51.550> works

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.120 

the<00:07:03.070> reason<00:07:03.460> I'm<00:07:03.640> choosing<00:07:03.700> the<00:07:04.300> green<00:07:04.570> one<00:07:04.840> is

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
the reason I'm choosing the green one is

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.400 
the reason I'm choosing the green one is
because<00:07:06.130> there's<00:07:06.340> a<00:07:06.430> smaller<00:07:06.910> hole<00:07:07.300> in<00:07:07.570> it<00:07:10.410> you

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
because there's a smaller hole in it you

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.770 
because there's a smaller hole in it you
smooth<00:07:11.800> that<00:07:12.130> out<00:07:14.730> smooth<00:07:15.730> them<00:07:16.030> out<00:07:16.180> up<00:07:16.420> here

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:16.780 
smooth that out smooth them out up here

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.130 
smooth that out smooth them out up here
to<00:07:16.960> help<00:07:17.170> it<00:07:17.380> stay<00:07:17.680> secure

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.140 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:30.020 

now<00:07:23.140> I'll<00:07:23.320> let<00:07:23.530> it<00:07:23.560> dry<00:07:23.920> and<00:07:24.430> see<00:07:24.940> how<00:07:25.120> it<00:07:25.270> knits

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.030 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.330 

yep<00:07:31.030> I<00:07:33.120> feel<00:07:34.120> it<00:07:34.570> likely<00:07:35.200> that<00:07:35.440> as<00:07:35.620> I<00:07:35.830> get<00:07:36.070> used

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 
yep I feel it likely that as I get used

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.950 
yep I feel it likely that as I get used
to<00:07:36.520> this<00:07:36.760> it<00:07:37.120> will<00:07:37.300> become<00:07:37.630> even<00:07:37.930> more

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
to this it will become even more

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.740 
to this it will become even more
efficient<00:07:38.710> don't<00:07:38.890> you<00:07:39.100> find<00:07:39.340> that's<00:07:39.550> how<00:07:39.820> most

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750

with<00:07:53.800> the<00:07:54.100> hook<00:07:54.310> and<00:07:54.580> I<00:07:55.120> do<00:07:55.180> think<00:07:55.750> that<00:07:55.870> it

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.230 
with the hook and I do think that it

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.040 
with the hook and I do think that it

than<00:08:03.790> I<00:08:03.910> added<00:08:04.420> four<00:08:04.960> looms<00:08:05.440> other<00:08:05.860> than<00:08:06.250> kiss

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:06.550
