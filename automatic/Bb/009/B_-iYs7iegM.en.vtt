like<00:00:07.759> we're<00:00:08.269> looking<00:00:08.420> at<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:08.780> Blackmagic

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
like we're looking at the Blackmagic

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.970 
like we're looking at the Blackmagic
studio<00:00:10.040> camera<00:00:10.580> here<00:00:10.790> now<00:00:11.750> they<00:00:12.590> built<00:00:12.860> that

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
studio camera here now they built that

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.000 
studio camera here now they built that
with<00:00:13.100> a<00:00:13.129> Micro<00:00:13.520> Four<00:00:13.760> Thirds<00:00:13.790> mount<00:00:14.420> but<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.709> lot

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
with a Micro Four Thirds mount but a lot

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.590 
with a Micro Four Thirds mount but a lot
of<00:00:16.039> studio<00:00:16.490> cameras<00:00:16.940> need<00:00:17.119> a<00:00:17.150> lot<00:00:17.390> more<00:00:17.420> than

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
of studio cameras need a lot more than

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.109 
of studio cameras need a lot more than
mic<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:18.110> thought<00:00:18.320> there's<00:00:18.590> mount<00:00:18.980> tell<00:00:19.760> us<00:00:19.910> what

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
mic I thought there's mount tell us what

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.420 
mic I thought there's mount tell us what
this<00:00:20.330> wonderful<00:00:21.140> innovative<00:00:21.710> solution

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
this wonderful innovative solution

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.910 
this wonderful innovative solution
you've<00:00:22.609> come<00:00:22.820> up<00:00:22.850> with<00:00:23.000> just<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:24.320> let<00:00:24.530> us<00:00:24.560> put

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
you've come up with just to let us put

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.830 
you've come up with just to let us put
what<00:00:25.580> would<00:00:25.730> traditionally<00:00:25.910> be<00:00:26.300> a<00:00:26.420> studio

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
what would traditionally be a studio

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.410 
what would traditionally be a studio
lens<00:00:27.200> on<00:00:27.680> what<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.130> studio<00:00:28.550> camera<00:00:28.970> okay

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
lens on what is a studio camera okay

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.120 
lens on what is a studio camera okay
well<00:00:29.570> what<00:00:29.720> we've<00:00:29.869> got<00:00:30.050> here<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:30.530> is<00:00:30.770> what<00:00:31.010> we

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
well what we've got here is is what we

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.340 
well what we've got here is is what we
call<00:00:31.369> the<00:00:32.360> b4<00:00:32.780> super<00:00:33.620> 16<00:00:34.100> 2<00:00:34.460> Micro<00:00:34.820> Four<00:00:35.000> Thirds

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
call the b4 super 16 2 Micro Four Thirds

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.410 
call the b4 super 16 2 Micro Four Thirds
now<00:00:36.350> we<00:00:36.440> call<00:00:36.710> it<00:00:36.890> super<00:00:37.190> 16<00:00:37.640> because<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
now we call it super 16 because the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.099 
now we call it super 16 because the
optics<00:00:38.960> inside<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.710> adapter<00:00:40.420> are<00:00:41.420> optimized

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
optics inside the adapter are optimized

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.790 
optics inside the adapter are optimized
for<00:00:42.370> super<00:00:43.370> 16<00:00:43.850> all<00:00:44.059> sensors<00:00:44.960> of<00:00:45.140> around<00:00:45.559> about

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
for super 16 all sensors of around about

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.790 
for super 16 all sensors of around about
the<00:00:45.949> same<00:00:46.159> size<00:00:46.809> which<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:48.170> Blackmagic

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
the same size which this Blackmagic

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.919 
the same size which this Blackmagic
studio<00:00:49.190> camera<00:00:49.579> is<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:52.389> the<00:00:53.389> clever<00:00:53.690> part

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
studio camera is the the clever part

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.469 
studio camera is the the clever part
about<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:54.769> adapter<00:00:55.339> is<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.729> does<00:00:56.210> two

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
about this this adapter is it does two

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.180 
about this this adapter is it does two
things<00:00:57.069> first<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:59.149> optics<00:00:59.539> in<00:00:59.719> here<00:01:00.190> expands

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
things first the optics in here expands

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.910 
things first the optics in here expands
the<00:01:01.370> image<00:01:01.719> from<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.839> lens<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.530> cover<00:01:03.739> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
the image from the lens to cover the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.280 
the image from the lens to cover the
sensor<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.420> way<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.979> can<00:01:07.190> use<00:01:07.400> your<00:01:07.430> lens

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
sensor so that way you can use your lens

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.899 
sensor so that way you can use your lens
with<00:01:09.290> angles<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.979> view<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.280> you're<00:01:10.490> used<00:01:10.760> to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
with angles of view that you're used to

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.190 
with angles of view that you're used to
so<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:12.229> instance<00:01:12.500> we've<00:01:12.979> got<00:01:13.719> Canon<00:01:14.719> HJ

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
so in this instance we've got Canon HJ

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.100 
so in this instance we've got Canon HJ
11<00:01:15.560> times<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.250> it's<00:01:17.030> pretty<00:01:17.240> wide<00:01:17.479> lens<00:01:17.750> and

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
11 times and it's pretty wide lens and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.340 
11 times and it's pretty wide lens and
it<00:01:18.229> will<00:01:18.350> still<00:01:18.619> be<00:01:18.649> wired<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.750> second<00:01:21.170> thing

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
it will still be wired the second thing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.389 
it will still be wired the second thing
that<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.130> optics<00:01:22.490> do<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:24.399> it

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
that the the the optics do is it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.179 
that the the the optics do is it
corrects<00:01:25.939> for<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.329> fact<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.950> camera

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
corrects for the fact that the camera

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.429 
corrects for the fact that the camera
doesn't<00:01:28.520> have<00:01:28.759> a<00:01:28.789> beam<00:01:29.000> splitter<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:30.140> be

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
doesn't have a beam splitter they be

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.679 
doesn't have a beam splitter they be
four<00:01:30.680> lenses<00:01:30.939> generally<00:01:31.939> work<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.509> three

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
four lenses generally work with three

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.080 
four lenses generally work with three
chip<00:01:32.899> cameras<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.189> optically<00:01:34.729> they're

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
chip cameras so optically they're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.169 
chip cameras so optically they're
optimized<00:01:36.049> to<00:01:36.890> work<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.429> conjunction<00:01:37.640> with

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
optimized to work in conjunction with

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.270 
optimized to work in conjunction with
the<00:01:38.270> beam<00:01:38.450> splitter<00:01:38.630> inside<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.560> camera

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the beam splitter inside the camera

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.550 
the beam splitter inside the camera
so<00:01:40.880> now<00:01:41.300> we've<00:01:41.480> got<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.630> camera<00:01:41.990> with<00:01:42.140> no<00:01:42.260> beam

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
so now we've got a camera with no beam

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.010 
so now we've got a camera with no beam
splitter<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:44.120> fact<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.540> there<00:01:44.690> isn't<00:01:44.810> it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
splitter the fact that there isn't it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.840 
splitter the fact that there isn't it
being<00:01:45.200> Spitzer<00:01:45.590> has<00:01:45.770> to<00:01:45.890> be<00:01:46.010> compensated<00:01:46.370> for

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
being Spitzer has to be compensated for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.530 
being Spitzer has to be compensated for
so<00:01:47.750> that's<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.140> second<00:01:48.530> thing<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.740> this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
so that's the second thing that this

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.070 
so that's the second thing that this
adapter<00:01:50.540> does<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.110> as<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:52.040> see<00:01:53.080> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
adapter does and as you can see the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.740 
adapter does and as you can see the
images<00:01:54.410> are<00:01:54.680> pretty<00:01:55.280> good<00:01:55.520> even<00:01:56.360> at<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.570> wide

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
images are pretty good even at the wide

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.170 
images are pretty good even at the wide
ends<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.369> once<00:01:58.610> you've<00:01:58.790> got<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.000> lens

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
ends you know once you've got the lens

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900 
ends you know once you've got the lens
on<00:01:59.420> there<00:01:59.600> simply<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.650> just<00:02:01.280> make<00:02:01.550> sure<00:02:01.729> you

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
on there simply it I just make sure you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.740 
on there simply it I just make sure you
back<00:02:02.090> focus<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.660> set<00:02:02.840> as<00:02:03.020> normal<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.750> yeah

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
back focus is set as normal and yeah

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.359 
back focus is set as normal and yeah
it's<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:07.310> works<00:02:07.670> very<00:02:08.060> well<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.250> at<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's it works very well and at the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.060 
it's it works very well and at the
moment<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:10.820> it's<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.600> very<00:02:12.470> popular<00:02:12.800> thing

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
moment it's it's a very popular thing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.699 
moment it's it's a very popular thing
that<00:02:13.430> people<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.760> looking<00:02:14.030> at<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:15.470> very

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
that people are looking at it's very

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.949 
that people are looking at it's very
impressive<00:02:15.980> now<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.760> there<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> conversion

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
impressive now is there a conversion

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.750 
impressive now is there a conversion
factor<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.560> creeps<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.610> you're

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
factor that creeps in because you're

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
factor as such because what's going on

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.810 
factor as such because what's going on
is<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:30.320> bit<00:02:30.530> unorthodox<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.670> we've

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
is a little bit unorthodox in that we've

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.550 
is a little bit unorthodox in that we've
got<00:02:32.000> an<00:02:32.090> adapter<00:02:32.330> that's<00:02:32.690> stretching<00:02:33.080> an

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
got an adapter that's stretching an

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.270 
got an adapter that's stretching an
existing<00:02:34.430> image<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.410> way<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> think<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.130> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
existing image so the way to think of it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.250 
existing image so the way to think of it
is<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.700> angle<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.180> view<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.900> normally

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
is the angle of view that you normally

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.229 
is the angle of view that you normally
get<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.680> lens<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:41.180> retains<00:02:41.800> so

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
get with that lens that is retains so

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.270 
get with that lens that is retains so
that's<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.510> most<00:02:44.980> practical<00:02:45.980> way<00:02:46.010> of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's the most practical way of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.699 
that's the most practical way of
thinking<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.060> really<00:02:47.290> well<00:02:48.290> if<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
thinking about it really well if the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.440 
thinking about it really well if the
angle<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.100> view<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.430> retained<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.060> means<00:02:50.269> you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
angle of view is retained that means you

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.910 
angle of view is retained that means you
get<00:02:50.660> what<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.959> expect<00:02:51.080> it's<00:02:51.709> that's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
get what you expect it's that's

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.650 
get what you expect it's that's
fantastic<00:02:52.549> because<00:02:52.670> more<00:02:53.000> often<00:02:53.239> than<00:02:53.390> not<00:02:53.420> we

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
fantastic because more often than not we

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.440 
fantastic because more often than not we
end<00:02:53.810> up<00:02:53.959> with<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.350> doubling<00:02:55.070> or<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.340> 1.5<00:02:56.150> times

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
end up with a doubling or a 1.5 times

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.479 
end up with a doubling or a 1.5 times
conversion<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.290> suddenly<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.130> don't<00:02:58.250> have

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
conversion and suddenly you don't have

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.860 
conversion and suddenly you don't have
to<00:02:58.610> widen<00:02:58.790> you've<00:02:59.150> got<00:02:59.299> more<00:02:59.420> telling<00:02:59.780> which

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
to widen you've got more telling which

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.110 
to widen you've got more telling which
you<00:02:59.959> might<00:03:00.080> not<00:03:00.290> mean<00:03:00.500> that's<00:03:00.830> right<00:03:01.100> yes<00:03:01.459> that

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you might not mean that's right yes that

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.430 
you might not mean that's right yes that
looks<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.420> really<00:03:02.660> good<00:03:02.840> solution

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
looks like a really good solution

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.750 
looks like a really good solution
yeah<00:03:03.769> they<00:03:03.920> aren't<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> only<00:03:04.220> thing<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.610> be

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
yeah they aren't the only thing to be

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.150 
yeah they aren't the only thing to be
aware<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:05.690> some<00:03:06.500> light<00:03:06.739> loss<00:03:06.980> but

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
aware of is there some light loss but

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.600 
aware of is there some light loss but
it's<00:03:07.370> only<00:03:07.549> about<00:03:08.180> point<00:03:08.630> seven<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.170> stop

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
it's only about point seven of the stop

it's only about point seven of the stop
there's<00:03:10.610> nothing<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.090> can<00:03:11.239> do<00:03:11.360> about<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.600> so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
there's nothing we can do about that so

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780 
there's nothing we can do about that so
laws<00:03:12.079> of<00:03:12.260> physics<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.920> lot<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.430> those<00:03:13.579> before

really good quality
it's<00:03:38.640> what<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.880> use<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.630> they<00:03:40.080> don't<00:03:40.320> fail<00:03:40.560> I

know it sounds like a cell but what you

know it sounds like a cell but what you
