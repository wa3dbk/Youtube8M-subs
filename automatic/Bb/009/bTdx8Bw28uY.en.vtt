with<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.159> know<00:03:47.189> changing<00:03:47.579> them<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
with the you know changing them to the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.910 
with the you know changing them to the
drop<00:03:48.599> because<00:03:48.780> changing<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.650> slightly

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
drop because changing it to a slightly

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.940 
drop because changing it to a slightly
bigger<00:03:50.189> at<00:03:50.370> 7:56<00:03:50.879> longer<00:03:51.329> cooking<00:03:51.540> time

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
bigger at 7:56 longer cooking time

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.339 
bigger at 7:56 longer cooking time
otherwise<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.159> 12<00:03:53.579> drinks<00:03:53.819> a<00:03:54.659> standard<00:03:55.170> set

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
otherwise the 12 drinks a standard set

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.629 
otherwise the 12 drinks a standard set
the<00:03:55.620> Jade<00:03:55.980> 39<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.950> everything<00:03:59.310> else<00:03:59.459> is

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
the Jade 39 and and everything else is

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.550 
the Jade 39 and and everything else is
suited<00:03:59.909> sort<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.329> I<00:04:00.540> pieced<00:04:00.959> together<00:04:01.079> stuff

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
suited sort of I pieced together stuff

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.960 
suited sort of I pieced together stuff

just like for instance on this might be

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.770 
just like for instance on this might be
hard<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:10.810> it's<00:04:12.880> real<00:04:13.880> difference<00:04:14.270> at<00:04:14.360> 16<00:04:14.750> on
