00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
electronics and I'm here to demo the ds1

plexi<00:00:22.200> mod<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:23.060> I'm<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.270> show<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
plexi mod we have I'm going to show you

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.910 
plexi mod we have I'm going to show you
the<00:00:24.450> range<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> pedal<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> gain<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.710> ten

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the range of the pedal the gain the ten

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.430 
the range of the pedal the gain the ten
controls<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:27.390> basically<00:00:27.780> have<00:00:28.430> chunky

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
controls we basically have chunky

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.530 
controls we basically have chunky
sounded<00:00:31.440> kind<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.010> plexi<00:00:32.430> tone<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> smooth

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sounded kind of plexi tone with a smooth

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.960 
sounded kind of plexi tone with a smooth
top<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.080> and<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.670> gain

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
top in and it has a little bit more gain

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.690 
top in and it has a little bit more gain
and<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.630> stock<00:00:36.930> plexi<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.370> it's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
and you know stock plexi so it's it's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.210 
and you know stock plexi so it's it's
definitely<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.390> modest<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.260> takes<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
definitely more modest and takes a

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.990 
definitely more modest and takes a
decent<00:00:42.059> pedal<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.040> makes<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> tone<00:00:44.700> control

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
decent pedal and makes the tone control

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.260 
decent pedal and makes the tone control
fully<00:00:45.210> usable<00:00:46.760> take<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.150> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
fully usable take some of the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
fully usable take some of the
compression<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.050> game<00:00:49.290> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
compression out of the game so that is a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
compression out of the game so that is a
more<00:00:51.030> dynamic<00:00:51.240> pick<00:00:51.870> sensitive<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.560> well<00:00:52.590> as

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
more dynamic pick sensitive as well as

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.690 
more dynamic pick sensitive as well as
you<00:00:53.700> know<00:00:53.820> sensitive<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.230> volume<00:00:56.040> on

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
you know sensitive to your volume on

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.580 
you know sensitive to your volume on
your<00:00:56.850> guitar<00:00:56.970> and<00:00:57.450> I'll<00:00:57.810> argue<00:00:57.990> pick<00:00:58.290> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
your guitar and I'll argue pick and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.530 
your guitar and I'll argue pick and
stuff<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.400> let<00:01:00.000> me<00:01:00.090> show<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
stuff so let me show you some of that

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.620 
stuff so let me show you some of that
the<00:01:01.530> gain<00:01:01.710> range<00:01:01.920> first

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.270 

the<00:01:06.320> game<00:01:06.530> range<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.860> a<00:01:06.920> little<00:01:07.100> bit<00:01:07.190> more

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
the game range is a little bit more

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.590 
the game range is a little bit more
dynamic<00:01:07.730> in<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.910> latter<00:01:08.120> half<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.450> pot

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
dynamic in the latter half of the pot

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.950 
dynamic in the latter half of the pot
it's<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.990> little<00:01:09.320> late<00:01:09.440> swing<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.720> from<00:01:11.720> 12

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
it's a little late swing to it from 12

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:29.310 
it's a little late swing to it from 12
o'clock<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.410> below<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.830> pretty<00:01:13.100> light

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:52.630 

here<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:30.350> changed<00:01:31.010> my<00:01:31.100> pickup<00:01:31.369> selector

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:13.110 

taking<00:01:53.640> around<00:01:53.820> 2<00:01:54.060> o'clock

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.809 

mmm-hmm

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.360 

okay<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:22.840> there's<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.349> gain<00:02:23.530> range<00:02:23.799> let's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
okay so there's the gain range let's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.059 
okay so there's the gain range let's
take<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.549> look<00:02:24.790> at<00:02:25.439> the<00:02:26.439> tone<00:02:26.650> range<00:02:27.390> now<00:02:28.390> I've

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
take a look at the tone range now I've

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.589 
take a look at the tone range now I've
mounted<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:31.090> more<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.569> a

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
mounted this so that it's more of a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.960 
mounted this so that it's more of a
mid-range<00:02:32.200> sweep<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.010> you're<00:02:33.549> going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.760> put

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
mid-range sweep and you're going to put

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.490 
mid-range sweep and you're going to put
the<00:02:34.060> all<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.360> way<00:02:34.450> down<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.840> mid-range<00:02:35.110> place

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the all the way down the mid-range place

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.119 
the all the way down the mid-range place
pretty<00:02:35.680> low

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
pretty low

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.890 
pretty low
it<00:02:36.189> sounds<00:02:36.489> really<00:02:36.640> dark<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.569> it's<00:02:37.689> kind<00:02:37.840> of

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
it sounds really dark but it's kind of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.830 
it sounds really dark but it's kind of
cool<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.220> has<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.970> real<00:02:40.209> warm<00:02:40.420> crunchy<00:02:40.720> kind

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
cool and it has a real warm crunchy kind

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:51.550 
cool and it has a real warm crunchy kind
of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:09.920 

Oh

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.700 

that's<00:03:10.930> pretty<00:03:11.080> nice<00:03:11.260> there

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.800 

you<00:03:14.580> notice<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.910> little<00:03:15.000> bit<00:03:15.180> more<00:03:15.360> clarity<00:03:15.570> as

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you notice a little bit more clarity as

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.210 
you notice a little bit more clarity as
the<00:03:15.960> mid-range

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.550 

you<00:03:23.180> think<00:03:23.390> of<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.540> more<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.870> way<00:03:24.050> instead<00:03:24.320> of

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
you think of it more this way instead of

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.350 
you think of it more this way instead of
a<00:03:24.770> boost<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.430> mid-range<00:03:25.610> we're<00:03:26.000> sweeping

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
a boost in the mid-range we're sweeping

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.069 
a boost in the mid-range we're sweeping
it

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.640

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:04:06.680 

nice<00:03:36.650> clarity

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.750
