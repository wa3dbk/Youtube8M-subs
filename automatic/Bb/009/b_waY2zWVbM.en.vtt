enzyme<00:01:56.909> blend<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.259> helps<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> amino

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
enzyme blend in it that helps the amino

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
acids be utilized and absorb so much

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.060 
acids be utilized and absorb so much
easier<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.969> 200<00:02:03.869> 300<00:02:04.049> %<00:02:04.469> batter<00:02:04.680> by<00:02:04.890> your

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
easier like 200 300 % batter by your

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
easier like 200 300 % batter by your
body<00:02:05.250> I've<00:02:06.030> noticed<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.719> from<00:02:06.930> adding<00:02:07.200> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
body I've noticed just from adding this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.770 
body I've noticed just from adding this
and<00:02:07.710> increasing<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.340> protein<00:02:08.759> out<00:02:08.910> take<00:02:09.149> our

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and increasing my protein out take our

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.940 
and increasing my protein out take our
intake

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
intake

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.550 
intake
pretty<00:02:11.220> good<00:02:11.730> differences<00:02:12.240> thus<00:02:12.690> far<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pretty good differences thus far and I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.260 
pretty good differences thus far and I
look<00:02:13.830> forward<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.310> adding<00:02:14.640> more<00:02:14.819> protein

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
look forward to just adding more protein

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.100 
look forward to just adding more protein
because<00:02:16.140> yes<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.220> do<00:02:17.370> need<00:02:17.490> protein<00:02:17.970> how<00:02:18.840> much

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
because yes you do need protein how much

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.309 
because yes you do need protein how much
that<00:02:19.709> depends<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.569> usually<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.900> could<00:02:22.050> stand

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
that depends but usually we could stand

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.520 
that depends but usually we could stand
to<00:02:22.560> eat<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> little<00:02:22.860> bit<00:02:23.069> more<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.580> course<00:02:24.530> this

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
to eat a little bit more of course this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.560 
to eat a little bit more of course this
is<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:25.709> my<00:02:25.890> opinion<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.610> my<00:02:26.819> experience<00:02:27.360> over

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
is just my opinion in my experience over

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.600 
is just my opinion in my experience over
the<00:02:27.720> last<00:02:27.930> couple<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.410> months<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.980> over<00:02:29.490> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
the last couple of months and over the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.280 
the last couple of months and over the
last<00:02:29.730> couple<00:02:29.940> years<00:02:30.120> being<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.600> vegan<00:02:30.810> low

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
last couple years being on a vegan low

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.010 
last couple years being on a vegan low
protein<00:02:31.590> diet<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.490> see<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> difference<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
protein diet I can see the difference so

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.550 
protein diet I can see the difference so
that's<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.070> next<00:02:35.910> ingredient<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:37.380> make

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
that's that and next ingredient to make

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.590 
that's that and next ingredient to make
this<00:02:37.830> creamy<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.670> delicious<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.330> gonna<00:02:39.480> be

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
this creamy and delicious it's gonna be

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.280 
this creamy and delicious it's gonna be
some<00:02:39.780> lucuma<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:41.630> i'm<00:02:42.630> gonna<00:02:42.750> add<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.260> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
some lucuma and i'm gonna add like a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.070 
some lucuma and i'm gonna add like a
tablespoon<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.090> because<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.750> gonna<00:02:45.930> be

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
tablespoon of that because it's gonna be

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.979 
tablespoon of that because it's gonna be
sweet<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.440> creamy<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> delicious<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.989> I

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
sweet and creamy and delicious and I

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.410 
sweet and creamy and delicious and I
will<00:02:49.650> say<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.100> adding<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.519> way<00:02:50.730> into<00:02:51.269> this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
will say that adding the way into this

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
will say that adding the way into this
drink<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.830> adding<00:02:53.130> some<00:02:53.160> colostrum

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
drink and then adding some colostrum

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.570 
drink and then adding some colostrum
into<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.660> chai<00:02:55.220> because<00:02:56.220> China<00:02:56.519> is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
into this chai because China is

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030 
into this chai because China is
traditionally<00:02:57.120> made<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.360> milk<00:02:57.920> adding<00:02:58.920> in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
traditionally made with milk adding in

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.680 
traditionally made with milk adding in
these<00:02:59.190> dairy<00:02:59.550> products<00:03:00.060> are<00:03:00.269> gonna<00:03:00.360> make<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
these dairy products are gonna make this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410 
these dairy products are gonna make this
dream<00:03:00.930> taste<00:03:01.260> very<00:03:01.560> milky<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.120> it'll<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
dream taste very milky so it'll be a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.560 
dream taste very milky so it'll be a
very<00:03:03.930> authentic<00:03:04.350> Thai<00:03:04.800> flavor<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
very authentic Thai flavor and if you

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.820 
very authentic Thai flavor and if you
didn't<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.959> use<00:03:07.140> these<00:03:07.350> things<00:03:07.590> you

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
didn't want to use these things you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.740 
didn't want to use these things you
could<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.130> use<00:03:08.310> coconut<00:03:08.610> oil<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.420> hemp

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
could just use coconut oil and hemp

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.120 
could just use coconut oil and hemp
seeds<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.230> you're<00:03:10.320> gonna<00:03:10.410> get<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.650> very<00:03:10.890> creamy

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
seeds and you're gonna get a very creamy

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.100 
seeds and you're gonna get a very creamy
milky<00:03:11.820> texture<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.980> with<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:15.420> next<00:03:15.900> I'm

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
milky texture just with that so next I'm

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.190 
milky texture just with that so next I'm
gonna<00:03:16.170> add<00:03:16.410> some<00:03:16.440> maca<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.670> yes<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.690> going<00:03:19.049> to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
gonna add some maca and yes I'm going to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.960 
gonna add some maca and yes I'm going to
add<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.680> three<00:03:19.950> or<00:03:20.070> four<00:03:20.130> tablespoons<00:03:20.459> of

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
add like three or four tablespoons of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.039 
add like three or four tablespoons of
maca<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.470> that's<00:03:22.650> probably<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.400> two<00:03:24.049> and

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
maca so that's probably like two and

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.130 
maca so that's probably like two and
then<00:03:25.560> another<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:28.560> another

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
then another two and then another

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.580 
then another two and then another
that'll<00:03:31.140> be<00:03:31.230> it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that'll be it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.100 
that'll be it
okay<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.950> may<00:03:32.070> be<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.220> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:33.110> because

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
okay I may be a little bit more because

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.400 
okay I may be a little bit more because
maca<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.820> root<00:03:36.030> vegetable<00:03:36.269> unless<00:03:37.230> you're

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
maca it's a root vegetable unless you're

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.620 
maca it's a root vegetable unless you're
working<00:03:37.590> with<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> concentrated<00:03:38.459> extract<00:03:39.000> you

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
working with a concentrated extract you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.150 
working with a concentrated extract you
need<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.900> eat<00:03:39.989> tablespoons<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> tablespoons

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
need to eat tablespoons the tablespoons

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.150 
need to eat tablespoons the tablespoons
to<00:03:41.400> really<00:03:41.700> feel<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> magic<00:03:42.350> 3<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.470> 6<00:03:43.769> is

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
to really feel the magic 3 to 6 is

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.979 
to really feel the magic 3 to 6 is
optimal<00:03:44.700> anything<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:45.269> than<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.810> don't

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
optimal anything more than that I don't

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.560 
optimal anything more than that I don't
know<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.170> haven't<00:03:46.440> done<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.890> but<00:03:47.040> 3<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.459> 6<00:03:47.700> seems

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
know I haven't done it but 3 to 6 seems

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.560 
know I haven't done it but 3 to 6 seems
to<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> range<00:03:49.140> to<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:49.860> them<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.370> most

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
to be the range to get them the most

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.140 
to be the range to get them the most
noticeable<00:03:51.570> effects<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.489> course<00:03:53.670> maca<00:03:53.970> is

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
noticeable effects and of course maca is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.900 
noticeable effects and of course maca is
