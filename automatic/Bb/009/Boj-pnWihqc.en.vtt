honestly don't know a lot of stuff about

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.960 
honestly don't know a lot of stuff about
computers<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.440> technology<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.700> what<00:03:35.940> I

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
computers of in technology like what I

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.789 
computers of in technology like what I
know<00:03:36.090> now<00:03:36.389> take<00:03:36.720> me<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> really<00:03:37.319> long<00:03:37.500> time<00:03:37.769> to

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
know now take me a really long time to

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.189 
know now take me a really long time to
learn<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:39.000> what<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.299> average<00:03:39.450> person<00:03:39.989> can

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
learn like what the average person can

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.890 
learn like what the average person can
learn<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:40.500> ten<00:03:40.680> minutes<00:03:40.829> takes<00:03:41.370> me<00:03:41.549> like

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
learn in ten minutes takes me like

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.210 
learn in ten minutes takes me like
thirty<00:03:42.900> cuz<00:03:43.319> I'm<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.680> held<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.889> bad<00:03:44.040> with

thirty cuz I'm just held a bad with

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.240 
thirty cuz I'm just held a bad with
technology<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:45.440> slow<00:03:46.440> learner<00:03:46.680> at<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.010> and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
technology a slow learner at that and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.849 
technology a slow learner at that and
nobody<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.940> got<00:03:48.419> that<00:03:48.629> heed<00:03:48.780> what's<00:03:49.709> gonna

black ops I just need a break from it

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.839 
black ops I just need a break from it
now<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.889> then<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.190> know<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.310> mean<00:03:59.639> first

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
now and then you know I mean first

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.720 
now and then you know I mean first
strike<00:04:00.150> yeah<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:00.870> five<00:04:01.049> days<00:04:01.260> ago<00:04:01.730> I'll

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
strike yeah so five days ago I'll

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.610 
strike yeah so five days ago I'll
probably<00:04:02.910> play<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.389> game<00:04:03.810> Morgan<00:04:04.319> when<00:04:04.530> the

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
probably play that game Morgan when the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.650 
probably play that game Morgan when the
matpat<00:04:04.980> comes<00:04:05.310> out<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.209> believe<00:04:06.480> they're

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
matpat comes out and I believe they're

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.379 
matpat comes out and I believe they're
doing<00:04:06.780> form<00:04:07.139> at<00:04:07.290> PAX<00:04:07.699> so<00:04:08.699> they've<00:04:08.970> got<00:04:09.150> three

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
doing form at PAX so they've got three

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.920 
doing form at PAX so they've got three
left<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:10.079> I'll<00:04:11.010> probably<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.549> I'm<00:04:12.359> guessing

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
left and I'll probably do I'm guessing

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.210 
left and I'll probably do I'm guessing
they'll<00:04:13.049> release<00:04:13.260> another<00:04:13.560> map<00:04:13.799> pack<00:04:14.040> around

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
they'll release another map pack around

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.629 
they'll release another map pack around
April<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:14.849> something<00:04:15.269> that's<00:04:15.480> my<00:04:15.750> guess<00:04:16.639> early

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
April or something that's my guess early

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.819 
April or something that's my guess early
April<00:04:18.000> I'd<00:04:18.120> say<00:04:18.359> so<00:04:19.289> yeah<00:04:19.440> I'm<00:04:19.560> looking

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
April I'd say so yeah I'm looking

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.440 
April I'd say so yeah I'm looking
forward<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.099> that<00:04:20.280> whenever<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.969> comes<00:04:21.150> out

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
forward to that whenever it comes out

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.690 
forward to that whenever it comes out
but<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.440> know<00:04:22.560> you'll<00:04:22.770> see<00:04:22.830> black<00:04:23.070> ops<00:04:23.370> now
