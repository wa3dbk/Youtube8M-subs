00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.170 
of people are having the same trouble
and<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.219> pissed<00:00:35.430> off<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.880> Apple

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

hasn't publicly addressed the problem

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.750 
hasn't publicly addressed the problem
but<00:00:39.379> it's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> simple<00:00:40.829> fix<00:00:41.040> okay<00:00:42.260> if<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> set<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
but it's a simple fix okay if you set it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.450 
but it's a simple fix okay if you set it
up<00:00:45.289> initially<00:00:46.610> by<00:00:47.610> backing<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.809> your

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
up initially by backing it up to your

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.920 
up initially by backing it up to your
iPhone<00:00:50.460> 4<00:00:50.789> or<00:00:50.820> 4s<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.750> example<00:00:53.629> that's<00:00:54.629> where

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
iPhone 4 or 4s for example that's where

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510 
iPhone 4 or 4s for example that's where
the<00:00:55.020> problem<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> AT&amp;T<00:00:57.360> guy<00:00:58.370> told<00:00:59.370> me

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the problem is and the AT&amp;T guy told me

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
the problem is and the AT&amp;T guy told me
that's<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> should<00:01:00.539> set<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.140> phone<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that's how I should set my phone up so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.340 
that's how I should set my phone up so
just<00:01:02.309> back<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> backup<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:03.960> four

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just back it up do a backup of your four

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
just back it up do a backup of your four
and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.939> know<00:01:05.939> put<00:01:06.360> everything<00:01:06.479> into

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and then you know put everything into

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
and then you know put everything into
the<00:01:07.080> five<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:09.060> means<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.420> five<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the five well that means the five is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
the five well that means the five is
getting<00:01:09.900> stuff<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.590> shouldn't<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
getting stuff that it shouldn't get and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.740 
getting stuff that it shouldn't get and
the<00:01:12.150> processor

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the processor

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.270 
the processor
I<00:01:12.900> guess<00:01:13.290> gets<00:01:13.560> confused<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.400> whatever<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I guess gets confused or whatever so the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.340 
I guess gets confused or whatever so the
simple<00:01:17.729> fix<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:19.700> restore<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> phone<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
simple fix is restore the phone do a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
simple fix is restore the phone do a
factory<00:01:22.830> reset<00:01:24.830> plug<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.070> iTunes<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
factory reset plug it into iTunes and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.520 
factory reset plug it into iTunes and
set<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> new<00:01:28.680> phone<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
set it up as a new phone all right and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
set it up as a new phone all right and
then<00:01:31.530> you'll<00:01:31.710> notice<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.430> huge<00:01:32.939> huge

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
then you'll notice a huge huge

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
then you'll notice a huge huge
improvement<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.610> as

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
improvement I mean then it's as good as

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.810 
improvement I mean then it's as good as
the<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.630> keynote<00:01:37.079> speech<00:01:37.470> says<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> which

nights ago and eight hours later after

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.620 
nights ago and eight hours later after
I'd<00:01:53.700> unplugged<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.360> eight<00:01:54.990> hours<00:01:55.380> later<00:01:56.630> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
I'd unplugged them eight hours later the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.719

that was kind of it's good if you've got

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.830 
that was kind of it's good if you've got
your<00:02:16.340> old<00:02:16.459> one<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.940> know<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.390> kind<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.690> do

your old one you know you can kind of do

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.259 
your old one you know you can kind of do
the<00:02:17.959> comparison<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.890> how<00:02:19.340> much<00:02:19.519> is<00:02:19.730> leeching

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
the comparison of how much is leeching

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.690 
the comparison of how much is leeching
how<00:02:21.140> much<00:02:21.290> power<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.709> being<00:02:21.739> lost<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.580> know

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
how much power is being lost you know

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.509 
how much power is being lost you know
compared<00:02:23.299> to<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.569> old<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:25.250> what

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
compared to the old one and then what

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.690 
compared to the old one and then what
you<00:02:25.610> do<00:02:25.760> is<00:02:25.790> your<00:02:26.090> restore<00:02:26.599> right<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.700> then

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
you do is your restore right and then

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.670 
you do is your restore right and then
you<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.360> same<00:02:29.540> thing<00:02:29.750> again<00:02:30.049> about<00:02:30.260> 10

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
you do the same thing again about 10
