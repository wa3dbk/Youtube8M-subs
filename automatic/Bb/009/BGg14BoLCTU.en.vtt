they<00:01:50.789> are<00:01:50.820> exactly<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.110> movie<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
they are exactly like the movie I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.010 
they are exactly like the movie I
believe<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> final<00:01:53.909> episode<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.360> Goku

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
believe the final episode of Goku

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.310 
believe the final episode of Goku
returns<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.530> earth<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.810> that's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.109> bit

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
returns to earth so that's a little bit

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.819 
returns to earth so that's a little bit
beyond<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.859> half<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.359> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.899> movie<00:02:01.229> so
