00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.540
 girls 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 first let's weigh all the kinders and 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.880
 I hope that at least in one of them to us 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.900

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.950

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 And now let's open up and find out what 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 for toys we will fall for 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.230
 the number of orange capsules is simple 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.300
 rolls over 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:31.990
 let's start first with the usual 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.220
 pretty colorful toy here we have 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.270
 let's try to run 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.720
 Well returns and God bless her 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:30.590
 and here we got this bracelet 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.590

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
 we get this bracelet 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.630
 It is designed for a child's hand I can 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.610
 put it on three fingers 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:58.070
 we get this kind of brass knuckles 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.240
 very very good and functional 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.270
 a toy more such would meet 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.820
 in general in the shadows and so will not be anymore 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:21.680

 Barbie Barbie on the beach is wonderful 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.500
 the toy looks great 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.770
 workmanship is also high 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.770
 level 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:50.600
 here we have a fight with a fabric skirt 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:58.340
 Now we will find out who she is 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:03.470
 who she wants to be here with us 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:08.330
 Barbie TV star she gets a statuette 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.760
 the oscar is pretty funny plot for 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.590
 toys 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.500
 that is, look at two toys and we already have 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:23.650
 the collection is replenished too 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:27.440

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.680
 quite large here compare with 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.490
 a capsule that is a figurine almost two 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.530
 times a capsule which fabric skirt 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.620
 still we have let's put it and 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:48.800
 I hope we continue judging by the weight 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:59.150
 it will be two more girls so and here at 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:00.860
 we lock it so we are like but oh yeah 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.840
 this is the main series also 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.840
 but only presented in the form of a lock 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.540
 so here is such a lock 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.040
 him 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.040
 let's try to check the mechanism 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:36.400
 closed and opened everything works 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:40.220
 It turns out such a plastic lock 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:45.440
 with the key thanks to this eyelet 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:48.380
 you can hang somewhere pretty good 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:55.400
 the toy also has these 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:06:01.370
 let's put the stickers and finally our 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:05.300
 The last egg is opened and here we have 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:12.220
 some other barbie will find out now 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:14.390
 what is it right here we have a repeat 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.080
 also TV star bombing 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.380

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.320
 surprised from six kinder in 4 contained 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.570
 main series two other toys too 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.640
 excellent quality that will go to 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.030
 collection is not ashamed to put on the shelf 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.580
 for me this is a very atypical result 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.930
 as you probably know me very often 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.690
 there are repetitions 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.000
 that is, if I buy 6 kinders in these 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:45.290
 six kinder necessarily 3 toys 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.110
 same here it happened and here 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.030
 good luck i will continue to open eggs
