00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and dead guys was still cma and condemned 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.670
 with the last video that I went up on this 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 video I will tell you the changes that you see in 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.719
 some exotic weapons with the patch 2.0 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.160
 of destiny and if not in the video that I went up 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.840
 changes in general all weapons 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 click on the image screen or the link 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 out in the description take into account 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.609
 that all the changes in the exotic 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.920
 come on top of the changes in general 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.570
 to your group of weapons for example in de 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.580
 the adjustments of the necro cases there is no 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 none that improves its damage but since 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.609
 all automatic rifles that are 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 increasing the damage this includes the black 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.910
 so I recommend you see that first 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.410
 video or the same can read directly 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.480
 the patch notes in the link to a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
 description so without giving more laps 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.780
 let's start with the exotic ones first 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.460
 affected are the harley with light 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 direct many people like the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.370
 design and shooting in this weapon but 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.410
 was affected when rifles came down 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 automatic with this patch is expected 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.309
 that is good again even better than 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 before your changes are to increase this 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.140
 basic skill to 80 before was in 65 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 increase the bounce the projectiles of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 direct light that is special skill and the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 direct projectiles will not be 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.070
 affected by the damage fall to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.989
 distances which is something that bonnie 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 He explained that reduces damage from over them 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.610
 like the enemy this will apply 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.510
 automatic rifles minus this one on top 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.010
 of this remember 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 that the increase in damage in all 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 automatic will also affect the direct 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 so I really want to try a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.480
 Once we follow out the expansion 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 the necro here are a difficult treasure 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.230
 to get but that does not measure up what 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 that represents or at least not before 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.220
 you stay with this standard weapon in day 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 which came out this will be the first time 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.270
 the adjustment and the changes look good from 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 first of increasing stability goes to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 be 60 before I was in 40 will increase 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.840
 the ammunition in its cartridge although not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 told how his ability to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.770
 special curse bringer will now be activated 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 on all the precision shots before 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.520
 had an 80% chance to activate and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.740
 finally the explosion is over the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 special will be bigger and will have damage 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.490
 increased a good dimension or that they have 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.180
 been testing and they are happy with 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.400
 the results 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 remember that on top of this we have the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.910
 increased damage in the automatic plan and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 the street of damage to distances so 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.110
 this will also affect the black going to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 the great hand-held the three exotic 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.979
 will receive an adjustment first with the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.240
 last word primary wake that is 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.729
 faster more in the game 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.410
 his intention is that this weapon does not lose 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.450
 that talent but that the players 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.220
 focus on using it without aiming 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.420
 changes will be reduction of the state of 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.580
 range to 10 before 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 was in 20 reductions stability to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.349
 20 before I was in 30 reduction of the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 range when aiming increase the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.950
 accuracy and the critical year when firing 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.690
 of the hip which is good and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 they will fix a book that had the weapon that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.900
 the critical shots I received in the bonus 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.520
 damage when they shot aiming which 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 only directive I know when they shoot 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.239
 of the hip I think the changes 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.860
 of the last word are fine but 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.540
 when you add the negative adjustments 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.430
 that will come in all the cannons 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.170
 brothers really it seems that this weapon 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.420
 ends up in the trash we have to see 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.480
 what's happening continuing now we have the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.950
 thorn this weapon or you love it or hate it if 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.420
 you do not have it bothers you that you always 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.280
 mate with it in crucible and yes yes the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.959
 you have sometimes it bothers you that you have to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.000
 use it to fight others 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 the use above the changes already 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.239
 will come in all the hand cannons with 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.489
 the damage fall and the reduction of 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.500
 accuracy when shooting fast this weapon 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.299
 you will only have two adjustments on the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.670
 special poison will be reduced until 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.650
 more or less a third is to say that if 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.959
 I used to do six damage in crucible 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 be poisoned then now he will make two of 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.549
 damage at the same time allow that if 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.859
 you hit several shots at the enemy you can 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.359
 accumulate damage up to five times they say 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.050
 that this is an improvement in the poison of 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.840
 weapon but 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.680
 will not increase its lethality in the crucible 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.690
 considering that the great ones of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.700
 hand will lose ammunition and accuracy to and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.410
 for quick I think these changes 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.820
 the hawthorn is good so that it stops 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.250
 be so good but not that in the 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.140
 fuck then with common garlic or the earl 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 moon one of the most desired weapons and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.920
 I wanted to be the game the changes in these 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.330
 were that the damage bonus they have 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.620
 certain bullets in this gun of life or 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.170
 special abilities can not be 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 accumulating more than two in a bullet for 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.130
 they do not know it there were very rare cases 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.930
 but if they passed with this hand cannon 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.820
 could kill with a shot when they had the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.220
 lucky that the bullet came out with both 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 damage bonuses according to this will no longer happen 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.180
 once this patch comes out 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.920
 will increase in two rods the cartridge 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.140
 hot moon once unlocked the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.910
 special and his ability to luck in the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.350
 bedroom will reduce the bonus damage 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.700
 between the percent 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.530
 this weapon will remain an excellent 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.810
 hand cannon but you can not kill with 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.910
 a shot of luck Xbox users 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.470
 You can get this weapon once you leave 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.940
 this expansion but I feel little bad 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.799
 that they will not be able to prove it in all their 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.720
 splendor as it is now following 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.820
 now with the specials we have the 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.109
 icebreaker sniper to this weapon 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.240
 exotic will change its effect of 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.470
 recharge now reload a bullet every 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.360
 eight seconds 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.220
 of every five personally I do not understand 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.660
 where did this change come from that I know 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.320
 for good never complained this is 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.050
 sniper 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.330
 one bullet every eight seconds is a big 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.130
 reduction if they wanted to lower it I think 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.320
 what to put in every six seconds was already 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.580
 enough but good we'll have to 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.590
 try it once the station leaves 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.780
 see what happens then we have the nanny the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.280
 million with a terra de plus ultra 'by 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.780
 how long they take as the worst weapon 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.670
 of the game this sniper every 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.920
 primary school that needed improvement from 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.870
 that came out the changes in this weapon will be 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.180
 increase the driving speed to 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.250
 aim to take out and move it faster 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.530
 adjust the sight glass to avoid certain 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.600
 problems that had point increase 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.220
 the effect of his skill the teacher to 8 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.230
 seconds which is something positive does 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.600
 that the effect of the mentioned year lasts longer and 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.130
 Add an additional 20% damage in 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.440
 precision shot when the skill 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.060
 of the teacher is active the idea with this 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.680
 weapon is not that it is useful for all 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.880
 cases is more than a weapon for 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.370
 those snipers who want and 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.780
 leave the pot ran then we have a 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.910
 change of the black hammer 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.740
 crota sniper's brother is 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.200
 exotic but with equal has put in this 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.080
 list the changes will be that this weapon 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.889
 now stores 18 bullets and when activated 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.900
 his ability to 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.849
 white or white male instead of appearing 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.400
 three bullets of grenades recharge three 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.020
 bullets automatically from your inventory 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.669
 I think that with this change they destroyed 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.129
 completely the special thing about this weapon 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.749
 but the truth does not bother me as well 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.009
 some boss battles are final 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:48.120
 they came back very easy if I used the 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.129
 ability of this weapon to have 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.509
 infinite ammunition although the same I think 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.669
 who screwed it up by putting it this way 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.039
 although we have the shotgun but the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.749
 exotic wolves of the last dlc this 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.819
 frame will receive a change over 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.620
 special the recovery effect in your 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.180
 allies when you kill enemies is going to 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.689
 treble many want to see how 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.969
 it will turn out this and finally the fuck the 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.229
 the most powerful weapon of the whole game the 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.210
 that everyone wants more than any other 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.529
 when they do not have it good, he mentioned that 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.270
 when they created this weapon their intention 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.129
 it was always powerful but not 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.930
 so much so to get to the point where 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.000
 certain equipment will require you to 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.800
 to be able to play with them the changes in 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.110
 farms were only about special 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.520
 wolfpack rounds or the mini rockets 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.319
 crawlers that appear after they 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.479
 explode the main bridge will have the 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.370
 Reduced damage when exactly not what 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.050
 said bonnie personally I think it's 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.610
 a very good change the weapon will continue 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.160
 being as is as it is now only that 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.110
 will be more level as 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.879
 if for example the rocket launcher the truth 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.590
 he did 5000 damage with his rocket 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.509
 principal and the desire for the same 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.210
 but then with its small rockets the 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.379
 face hong reaches more than 7,000 then 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.090
 I believe that the reduction in rockets 

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.470
 small will be so that the difference of 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.539
 damage is not so great with others 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.129
 rocket launcher although it will remain the 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.190
 most damaging weapon in the entire game 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.780
 well now guys let me know down on 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.669
 the comments that they think about these 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.009
 changes in the exotic ones I think that 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:06.509
 there are the odd ones as excellent advice 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.949
 and dragon breath that would have 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.199
 dropped an adjustment well and well 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.180
 simply do so again because 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.830
 he did not pay attention to them but 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.569
 well, these changes are pretty 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.860
 welcome this is true for this 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.330
 video guys I hope you liked it 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.250
 If there is any doubt as we always have 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.909
 the comments a greeting to all and not 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.909
 it feels video 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.810
 to
