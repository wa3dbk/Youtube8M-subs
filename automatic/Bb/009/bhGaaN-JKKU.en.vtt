ok so today I'm gonna be showing you how

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.940 
ok so today I'm gonna be showing you how
to<00:00:07.950> do<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.570> this<00:00:09.570> cut<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.900> called<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.440> 190

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to do that this cut is called the 190

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.120 
to do that this cut is called the 190
helix<00:00:11.309> cut<00:00:12.320> there<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.380> two<00:00:13.500> reasons<00:00:13.710> why<00:00:13.950> I'm

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
helix cut there are two reasons why I'm

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.550 
helix cut there are two reasons why I'm
showing<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.610> cut<00:00:14.849> one<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
showing you this cut one is because I

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320 
showing you this cut one is because I
think<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.039> very<00:00:17.250> good<00:00:17.400> beginner<00:00:17.910> flourish

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
think it's a very good beginner flourish

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
think it's a very good beginner flourish
i<00:00:18.779> still<00:00:19.650> even<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.070> sometimes<00:00:20.580> just<00:00:20.939> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
i still even use it sometimes just to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.720 
i still even use it sometimes just to
practice<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.550> it's<00:00:23.550> very<00:00:23.939> simple<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:25.730> yeah

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
practice and it's very simple but yeah

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.470 
practice and it's very simple but yeah
it's<00:00:27.029> very<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:27.990> beginners<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.480> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's very good for beginners so and the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.220 
it's very good for beginners so and the
second<00:00:30.810> reason<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:32.510> many<00:00:33.510> people<00:00:33.899> liked

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
second reason is not many people liked

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.850 
second reason is not many people liked
the<00:00:34.620> flourish<00:00:35.040> i<00:00:35.340> did<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:36.320> swinging<00:00:37.320> pivot<00:00:37.680> cut

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the flourish i did in swinging pivot cut

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.450 
the flourish i did in swinging pivot cut
part<00:00:38.129> 2<00:00:38.510> which<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.410> i<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.280> admit

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
part 2 which was that and i will admit

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.100 
part 2 which was that and i will admit
it's<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> better<00:00:42.480> flourishes<00:00:42.960> i

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's not one of the better flourishes i

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
it's not one of the better flourishes i
know<00:00:43.170> by<00:00:43.860> now<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.280> probably<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
know by now it's probably one of the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.170 
know by now it's probably one of the
worst<00:00:45.030> flourishes<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.730> think<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
worst flourishes i know i think it is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.610 
worst flourishes i know i think it is
the<00:00:48.390> worst<00:00:48.719> flourish<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
the worst flourish i know actually and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.700 
the worst flourish i know actually and
so<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.000> i<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.289> telling

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so to make up for that i will be telling

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
so to make up for that i will be telling
you<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> helix<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:59.870> by<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you the one on the helix okay by now you

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
you the one on the helix okay by now you
should<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.620> mastered<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> moves<00:01:03.449> I've
