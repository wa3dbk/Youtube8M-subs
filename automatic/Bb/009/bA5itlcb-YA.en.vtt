00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
think in kind of still feeling like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500 
think in kind of still feeling like
you're<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.829> with<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.099> trend<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.519> also<00:02:52.700> having

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you're in with the trend but also having

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.990 
you're in with the trend but also having
your<00:02:53.659> own<00:02:53.810> style<00:02:54.230> as<00:02:55.129> well<00:02:55.430> it's<00:02:55.790> really

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
your own style as well it's really

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.429 
your own style as well it's really
important<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.389> kind<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.629> make<00:02:56.810> your<00:02:56.959> own<00:02:57.109> mark

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
important to kind of make your own mark

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.030 
important to kind of make your own mark

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340

feel<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.099> Australian<00:03:22.639> designers<00:03:22.939> are

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
feel that Australian designers are

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
feel that Australian designers are
influenced<00:03:23.900> by<00:03:24.200> overseas<00:03:24.919> or<00:03:25.219> vice<00:03:25.400> versa<00:03:25.430> I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
influenced by overseas or vice versa I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.300 
influenced by overseas or vice versa I
think<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.219> obviously<00:03:29.379> Australia<00:03:30.379> does<00:03:31.010> look

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
think that obviously Australia does look

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.319 
think that obviously Australia does look
internationally<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:33.290> everything<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.159> know

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
internationally for everything you know

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.319 
internationally for everything you know
but<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.690> mean<00:03:36.590> obviously<00:03:36.739> all<00:03:37.669> designers<00:03:38.120> I

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
but I mean obviously all designers I

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.059 
but I mean obviously all designers I
guess<00:03:38.629> everyone's<00:03:39.049> influenced<00:03:39.500> by<00:03:39.620> everyone

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
guess everyone's influenced by everyone

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.379 
guess everyone's influenced by everyone
and<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.340> definitely<00:03:40.699> do<00:03:40.879> feel<00:03:40.909> like

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
and I definitely do feel like

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.809 
and I definitely do feel like
Australians<00:03:42.019> are<00:03:42.229> influenced<00:03:42.949> by<00:03:43.010> overseas

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
Australians are influenced by overseas

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.629 
Australians are influenced by overseas
but<00:03:44.030> then<00:03:44.209> also<00:03:44.419> they've<00:03:44.750> taken<00:03:45.139> it<00:03:45.440> and

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
but then also they've taken it and

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.250 
but then also they've taken it and
brought<00:03:46.639> in<00:03:46.909> their<00:03:47.120> own<00:03:47.269> unique<00:03:47.689> design<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:48.169> it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
brought in their own unique design of it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.780 
brought in their own unique design of it
like<00:03:48.439> I<00:03:48.560> think<00:03:48.799> Australian<00:03:49.250> designers<00:03:49.669> are

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
like I think Australian designers are

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.580 
like I think Australian designers are
very<00:03:49.819> unique<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.780> every<00:03:51.019> time<00:03:51.229> I<00:03:51.260> wear<00:03:51.500> an
