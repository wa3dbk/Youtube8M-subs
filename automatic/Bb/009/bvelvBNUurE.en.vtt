00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 so here I have a video record on the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.259
 fingering of fingering its 99% success of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.580
 montceau and that's the guarantee of your 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.820
 success at sila fingering and bad do not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.250
 succeeds so actually the fingering it's not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 it's not invented to poison you 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 life I'm talking to students because 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 that pianists and know very well 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 that the secret of a good fingering without 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.649
 military secret has one that has 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.660
 found a straight and more comfortable 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.840
 that others in a passage 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.300
 difficult it is true to succeed but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.629
 better than other days aa faster 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 that she will play with more flexibility 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.010
 they found a lot less time 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 because the fingering is our comfort 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 under bubble of fingering is to render 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 anyone a comfortable piece 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 comfortable and so you have to do 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.479
 really a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 I told my students that when you 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.180
 read a score to hurt the do's 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.520
 of the attempt to see the notes there after 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.770
 play with anyone so it must 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.159
 other with I do not know what then can 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.220
 to be with the neo with the elbow with with 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.600
 the buttocks with any finger and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.390
 so it will never work because the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 Logic and Antwerp 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.640
 what what finger is lolo 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.140
 the index playing notes 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.049
 it's the fifth one playing so much 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.369
 because the pianists confirmed that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.710
 bluntly when we look 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.210
 scores he looks he technical 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.009
 they will play what is it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.689
 are there as obstacles 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.200
 what determines the earth 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.320
 how are you doing with kiel fingering 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.829
 so the fingering is your only 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.240
 chance of succeeding the piece and that's the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.969
 first thing we do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320
 watch out for all pianists confirmed 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.840
 when she starts working the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.660
 piece what does he do he takes a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.179
 pencil and he places his own fingering 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.269
 past 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.980
 in the newsrooms for for 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.079
 adults actually for pianists 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.599
 confirmed will be there is nothing or there is 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:23.709
 two three measures only to sometimes 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:26.950
 horrible fingering it happens to me like 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.599
 to take the scores to where they are 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.939
 ask why I can not 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.950
 to play such a passage I work for 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.840
 hours and it does not work and I 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.510
 watch the right-hand man understands that with this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.389
 fingering it will never work because 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.450
 it's playable so with move she has to 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:46.090
 understand an easy thing in doubles and 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.959
 with intelligent fingering and 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.060
 strategic 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.879
 we can resume a very 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.790
 difficult very very accessible and 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.540
 affordable and so that's it 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.760
 number 1 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.430
 and if you are lucky enough to have a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.650
 teacher who takes his time to you 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.530
 place the fingering and this fingering 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.900
 comfortable after fault the idea why 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.030
 because you know that the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 asian chinese japanese so 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.940
 in fact that nothing he calls the wrist 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.530
 themselves the outer brain so the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.269
 tribe oao handle e mail the ability to 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.250
 think alone anyway it's 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.590
 true because we then have you 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.329
 all have small daily actions 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.069
 who makes you without thinking 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.129
 for example when you clean the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.510
 teeth do you think more is that it's 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.699
 vertical is it horizontal and 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.069
 how to hold the bush for 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.019
 that it will be perpendicular to the teeth 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.669
 you clean your teeth and you 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.530
 think what are you going to buy 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.989
 this afternoon what are you 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.870
 go tell on the phone and you make a 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.359
 full full of little things that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.939
 to think already enough absolutely everything 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.060
 to master and as I read piano this is the 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.400
 but that's it it's automated everything 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.599
 is the pianists actually the students 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.189
 advanced at the end of what you say 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.430
 that after twenty years taking 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.739
 pieces that we played 20 years ago and we 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.590
 give no first note 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.000
 we arrive until the last 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.010
 that's busy was in the head we get 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.190
 recalls behind but that's the fingers and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.720
 walk the path from raw to 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.490
 the last note with all the traits 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.950
 China teams ndour with all the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.970
 details with everything is automated coach 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.340
 the robots and so for that for your 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.300
 stupidity and there is only one way was 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.290
 repeated thousands of voices to the good 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.010
 gestures 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.380
 the correct gesture not always the gestures 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.360
 different the different ways because 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.240
 it is instead of shouting neurons 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.660
 in the brain in the dance is a 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.330
 sun gesture you will scream 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.600
 many and it's going to be completely 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.850
 quantum whose coffee fingering must 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.860
 always be himself in the same 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.780
 in law 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.980
 and then we'll see what's needed 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.140
 to master others 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.140
 but above all the fingering
