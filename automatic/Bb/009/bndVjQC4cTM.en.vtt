first one on the right is the one from
qual<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.820> think<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.420> was<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:22.439> was<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:23.449> bridge

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
qual I think it was that was in bridge

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.349 
qual I think it was that was in bridge
of<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> droid<00:00:25.199> ship<00:00:25.550> that<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:27.060> ordering

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of the droid ship that was like ordering

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.250 
of the droid ship that was like ordering
him<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> destroy<00:00:27.750> Aayla<00:00:28.080> Secura<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:30.260> Jedi

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
him to destroy Aayla Secura is Jedi

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
him to destroy Aayla Secura is Jedi
cruiser<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.809> then<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> next<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.700> one

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
cruiser and then the next one is the one

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.619 
cruiser and then the next one is the one
from<00:00:36.920> Malastare<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.000> had<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.329> go

and he got destroyed but I thought he

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
and he got destroyed but I thought he
