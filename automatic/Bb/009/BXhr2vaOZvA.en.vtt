00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
ready to get back out there obviously

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
ready to get back out there obviously
but<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.550> what's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but you know you just got to do what's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
but you know you just got to do what's
best<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.150> though<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.869> new<00:01:21.990> Celtics

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
best for him though and the new Celtics

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.440 
best for him though and the new Celtics
have<00:01:22.710> noticed<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.220> change<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.910> pace<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
have noticed a change in the pace of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
have noticed a change in the pace of
practice<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.200> he<00:01:26.190> makes<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> difference

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
practice as well he makes a difference

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.540 
practice as well he makes a difference
and<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.800> say<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.009> would<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> case

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
and I would say that would be the case

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.029 
and I would say that would be the case
with<00:01:29.910> any<00:01:30.180> accomplished<00:01:30.930> older<00:01:31.320> player<00:01:31.619> you

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
with any accomplished older player you

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.670 
with any accomplished older player you
know<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.550> they<00:01:33.080> understand<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.320> but

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
know just because they understand it but

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
know just because they understand it but
he<00:01:34.860> certainly<00:01:35.130> has<00:01:35.460> made<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> difference<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
he certainly has made a difference in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
he certainly has made a difference in
the<00:01:36.390> drills<00:01:36.690> he's<00:01:37.259> very<00:01:37.380> demanding<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the drills he's very demanding so the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
the drills he's very demanding so the
level<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.630> intensity<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.410> practice<00:01:40.770> really

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
level of intensity in practice really

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.389 
level of intensity in practice really
picks<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.990> also<00:01:42.990> competing<00:01:43.320> against<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
picks up also competing against them it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.460 
picks up also competing against them it
makes<00:01:44.580> me<00:01:44.789> better<00:01:45.030> makes<00:01:45.899> Jordan<00:01:46.259> better

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
makes me better makes Jordan better

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.050 
makes me better makes Jordan better
makes<00:01:46.740> everybody<00:01:47.130> better<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.640> years<00:01:47.820> he's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
makes everybody better for years he's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
makes everybody better for years he's
been<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> best<00:01:48.690> around<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.619> can

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
been one of the best around and you can
