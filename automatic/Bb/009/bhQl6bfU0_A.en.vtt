 our mousse for this lemon mousse 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.700
 We are going to need 500 milliliters of cream 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.700

 little condensed milk 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.499

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.380
 well once we've put 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.260
 our mus in the mold 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.540
 let's set at least three or 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.569
 four hours in the fridge but if you can 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.559
 be from one day to another better 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:45.990
 well while our cake curd I'm going to 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.680
 let's do one of the things for 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.770
 decorate it 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.060
 let's put more or less half a glass 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.060
 of these little water 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.570
 and we are going to put you 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.570
 i 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.820
 three good spoonfuls of sugar 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.990
 and we are going to leave 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:15.410
 and let it go like a syrup 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.510
 As you can see I have here the lemon skin 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.560
 that I have taken out and we are going to do 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.560
 a little strip 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.730
 good the lemon dates we're going to go 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.960
 throwing in the water with the sugar and the 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.040
 Once our syrup is made 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.449
 the lemon strip will be baked 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.360
 and will stay with him as 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.949
 and it will be very rich 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 let's let it be done as you see already 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.189
 you see our lemon slices 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.469
 transparent and the syrup is clear 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:57.069
 so what we're going to do now is with 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:06:00.490
 very careful and taking it out I have here a 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.069
 dish with sugar and let's go 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.550
 throwing with great care here in the 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.550
 sugar 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.789
 is syrup if you want you can 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.930
 use to get some biscuits 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.470
 or whatever you want 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.789
 Now what we are going to do is symbolize 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.789
 those in sugar 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.370
 We have here a dish prepared with a 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.370
 little paper 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.780
 where will we put it 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.900
 and here we have it already finished for 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.820
 After decorating our cake we're going to 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.820

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.969

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.610

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:06.750
 I decorated it with a little cream 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.730
 mounted with yellow coloring 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.440

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.980
