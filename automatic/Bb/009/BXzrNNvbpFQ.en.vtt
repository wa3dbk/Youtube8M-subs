00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello girls then today we 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.940
 let's see the difference between a 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 diet and good habits 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 food 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 so I think that today more and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.789
 more people in any case from that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.170
 I see on the blocks understand that he 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.010
 better to talk about good habits 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.699
 food 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.039
 rather than diet but in fact what 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.689
 is the difference between a diet and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.149
 to take good eating habits 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.960
 gold first let's see together the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.210
 definition of the word regime the regime is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.350
 any temporary drastic restriction 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 at the food or caloric level at 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.590
 diet is something very 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.789
 difficult that we will not be able to hold 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.920
 on the long term 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.570
 so it's doomed to failure 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.399
 simply because it's really too much 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.350
 difficult and so we will end up 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.930
 crack and return to our old 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 eating habits then need 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.219
 know that in diets often we have 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.650
 more loss of high muscular level 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.700
 than at the level of greece and it's not 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.229
 what you want because you are going 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
 end up burning fewer calories and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.189
 find yourself anyway with a 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.320
 Greece's surplus as the rate of 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 diet calories is too low it's okay 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 lead to starvation and therefore your body 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.790
 will start a mechanism of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.920
 defense and this will make it impossible to 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.430
 So lose the excess fat 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.960
 again we find ourselves in a failure 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.619
 the common defense system en route 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.799
 the body is called the anti response 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.340
 family it is a defense system that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.280
 the body has to protect itself in case of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.179
 starvation drought malnutrition 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.399
 to just stay alive so the 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.759
 body will decrease its caloric demand 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.560
 may slow down his metabolism and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.360
 thus conserve energy 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.369
 so it's a bit like you 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.850
 put your boiler to the minimum level 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.679
 and to just keep the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 minimum heat you need 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.340
 well that's what's happening in your 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770
 body also the body does not do the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.649
 difference between a regime or a state of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 famine and that's why the loss of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.950
 weight will start to decrease until 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.319
 stop 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 gold obviously at the beginning when you do 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.140
 a diet 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.690
 you are going to have a weight loss 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.879
 fast then it'll slow down 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.049
 and then it'll stop instead of 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.260
 think diet 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.819
 we should think habit take from 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.370
 good eating habits 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.739
 so if you put on weight it's 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.180
 that what you eat is too little 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.700
 high caloric level compared to this 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 that your body needs so what it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.650
 it is necessary to rebalance progressively 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.440
 your nutrition to take good 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 long-term eating habits 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.829
 so there's no point in doing a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.660
 diet and once you have reached 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.180
 the point of you want to go back to 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.650
 your nutrition from before because if it has you 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.269
 made against wood once 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.819
 there is no reason for you not to 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.930
 repeat not point to new course 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.239
 by taking good habits 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.799
 food and adding exercise 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.560
 physical you will get results 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.489
 in the long run then exercise 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.910
 physical it does not mean 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.220
 especially the others take 1 ap 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.870
 in the gym and go there every 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.360
 days for two hours it can be 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.310
 simple things you all do 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.630
 the days on the stairs rather than 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.250
 the escalators market a little bit more 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.080
 there are also exercises all 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.450
 simple that you can do at home 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.070
 I also posted on my blog a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.080
 little exercise chart that you can 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.450
 do it every day at home that you 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.490
 takes 25 minutes it already gives very 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.810
 good results 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.210
 I hope you understand now 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 why I rarely speak in terms of 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.580
 diet but well in terms of habits 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.050
 food or rebalancing 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.700
 nutritional if you have any 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.760
 questions you can leave them here 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.230
 below in comment and I will be 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.120
 a pleasure to answer them 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.500
 if you know people who 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.780
 are origin and who do not have 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.880
