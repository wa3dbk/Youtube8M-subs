hi<00:00:06.230> in<00:00:06.950> this<00:00:07.010> video<00:00:07.580> I<00:00:07.670> am<00:00:07.760> going<00:00:08.000> to<00:00:08.090> discuss

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
hi in this video I am going to discuss

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.510 
hi in this video I am going to discuss
about<00:00:08.660> alternation<00:00:09.590> of<00:00:09.650> generation<00:00:10.190> in<00:00:10.340> and

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
about alternation of generation in and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:19.090 
about alternation of generation in and
use<00:00:11.090> permit<00:00:11.450> plants<00:00:16.330> in<00:00:17.330> plants<00:00:17.930> the<00:00:18.710> haploid

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
use permit plants in plants the haploid

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.190 
use permit plants in plants the haploid
and<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.550> diploid<00:00:19.910> cells<00:00:20.330> have<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:21.170> ability

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
and the diploid cells have the ability

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.260 
and the diploid cells have the ability
to<00:00:21.770> divide<00:00:22.010> by<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.310> process<00:00:22.850> of<00:00:22.970> mitosis<00:00:25.270> the

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
to divide by the process of mitosis the

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:38.740 
to divide by the process of mitosis the
haploid<00:00:30.130> or<00:00:31.899> the<00:00:32.899> diploid<00:00:35.890> cells<00:00:37.540> have<00:00:38.540> the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
haploid or the diploid cells have the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.229 
haploid or the diploid cells have the
ability<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.560> divide<00:00:40.280> by<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.579> process<00:00:41.090> of

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
ability to divide by the process of

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:49.060 
ability to divide by the process of
mitosis<00:00:44.710> this<00:00:45.710> ability<00:00:46.810> of<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:48.410> haploid<00:00:48.770> and

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
mitosis this ability of the haploid and

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.560 
mitosis this ability of the haploid and
the<00:00:49.190> diploid<00:00:49.489> cells<00:00:49.880> to<00:00:50.030> divide<00:00:50.300> by<00:00:50.510> the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
the diploid cells to divide by the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.840 
the diploid cells to divide by the
process<00:00:51.020> of<00:00:51.140> mitosis<00:00:51.430> leads<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.700> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
process of mitosis leads to the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.840 
process of mitosis leads to the
formation<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:54.280> haploid<00:00:57.130> or<00:00:59.860> diploid<00:01:00.860> plant

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
formation of haploid or diploid plant

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.240 
formation of haploid or diploid plant
bodies

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.850 

so<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:11.640> enables<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:13.510> form<00:01:13.810> haploid<00:01:14.590> or

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
so this enables to form haploid or

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.900 
so this enables to form haploid or
diploid<00:01:15.310> plant<00:01:16.270> body<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.520> haploid

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
diploid plant body then the haploid

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.840 
diploid plant body then the haploid
plant<00:01:19.360> body<00:01:20.550> these<00:01:21.550> haploid<00:01:22.300> plant<00:01:22.780> body

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
plant body these haploid plant body

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.160 
plant body these haploid plant body
produces<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:27.270> by<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.330> process<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.990> mitosis

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
produces what by the process of mitosis

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.130 
produces what by the process of mitosis
again<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.920> hypoid<00:01:33.430> plant<00:01:33.850> body<00:01:34.140> produces

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
again this hypoid plant body produces

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.410 
again this hypoid plant body produces
gametes<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:41.619> haploid<00:01:42.040> plant<00:01:42.580> bodies<00:01:42.970> by

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
gametes these haploid plant bodies by

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.390 
gametes these haploid plant bodies by
the<00:01:43.479> process<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.080> mitosis<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:44.830> produces

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
the process of mitosis it produces

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.180 
the process of mitosis it produces
gametes<00:01:46.090> hence<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.140> kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.560> plant<00:01:47.800> body<00:01:48.010> is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
gametes hence this kind of plant body is

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:58.170 
gametes hence this kind of plant body is
called<00:01:48.460> as<00:01:48.640> giametta<00:01:49.540> v<00:01:56.490> gametophyte<00:01:57.490> because

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
called as giametta v gametophyte because

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.260 
called as giametta v gametophyte because
it<00:01:58.750> produces<00:01:59.170> gametes<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.850> kind<00:02:01.119> of

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it produces gametes so this kind of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.850 
it produces gametes so this kind of
plant<00:02:01.570> body<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.900> called<00:02:02.170> as<00:02:02.350> gametophyte

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
plant body is called as gametophyte

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.420 
plant body is called as gametophyte
which<00:02:03.100> produces<00:02:03.880> gametes<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.430> produces

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
which produces gametes and produces

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.300 
which produces gametes and produces
gametes<00:02:06.729> by<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.030> process<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.570> mitosis<00:02:09.780> then

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
gametes by the process of mitosis then

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.390 
gametes by the process of mitosis then
after<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.790> process<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.360> fertilization

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
after the process of fertilization

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.820 
after the process of fertilization
suppose<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.350> process<00:02:17.739> of

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
suppose here the process of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:28.800 
suppose here the process of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
fertilization the zygote is formed this

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.259 
fertilization the zygote is formed this
shy<00:02:29.110> goat<00:02:29.380> undergo<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.459> process<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:31.060> mitosis

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
shy goat undergo the process of mitosis

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.440 
shy goat undergo the process of mitosis
and<00:02:31.870> form<00:02:33.209> diploid<00:02:34.410> sporophyte<00:02:35.410> egg<00:02:36.450> plant

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and form diploid sporophyte egg plant

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
and form diploid sporophyte egg plant
body

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.350

long expose these haploid spores are

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.619 
long expose these haploid spores are
produced<00:03:23.280> by<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> process<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.900> meiosis<00:03:29.629> the

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
produced by the process of meiosis the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.690 
produced by the process of meiosis the

diploid sporophytic plant body produces

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.240 
diploid sporophytic plant body produces
haploid<00:03:32.940> spores<00:03:33.269> by<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> process<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.440> meiosis

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
haploid spores by the process of meiosis

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.330 
haploid spores by the process of meiosis
then<00:03:36.120> these<00:03:36.420> haploid<00:03:36.870> spores<00:03:37.200> again<00:03:37.980> undergo

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
then these haploid spores again undergo

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.949 
then these haploid spores again undergo
the<00:03:38.700> process<00:03:38.879> of<00:03:39.269> meiosis<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.760> they<00:03:41.760> form

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.770 

undergo<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.139> process<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.680> mitosis<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.780> they

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
undergo the process of mitosis and they

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.030 
undergo the process of mitosis and they
perform<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.650> haploid<00:03:50.129> plant<00:03:50.760> body<00:03:51.109> so<00:03:52.109> here<00:03:52.859> we

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
perform a haploid plant body so here we

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.650 
perform a haploid plant body so here we
can<00:03:53.190> see<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.870> whole<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.709> process<00:03:56.190> is

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
can see that the whole the process is

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.390 
can see that the whole the process is
starting<00:03:57.660> from<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.199> one<00:03:58.410> point<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.010> ending

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
starting from the one point and ending

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.490 
starting from the one point and ending
at<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.579> same<00:03:59.910> point<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.750> here<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.260> say

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
at the same point so here we can say

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.430 
at the same point so here we can say
that<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.010> there<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:03.030> an<00:04:03.209> alternation<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:04.199> the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that that there is an alternation in the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.569 
that that there is an alternation in the
generation<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.099> the<00:04:05.340> plant<00:04:09.379> in<00:04:10.379> most<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.430> the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
generation of the plant in most of the

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.360 
generation of the plant in most of the
plants<00:04:12.030> which<00:04:12.269> are<00:04:12.449> sexually<00:04:12.959> reproducing<00:04:13.650> we

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
plants which are sexually reproducing we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.759 
plants which are sexually reproducing we
can<00:04:14.579> see<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.269> there<00:04:15.569> is<00:04:15.599> an<00:04:15.930> alternation<00:04:16.530> of

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
can see that there is an alternation of

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:27.670 
can see that there is an alternation of
