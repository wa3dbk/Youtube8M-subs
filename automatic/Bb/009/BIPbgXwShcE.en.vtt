00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.300

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.140

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.480
 this is kiko and i'm there 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.310
 finding it very well lately I stretch it 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.500
 underground mobile eyelid on that 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.260
 fixed then I take another base this is 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.900
 that of the next and is opaque white and la 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.850
 use to make the colors stand out more 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.860
 I also lay down the lower lashes 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.350
 then I take one of my pigments 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.480
 favorite of the mac vanilla and lo 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.130
 I lay with this beautiful broad brush 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.200
 all over the mobile eyelid a little 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 on the inside corner and then under the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.630
 eyebrow like dominant your take 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.869
 this villa eye shadow very very much 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.110
 clear delicate and stretch it all along 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.479
 the mobile eyelid then I take this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.060
 glittery morning and purple 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.280
 this is very pigmented very soft 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 i love this pencil and stand or like a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.520
 eyeliner along the upper lashes then 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.680
 I take this other eye shadow similar to 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.410
 but the first one is a little bit 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 darker as a shade and I roll it out 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.680
 on my fold and in the outer corner 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 then I take this other pigment 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.750
 pressed is a darker color than 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.580
 all the others also this a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 many letters and I spread it out to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.370
 center of the fold and then I go to fade 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.370
 all smoke on a purpose 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.440
 then he picks up the pencil and I spread it out 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.560
 along all the lower eyelashes store 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.160
 try to get down too minted year 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.160
 with color 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.069
 then with this eyeliner brush I go 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.459
 to fade the pencil slowly and then if 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.230
 not the pencil even in the internal rhyme 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.670
 diego eyelashes 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.440
 looks like you're hurting me with 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.440
 this tool but it is not so quiet 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.170
 then mascara sosa this of maybelline 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.940
 lately and I'm enjoying it a lot 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.750
 but I had already talked about it then 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.420
 surely you know it lying along 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.989
 upper lashes and then he even those 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.989
 lower 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.160
 now blush this out of the kiko that it is 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.290
 a bottom leaves a very particular one 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.780
 time he spent seems very strong but in 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.120
 reality if I go to blend it turns out a lot 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.620
 very natural and cool to wear e 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.860
 then for the lips 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.860
 I spread this translucent pink gloss 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.640
 evola this is all girls emotion 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.400
 huge as usual and great 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.830
 next then also second thing up 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.930
 this is really super impeded and 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.770
 apply the nail polish and I'm not talking 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.940
 of the mail out or well also that in the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.010
 because I don't have a hand anymore 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.010
 always very firm though
