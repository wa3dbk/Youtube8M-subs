00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
 more than a countdown to the world 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.559
 A lot of experience of selection in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.519
 of great and small there are 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.129
 nervousness not 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.740
 no nervousness not a little bit of anxiety 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.199
 having that tingling goes well in the tummy 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.660
 like when you 're going to debut in a 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.939
 first division in the selection not by 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.329
 a player is to live is just the cutest 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.540
 what is there 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:30.969
 we are on a similar occasion to 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.370
 famous goal that they speak to you throughout your 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:36.789
 life because there are goals that you have left 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.289
 marked and I think it was marked 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.940
 I think that as soon as they say it, it comes to me 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.600
 the image in the head good even if 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.520
 with the proven hand I leave you had juanpe 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.829
 makes me change head on I the first 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.780
 His intention was to prepare the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.310
 chest to guide me to hit him 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.010
 then if we use - I had where I was 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.570
 the bow but in the air when I came 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.700
 I'm leaving a little past the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.700
 it squeezes and slows down and when I stay 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.950
 but nothing anymore when the impact and do 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.870
 the parable and that goes down the hour that 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.510
 was going to was going was something 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.430
 wonderful 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.520
 what a goal of yours chooses the best goal 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.380
 of a World Cup is the joy 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 when they told me I could not believe it 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 because after all that happened the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.460
 world one goal when it was 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.690
 eliminated to the truth that the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.640
 shutter and do not want to know anything more 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.340
 comes for the rosary I stayed here the 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.580
 he was very very hurt he was very sad 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.320
 they told me and now I did not give much 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 importance to the best later with the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.430
 run of the time I was giving account of 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.490
 what he had meant out there with in 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.040
 that moment but what work choose the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.960
 best goal of the world 1 when it gets to 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.630
 see what a global is what it is to do 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.400
 goals in a world cup I think that's going to 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.350
 be recorded to me forever because 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.320
 not always the trajectory is going to 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 have saved as many say this 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.310
 last world but we will not talk 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.290
 of the last we have many useful over 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 let's not let it be the last one let's 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.470
 remember all the others 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.690
 but this is also the way one is 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.220
 has a certain age that for worldwide 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 that are every few years out there not what 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.520
 I see that way to be in others but 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.250
 good the truth that you have to enjoy it 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.620
 but that it's not easy to be in a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.210
 global and good and this one I hope god wants 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.580
 can be the third then I'm going to 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.340
 Enjoy as if it were the first 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.560
 and as a child and devoted and touched to be 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630
 sparring of the Argentine team that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.270
 is to be sparring was a dream and to be 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.640
 there on the premises and when I had to go what 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.270
 players you had to get to the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.710
 dispute 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.960
 I think I got squirrel's crespo 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.990
 nose and a little bit with a tap 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.570
 He was also and is hearing and was 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:03.150
 drugged that but the sand when it touched me 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.970
 I'm going to say hello, he's welcome. 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.150
 it stands out because it deserves it was the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.680
 words that gave me welcome and nothing 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.510
 now that it was a nervousness to be there 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.210
 because I was in my house looking through 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.180
 television and the next day I was 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.310
 entering with them and how is it when you 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.380
 gives an indication marcelo bielsa 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.200
 and more being sparring 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.629
 it's complicated 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.239
 Frei been three times do not need well 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.250
 things got up a little the nothing 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.260
 many future 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.560
 when we played with him we did not do 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 all the clear court bailed side 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.260
 agreed clear with ribbons and gives you girl 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.440
 a bow or the rhythm that we put in 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.849
 agreement that was impressive but I 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.849
 agreement in a moment I want to take the 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.299
 ball to the corner he washed he bounced to 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.640
 walter samuel how good he looked for a corner 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.769
 breathe a little bit goes to the corner 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.930
 I turned around a long time ago 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.580
 training I will look for the ball 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.430
 everything I see that a ball comes out 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.099
 right away it 's on a backlash that 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.930
 military peak and I stayed like that 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.579
 running out to the other side what 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.160
 what happened I do not know I do not understand 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.930
 rules does not pass the crown and there was no 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.359
 with the lateral area just me a ball 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.000
 outside another one came into play and always 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.690
 for starters in the World 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.610
 germany against holland maybe it was sung 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.220
 for the first time the anthem or not decanted 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.470
 separate myself in a different way 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.620
 that feeling like lynching 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.390
 in a world that swells in Argentina 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.370
 moment 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.550
 It brings out everything that is inside, I think 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.610
 you are in a world cup and when the part 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.479
 of the hymn to me 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.360
 they bathe a lot of things there thinking 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.729
 first in your family that is or in the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.870
 court because it 's on the other side of 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.090
 puddle where I am where it is but 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.120
 When they start singing, they love you 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.490
 leave is going to play the game you want to 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.449
 live the adrenaline that is generating one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.999
 it's awesome I think 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.710
 you are representing a country is a 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.389
 world's entire outstanding world 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.309
 what you're doing then what 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.080
 we want inside the game field 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:20.539
 give an athletic to the people there no no 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.509
 there are millionaire contracts 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.169
 there is nothing winning the alpha shirt by 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.809
 T-shirt 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.599
 juas for the glory that I think the most 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.129
 cute that there are can be put millions 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.960
 of dollars and return the shirt the 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.779
 selection and the first thing you'll see from 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.779
 the shirt of the selection as for 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.949
 colleagues say contracts and plays 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.900
 a little in quotes for the money 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.120
 when you go to play Europe but you should not 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.979
 doing a job is your profession in what 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.529
 that you like I think that for me the best 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.789
 work that I have is this because I 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.319
 like my passion he wanted me with a ball 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.270
 pilot and I live it that way then 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.370
 for me that is something inexplicable 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.249
 so when I put on the shirt of the 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.680
 selection is the cutest thing there 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.419
 and you at that moment of sub-20 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.129
 there is a maximum you were champion of 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.439
 world more than that could not be done and 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.509
 having the plus of playing in your country with 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.009
 with your people nearby I do not mean 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.120
 only to the fans but to your 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.370
 family 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.680
 we went out champions we did not talk to the 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.900
 guys is already the most we could 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.180
 aspire we got it and they did not even have 20 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.669
 years and the truth that 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.039
 it was something impressive awesome 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.190
 because we said until we get what we 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.759
 more we can ask then they are good 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.139
 very nice things that tomorrow will not 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.639
 are going to be there today that we 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:40.530
 we keep meeting with the guys and 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.100
 we remember that moment we remember it 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.870
 why 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:51.150
 when the referee blows the end if I am 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.150
 the best is the best at that time
