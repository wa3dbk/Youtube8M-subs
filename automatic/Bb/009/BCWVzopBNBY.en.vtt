00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.900 

okay<00:00:06.830> I've<00:00:07.830> already<00:00:08.570> placed<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.750> center<00:00:10.200> in

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
okay I've already placed the center in

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.519 
okay I've already placed the center in
in<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.300> part<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.259> I'm<00:00:13.889> now<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.580> use<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
in the part and I'm now going to use a

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:23.200 
in the part and I'm now going to use a
quarter<00:00:16.529> inch<00:00:18.109> journal<00:00:19.699> to

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.330 

drill<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.080> hole

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:37.170 

it's<00:00:28.880> quite<00:00:29.210> hard<00:00:29.539> it's<00:00:30.320> quite<00:00:30.619> tough<00:00:31.220> I<00:00:32.980> find

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.920 

will<00:00:38.180> give<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.629> little<00:00:38.809> bit<00:00:39.079> of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.349 

see<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.650> toast<00:00:45.220> now

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
see I toast now

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.650 
see I toast now
that's<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:47.140> bit<00:00:47.350> better<00:00:47.620> so

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.840 

it<00:00:51.200> means<00:00:51.560> quite<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.980> bit<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:53.050> pressure<00:00:54.050> on<00:00:54.290> the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
it means quite a bit of pressure on the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.110 
it means quite a bit of pressure on the
rack

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:08.770 

and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.360> think<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:02.190> needs<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.820> lubricant

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.600 

but<00:01:09.320> as<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.590> can<00:01:09.770> see<00:01:10.100> it's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but as you can see it's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.460 
but as you can see it's
it's<00:01:11.970> not<00:01:12.720> exactly<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.530> sander<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> drill<00:01:15.930> bit

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
it's not exactly on sander the drill bit

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's not exactly on sander the drill bit
but<00:01:19.260> yes<00:01:20.260> seems<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:22.360> gets<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.780> bit<00:01:22.960> rough

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.850 

I<00:01:27.440> want<00:01:27.980> to<00:01:28.070> get<00:01:28.190> anything<00:01:28.400> on<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.760> camera

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
I want to get anything on the camera

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.260 
I want to get anything on the camera
okay<00:01:31.790> we'll<00:01:32.090> see

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
okay we'll see

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
okay we'll see
it<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.409> trilling

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.969 

it's<00:01:39.330> not<00:01:39.570> doing<00:01:39.870> a<00:01:39.960> bad<00:01:40.140> job

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
it's not doing a bad job

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.130 
it's not doing a bad job
that's<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.640> quarter<00:01:42.939> drill<00:01:43.299> going<00:01:43.659> through

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
that's a quarter drill going through

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's a quarter drill going through
without<00:01:45.130> any<00:01:45.189> lead

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
without any lead

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.929 
without any lead
or<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.000> smaller<00:01:48.359> drill<00:01:48.719> first<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> that's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
or a smaller drill first so that's

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.800 
or a smaller drill first so that's
quarter

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
quarter

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.620 
quarter
and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.800 
and
seems<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.410> me<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.980> gonna<00:01:56.160> be<00:01:56.810> pretty

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
seems to me that it's gonna be pretty

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.050 
seems to me that it's gonna be pretty
good

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
good

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.130 
good
when<00:01:59.630> it's<00:01:59.810> all<00:01:59.960> done

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.770 

yeah<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.950> probably<00:02:06.280> needs<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.880> bit<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.360> longer

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
yeah it probably needs a bit of a longer

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.130 
yeah it probably needs a bit of a longer
lever<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.940> disc<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:14.020> I'll

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
lever on the on the the disc so I'll

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.660 
lever on the on the the disc so I'll
probably<00:02:14.320> make<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.980> new<00:02:15.130> handle<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:17.140> three

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
probably make up a new handle with three

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
probably make up a new handle with three
bars<00:02:19.260> equally<00:02:20.260> spiced<00:02:21.540> running<00:02:22.540> pretty<00:02:22.780> dry

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
bars equally spiced running pretty dry

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.130 
bars equally spiced running pretty dry
out<00:02:23.790> don't<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.910> why<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> should<00:02:25.300> they<00:02:25.810> maybe

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
out don't know why I should they maybe

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.589 
out don't know why I should they maybe
it's<00:02:26.440> an<00:02:26.560> old<00:02:26.740> drill<00:02:27.100> bit

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.030 

it's<00:02:32.109> certainly<00:02:32.499> not<00:02:33.120> ground<00:02:34.120> properly<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it's certainly not ground properly and I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.970 
it's certainly not ground properly and I
just<00:02:36.280> got<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.579> out<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.939> an<00:02:37.060> old<00:02:37.180> box<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.980> drill

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
just got this out of an old box of drill

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.699 
just got this out of an old box of drill
bits<00:02:39.219> that<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.549> picked<00:02:39.849> up<00:02:40.060> through<00:02:40.469> many<00:02:41.469> many

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
bits that I picked up through many many

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.170 
bits that I picked up through many many
years<00:02:42.069> ago<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.269> I've<00:02:43.420> never<00:02:43.659> used<00:02:43.900> them

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
years ago and I've never used them

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:54.670 
years ago and I've never used them
so<00:02:48.019> anyway<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:53.250> doesn't<00:02:53.670> look<00:02:53.760> too<00:02:53.819> bad<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
so anyway that doesn't look too bad I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.780 
so anyway that doesn't look too bad I
think<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.799> all<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.129> be<00:02:56.189> pretty<00:02:56.549> good

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
think it's all going to be pretty good

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.569 
think it's all going to be pretty good
when<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.150> finished
