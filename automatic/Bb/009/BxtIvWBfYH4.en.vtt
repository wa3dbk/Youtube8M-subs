 your statement to the game please good 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.199
 Eve 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.350
 of course I'm not satisfied that 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.400
 we lost here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 I mean we have our thing very much 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.210
 Well made the first half off 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.340
 We also had attack under attack 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.340
 I mean we have of course misses 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.909
 and a few technical mistakes but that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 was not so much that I end so much 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.320
 had to defend at half time 1 I think 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.550
 I've been playing a lot with myself 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 good defense played 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.250
 our problem was a second one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 half time must be played and where we 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:52.290
 have you had huge problems with the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:55.040
 ks' victim also has all of you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.230
 the two minutes the legal proceedings 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 hit and then again two minutes 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.490
 and there we have it I think that was 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.450
 an 18 is not a good number because there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.310
 Do we think I have shares 18 or 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.319
 until 24 18 something like that was quite whole 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.120
 played bad and katja as always 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.330
 that punishes very hard with this 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.750
 collisions and with the second third 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.730
 wave 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.200
 they did that very well it is 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.330
 not easy to play here but me 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.819
 Others have presented me differently 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.110
 today 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.620
 Congratulations on the two points 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.640
 you have to earn alfred thw kiel 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.730
 say thank you mister when is one 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.730
 Stent fit enough 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.819
 So of course I'm very happy 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 that we won 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.510
 that would have increased significantly too 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.910
 one can compare to the last game 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.950
 of course I say I have a lot 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.630
 upset 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.660
 at half past time 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.610
 because I thought we played well too 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.890
 to have 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.920
 except that we eight technical error 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.090
 just because at second division from the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.560
 ballet where in the middle of the field 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.890
 let it lie and give as 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.540
 five push-doors just like us 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.850
 completely unnecessary the ball probably on the way 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.070
 lose and there we actually have 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.960
 no chance of a very good game 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:36.920
 half time was broken in the time was 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.650
 I found her sewage very good 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:46.200
 and we also have an increase 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.720
 all in all had something to attack 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.470
 our last play last game 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.890
 already had a problem with us and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.330
 That's why I'm completely satisfied 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.860
 that we won that was me spinning 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:06.270
 me the fans super einstand in one 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.600
 barefoot nephew of walt a good 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.120
 goalkeeper performance a transition of 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:18.380
 daughter nsn in defense and me too and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.520
 already a good day hiking 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.420
 Thanks for the statements 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:31.550
 ask the tactical involved 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:34.920
 reasons or was he injured injured 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.010
 torn muscle two weeks ago or until 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.750
 March had two weeks in training and 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.660
 could 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.330
 so far not play and me 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.830
 I already wanted to know how 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.630
 hard to be like today and because of us 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.180
 just in attack not so much 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.790
 came together when we partly with 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.680
 whole back room was new and in the garden 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.680
 seen that back like the front no 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.750
 did not fit any polls and then 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.250
 I tried a bit yesterday 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.590
 with the attack that he was so shaky but 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.520
 went well for attacks says ok 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.410
 try that and today I have that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.240
 the first two attacks three attacks 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.990
 tried and then I saw how 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:27.930
 It limps back and says 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:31.890
 before I drive out again 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:34.740
 or case hurt again then 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.640
 said okay then I have to stop making so 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.020
 like in lemgo 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:42.780
 then hope that we better me 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.910
 I hope he can play a bit longer 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.190
 in hamburg 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.190
 but that is critical needs 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:04.490
 No I have nothing I mean the one 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.440
 Asta they have 65 so they have new ones 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.560
 Gates made and fought nine goals 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.090
 of 13 the second half was yes 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.220
 Worse, that was almost all 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.850
 almost the collisions so that's not 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.780
 the mistake of the goalkeeper but that 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:26.389
 what a parade where I thought 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.570
 That should have and that is not enough 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:33.139
 thank you dollar back 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.370

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.750
