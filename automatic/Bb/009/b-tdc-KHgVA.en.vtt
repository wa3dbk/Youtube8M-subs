 The handle there also raises the table 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.170
 Is this of course yours? 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.670

 The images are different, I guess the children are different 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.520
 I can wear it 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.300
 It looks like not of this country 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.440
 It's too thick 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.240
 Or its 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.810
 Before the hand of Imagawa 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.810

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.660
 Met at the foolish question while we 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.960

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.230
 The place of the table is pearl 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.230
 The eyes seem not to be open by ward 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.150
 me 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.979

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 There will be no elephants in front of the other storehouses 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.930
 It's jealousy 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.920

 Fireworksman like a short life 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.010
 A little 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.969

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.969

 That's that it's so strong and big aura 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.099
 What do you mean 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.690
 The two auras can not be synchronized 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:27.510

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.510
