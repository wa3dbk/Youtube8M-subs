00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.840
 always good score all 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.759
 london have 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.490
 I'm going to introduce myself 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.029
 today do not detonate head 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:11.159
 themes 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 the reckless 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.959
 all troops 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.079
 we take you 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.060
 here's another finding that a more than three weeks of land 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.539
 they are four times thing that m 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 pay a shovel 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.399
 placed a father 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.099
 it can be done and that was something else in the stadium for the young woman 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.320
 was challenged quickly understand 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.030
 but what was the battle 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 an equal debt 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 4 5 six or seven 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.060
 10 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.389
 monthey vs 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.850
 so 1 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.750
 4 seck 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.830
 Swiss 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.400
 6 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.530
 a little more not deceived 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.530
 for this suite 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.100
 the example is all that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950
 I was wrong 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.620
 earthen 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 all his promises 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.080
 and while tr 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.040
 we have our chances historian 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.680
 but cash kuti fall 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 I am a citizen because I 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.590
 I think it was a public man 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.500
 who said he'd be ready for a home kit in Estonia 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.430
 and I think the question elysÃ©e how the case 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.189
 I came to the conclusion that such 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.189
 it was not worth it to rest 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 after he used to classify the formats to transform himself 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.500
 it's not sad 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 the simplest 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.860
 concerning the 6 th 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 the next track title trains 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 I turn overweight 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.960
 a morpion 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.320
 are we 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.050
 the whitecaps 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.480
 so in the first case the ramp 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.529
 finally the death of four years 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.529
 so that's how 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
 four five and six weeks 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.269
 if we need to go there 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.019
 he is someone very talented 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.139
 it's so worrying 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.489
 you bump and boxing 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.369
 strong winds 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:35.889
 4 5 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.589
 if the city orders 2007 8% and 4 days but I postulate at a speed 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.439
 and yes it will be a key point since the stone these moments 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 5 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.969
 optics tice 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.969
 it's here 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.769
 in fact it's chaos 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.519
 interesting spahic 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.519
 I guess so 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.839
 and especially for them 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.149
 this 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:25.149
 after you log in to a naval academy study 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.929
 maybe I understood how to select 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.929
 on a map 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.079
 basically this concert you explained 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:39.529
 each 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:40.859
 our case a year 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.359
 so it's two 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.359
 then everyone our talent 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:47.819
 - this 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.299
 strangled me I'll be there 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.869
 he is abandoned 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.139
 everyone will be 17 years old 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.569
 so we can on his first boat 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.229
 you need about fifty 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.149
 complete his first oslo boat 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.989
 a boat of 5 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.989
 23 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:12.149
 a boat from 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.789
 the boat was too little 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.789
 so here I place them next in May 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.919
 but of course you want of course 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.919
 a sport boat another 3 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.370
 so the game know it like that 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.110
 our opponent 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 in these sectors same thing to count on that plane 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.580
 so everybody needs these boats 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.069
 so there the boat presses I want only that one 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.300
 that person 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.569
 I mean she only has her eyes that block 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.599
 lack of pot 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.999
 so on the other side of other players 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.939
 it will be in turn 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.319
 he said at work she does not know everything and say that at 5 th her people 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.580
 he farted 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.789
 a touching stone 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.999
 and so a part of his boat the boats of the opponent 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.759
 just like those at the beginning 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.529
 it can be played 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.529
 aar 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.759
 so that's all I want to say is that this choice was to 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.419
 Earth 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.680
 but it's also true that he's a friend whatever you want 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.790
 the sto he does not know what it's longer for the map anymore 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:28.990
 late last night 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.150
 that's how you manage to cover such more confidence 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.120
 then if he 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.120
 ways to improve its share 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:41.419
 e 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.419
 waited all those of our possible chances style 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.390
 every time we fart a beyrouth stuff on a button and then 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.379
 5th child 1 6l on the side to say that we farted well boat 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.689
 to improve it as you want 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.029
 he will go elsewhere 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.469
 this country does not necessarily know parker 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.469
 because I am a league player 1 since people 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.490
 that the city continues this summer meanwhile the boat 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.180
 each one his turn 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.900
 the platform quoted boats 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.319
 find logistics led the boats 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.770
 first of the blocks 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.539
 few things 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.539
 we can imagine that these two clubs feel 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.259
 well side-by-side me I screw shifted an inch that a conveyor 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.419
 both sides 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.740
 it can quite be side-by-side 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.919
 the tombola 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.919
 I tell you to approach it because the submachine gun 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:41.419
 you miss 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.119
 this is very well done at the restaurants of the heart 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.119
 five hard-core areas 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.580
 There you go 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.489
 near the fence
