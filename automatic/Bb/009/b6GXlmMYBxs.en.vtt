00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
when Jen I play is a two-player game we

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.209 
when Jen I play is a two-player game we
keep<00:01:53.880> thinking<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.240> ourselves<00:01:54.270> wow<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.979> game

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.620 
keep thinking to ourselves wow this game
would<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.030> more<00:01:57.090> interesting<00:01:57.390> with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
would be so much more interesting with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
would be so much more interesting with
more<00:01:57.840> players<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.250> really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
more players because I'm really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.120 
more players because I'm really
surprised<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.329> there's<00:02:00.540> no<00:02:00.869> scaling<00:02:01.500> for

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
surprised that there's no scaling for

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039 
surprised that there's no scaling for
two<00:02:02.280> players<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> exact

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
two players you know there's the exact

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.539 
two players you know there's the exact
same<00:02:04.259> number<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> work<00:02:04.680> replacement<00:02:05.189> spaces

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
same number of work replacement spaces

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.719 
same number of work replacement spaces
and<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.229> there's<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.550> with

only two players the Pirates are much
less<00:02:11.280> likely<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.819> hit<00:02:11.940> us<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.599> there

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
less likely to hit us you know if there

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.680 
less likely to hit us you know if there
are<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:12.989> players

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
are more players

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.270 
are more players
head<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:13.990> over<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.380> board<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.070> Pirates

head all over the board the Pirates

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920 
head all over the board the Pirates
every<00:02:15.700> turn<00:02:15.880> are<00:02:16.060> very<00:02:16.270> likely<00:02:16.420> getting<00:02:16.750> hit

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
every turn are very likely getting hit

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.840 
every turn are very likely getting hit
somebody<00:02:17.290> but<00:02:17.440> Jen<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.770> we've<00:02:18.040> had<00:02:18.280> almost

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
somebody but Jen I we've had almost

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.580 
somebody but Jen I we've had almost
entire<00:02:19.270> games<00:02:19.600> were<00:02:19.840> hey<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.260> know<00:02:20.440> what

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
entire games were hey you know what

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.930 
entire games were hey you know what
every<00:02:21.010> German<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.340> Pirates<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.790> keep

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
every German the Pirates just keep

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.460 
every German the Pirates just keep
missing<00:02:22.300> over<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.780> over<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.020> over<00:02:23.110> again<00:02:23.230> so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
missing over and over and over again so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.500 
missing over and over and over again so
they<00:02:23.590> become<00:02:23.710> almost<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.700> know<00:02:24.760> uh<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.210> non

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
they become almost you know uh a non

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.580 
they become almost you know uh a non
entity<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.650> game<00:02:26.890> because<00:02:27.820> we<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.990> be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
entity in the game because we on be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.260 
entity in the game because we on be
because<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.070> board<00:02:30.310> didn't<00:02:30.730> tighten<00:02:30.910> up<00:02:31.060> as<00:02:31.210> a

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
because the board didn't tighten up as a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.910 
because the board didn't tighten up as a
two-player<00:02:31.570> game<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.990> then<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.380> top<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> that

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
two-player game and then on top of that

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620 
two-player game and then on top of that
we<00:02:33.460> found<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.970> there<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.300> really<00:02:34.450> wasn't

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
we found that there just really wasn't

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.260 
we found that there just really wasn't
that<00:02:35.260> much<00:02:35.650> tension<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.640> always<00:02:36.820> ideal<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
that much tension it's always ideal to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.490 
that much tension it's always ideal to
go<00:02:37.360> first<00:02:37.570> because<00:02:37.750> there's<00:02:37.960> always<00:02:38.260> one

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
go first because there's always one

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.230 
go first because there's always one
space<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> best<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.820> there's<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.150> many

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
space it's the best but there's so many

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.060 
space it's the best but there's so many
other<00:02:40.450> spaces<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.560> good<00:02:41.830> as

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
other spaces that are really good as

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.490 
other spaces that are really good as
well<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.910> mean<00:02:43.270> hey<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.900> didn't<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
well I mean hey if you didn't get the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.220 
well I mean hey if you didn't get the
space<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.370> want<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.640> mind<00:02:45.880> well<00:02:46.360> then<00:02:46.810> your

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
space you want to mind well then your

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.450 
space you want to mind well then your
first<00:02:47.380> move<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.710> be<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.920> rover<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
first move can be the rover so that you

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.890 
first move can be the rover so that you
can<00:02:48.610> still<00:02:48.820> get<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.060> there<00:02:49.210> if<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.450> need<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
can still get in there if you need to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.610 
can still get in there if you need to
and<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.890> yo<00:02:51.550> oh<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> didn't<00:02:52.330> get<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
and I'm yo oh you didn't get the the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.020 
and I'm yo oh you didn't get the the
dark<00:02:53.830> vortex<00:02:54.310> because<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.670> were<00:02:54.760> worried

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
dark vortex because you were worried

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.520 
dark vortex because you were worried
about<00:02:55.090> mitigating<00:02:55.600> well<00:02:55.840> then<00:02:55.960> just<00:02:56.080> take<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
about mitigating well then just take the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.800 
about mitigating well then just take the
precision<00:02:56.920> engineering<00:02:57.280> instead<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:58.570> up

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
precision engineering instead because up

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.960 
precision engineering instead because up
with<00:02:59.260> only<00:02:59.440> two<00:02:59.560> players<00:02:59.920> there<00:03:00.490> are<00:03:00.640> plenty

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
with only two players there are plenty

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.520 
with only two players there are plenty
of<00:03:01.240> space<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.450> go<00:03:01.570> around<00:03:01.720> oh<00:03:01.930> well<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.500> know

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
of space to go around oh well you know

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.780 
of space to go around oh well you know
what<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.770> turn<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:02.980> guess<00:03:03.220> I'll<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.370> do<00:03:03.580> some

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
what this turn I guess I'll just do some

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.820 
what this turn I guess I'll just do some
solar<00:03:04.060> collecting<00:03:04.690> instead<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.290> doing

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
solar collecting instead of doing

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.260 
solar collecting instead of doing
harvesting<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.760> best<00:03:06.940> space<00:03:07.090> is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
harvesting because the best space is

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.810 
harvesting because the best space is
already<00:03:07.480> taken<00:03:07.810> now<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.470> suspect<00:03:09.190> with<00:03:09.550> more

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
already taken now I suspect with more

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.640 
already taken now I suspect with more
players<00:03:10.150> these<00:03:10.810> spaces<00:03:11.140> are<00:03:11.350> going<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.560> get

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
players these spaces are going to get

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.010 
players these spaces are going to get
gobbled<00:03:11.830> up<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.160> lot<00:03:12.340> faster<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.180> delegate

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
gobbled up a lot faster and the delegate

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.360 
gobbled up a lot faster and the delegate
action<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.710> become<00:03:14.920> much<00:03:15.190> more

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
seems like 24 in our two behind just a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.600 
seems like 24 in our two behind just a
slightly<00:04:38.410> missed<00:04:38.740> opportunity<00:04:39.250> we'd<00:04:39.370> still

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
slightly missed opportunity we'd still

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.970 
slightly missed opportunity we'd still
enjoy<00:04:39.910> playing<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:41.050> really<00:04:41.380> as<00:04:41.710> we're

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
enjoy playing it but really as we're

enjoy playing it but really as we're
playing<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.280> two<00:04:42.370> player<00:04:42.550> game<00:04:42.670> we're

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.400 
playing is two player game we're
constantly<00:04:43.000> thinking<00:04:43.330> man<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.810> we<00:04:44.320> had

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
constantly thinking man if we had

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.810 
constantly thinking man if we had
another<00:04:44.590> player<00:04:44.860> here<00:04:45.100> that'd<00:04:45.460> be<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.640> lot<00:04:45.760> more

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
another player here that'd be a lot more

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.550 
another player here that'd be a lot more
interesting<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:46.630> really<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.960> shame<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.410> game

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
interesting it's really a shame the game

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.690 
interesting it's really a shame the game
didn't<00:04:47.770> come<00:04:47.890> up<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.040> sound<00:04:48.220> like<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> know

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
didn't come up a sound like you know

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.140 
didn't come up a sound like you know
dummy<00:04:49.090> players<00:04:49.420> like<00:04:50.130> what<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.190> call<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.580> the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
dummy players like what you call it the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.580 
dummy players like what you call it the
way<00:04:52.270> dungeon<00:04:52.660> pets<00:04:52.900> works<00:04:53.170> where<00:04:53.380> there's<00:04:53.530> a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
way dungeon pets works where there's a

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.440 
way dungeon pets works where there's a
dummy<00:04:53.770> player<00:04:54.070> who<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.670> moves<00:04:55.000> or<00:04:55.240> there's

dummy player who just moves or there's

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
dummy player who just moves or there's
like<00:04:55.540> you<00:04:55.810> know<00:04:55.840> multiple<00:04:55.960> dummy<00:04:56.260> players

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
like you know multiple dummy players

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.800 
like you know multiple dummy players
that<00:04:56.560> move<00:04:56.740> clockwise<00:04:57.210> always<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.420> can<00:04:58.450> see

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
that move clockwise always you can see

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.720 
that move clockwise always you can see
you<00:04:59.290> can<00:04:59.440> plan<00:04:59.740> right<00:05:00.070> next<00:05:00.370> turn<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> dummy

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
you can plan right next turn the dummy

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
you can plan right next turn the dummy
players<00:05:00.940> are<00:05:01.000> going<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.150> occupy<00:05:01.510> this<00:05:01.570> space

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
players are going to occupy this space

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.720 
players are going to occupy this space
or<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.230> space<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.650> space<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.490> board

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
or this space of this space so the board

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.100 
or this space of this space so the board
will<00:05:03.940> get<00:05:04.060> tightened<00:05:04.450> up<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:04.930> things

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
will get tightened up so that things

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.990 
will get tightened up so that things
will<00:05:05.230> get<00:05:05.290> much<00:05:05.350> more<00:05:05.650> challenging<00:05:05.980> then<00:05:06.970> I

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
will get much more challenging then I

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.400 
will get much more challenging then I
think<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.480> two<00:05:07.630> player<00:05:07.840> would<00:05:07.990> really<00:05:08.200> start

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
think the two player would really start

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.380 
think the two player would really start
to<00:05:08.530> sing<00:05:08.770> much<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.760> does<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.030> Dungeon

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
to sing much like it does in Dungeon

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.150 
to sing much like it does in Dungeon
pets<00:05:10.570> where<00:05:10.840> they<00:05:11.260> didn't<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.710> know<00:05:11.800> tighten

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
pets where they didn't you know tighten

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.770 
pets where they didn't you know tighten
up<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.340> board<00:05:12.580> they<00:05:12.970> just<00:05:13.180> put<00:05:13.330> dummy<00:05:13.540> players

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
up the board they just put dummy players

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.390 
up the board they just put dummy players
who<00:05:13.990> followed<00:05:14.350> very<00:05:14.380> simple<00:05:14.980> prescriptive

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
who followed very simple prescriptive

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.130 
who followed very simple prescriptive
paths<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.940> think<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.360> game<00:05:16.480> really<00:05:16.840> could<00:05:17.110> have

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
paths I think the game really could have

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.720 
paths I think the game really could have
used<00:05:17.230> that<00:05:17.500> but<00:05:18.010> again<00:05:18.190> that's<00:05:18.340> only<00:05:18.610> a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
used that but again that's only a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.060 
used that but again that's only a
complaint<00:05:19.150> for<00:05:19.300> two<00:05:19.480> players<00:05:19.720> if<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.140> are

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
complaint for two players if you are

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.290 
complaint for two players if you are
gonna<00:05:21.250> be<00:05:21.370> playing<00:05:21.580> with<00:05:21.670> more<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:22.090> don't<00:05:22.270> think

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300
