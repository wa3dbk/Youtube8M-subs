00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.799
 hello to all of us who are again with a 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.380
 new video on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.710
 teach them how they can discover the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.900
 key of your wifi network or the password is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.089
 a very simple process very easy this 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.789
 It is very useful especially when we invite 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.999
 to a friend some relative to our 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.580
 house and so that he does not spend his network of 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:36.680
 internet on the mobile we will provide 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.440
 what is the password of our 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.570
 router or our private internet 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.330
 but to not go to what root is to look at 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.400
 under try to dictate sometimes we 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.250
 we made a mistake because the password can 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.130
 that has a tiny upper case and is very 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.500
 very difficult however there is an option 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.900
 from the same computer in this case a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.650
 computer with windows operating system 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.620
 in this case windows 8.1 there is a way 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.799
 very easy and fast to know what it is 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 the password of our internet wifi 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.610
 then 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.579
 copy it and paste it or simply be it 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.409
 we share by mail by or by 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.200
 the facebook or simply we can 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.119
 also share by the whatsapp for 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 that there is no error 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.039
 in our friend our family can 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.929
 connect to our internet wifi from the 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.380
 Easiest and fastest way to do it 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.240
 we just go to where our 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.299
 connection as you can see here we are going to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.060
 right click and let's go to what 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.549
 is to open the network center and resources 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.319
 shared will open a window 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.409
 as you can appreciate here and we're going to 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:48.349
 put let's execute what is the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.840
 connection of our wifi and let's go to 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:53.209
 the option where it says properties 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.489
 wireless and within properties 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.039
 wireless we're going to go to the option of 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:00.470
 where it says security and how can you see 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.979
 here it says here network security key 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.289
 We click here or dove here or 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.300
 wifi we simply copy it we paste it 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 in some file 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.680
 we must share already I tell you by what 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.650

 your password finding out from 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.480
 your computer without going to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 what I went to finish below try 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.440
 tedious and also very heavy this method 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.750
