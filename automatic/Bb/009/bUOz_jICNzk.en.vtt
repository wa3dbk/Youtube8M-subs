remove this gasket pull the center bolt

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.179 
remove this gasket pull the center bolt
off<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:59.239> this<00:01:00.239> will<00:01:00.420> pretty<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:01.010> fall<00:01:02.010> apart

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
off and this will pretty much fall apart

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:13.760 
off and this will pretty much fall apart
lots<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.339> pieces<00:01:06.260> when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.560> few<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> them

the<00:01:20.490> bolt<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.780> either

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the bolt that's here you can either

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
the bolt that's here you can either
replace<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> bolt<00:01:22.530> I've<00:01:22.920> drilled<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
replace the bolt I've drilled this out a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
replace the bolt I've drilled this out a
little<00:01:24.270> bit<00:01:24.390> which<00:01:24.600> doesn't<00:01:25.020> seem<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.350> have

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
little bit which doesn't seem to have

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.649 
little bit which doesn't seem to have
worked<00:01:25.649> so<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> will<00:01:26.729> probably<00:01:26.939> put<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> smaller

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
worked so I will probably put a smaller

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.490 
worked so I will probably put a smaller
bolt<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.220> later<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.610> we're<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.759> to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
bolt in later so here we're going to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.050 
bolt in later so here we're going to
click<00:01:34.500> tower<00:01:34.710> wires<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> strip

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
bringing the heat shrink up if you don't

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.940 
bringing the heat shrink up if you don't
have<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> heat<00:02:41.170> gun<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.319> can<00:02:41.530> use<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.739> lighter

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
have a heat gun you can use the lighter

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
have a heat gun you can use the lighter
just<00:02:42.189> don't<00:02:42.879> hold<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.209> one<00:02:43.299> spot<00:02:43.359> for<00:02:43.750> too

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
just don't hold it in one spot for too

00:02:43.810 --> 00:03:02.050 
just don't hold it in one spot for too
long

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.770 

so<00:03:02.750> we<00:03:02.810> repeat<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.170> for<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.410> other<00:03:03.470> three<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
so we repeat that for the other three so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.540 
so we repeat that for the other three so
now<00:03:05.900> that<00:03:05.959> we<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.290> new<00:03:06.440> female<00:03:07.220> Spade

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
now that we have new female Spade

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.070 
now that we have new female Spade
connectors<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.450> all<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.810> our<00:03:08.900> wires<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:11.209> placed

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
connectors on all of our wires I placed

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.970 
connectors on all of our wires I placed
the<00:03:12.200> rectifier<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:12.680> here

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the rectifier on here

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.100 
the rectifier on here
I<00:03:13.010> do<00:03:13.250> not<00:03:13.459> currently<00:03:13.940> have<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.300> bolt<00:03:14.569> small

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
I do not currently have a bolt small

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.500 
I do not currently have a bolt small
enough<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.380> fit<00:03:15.500> through<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.670> later<00:03:16.940> I'm<00:03:17.390> going

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
enough to fit through so later I'm going

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.530 
enough to fit through so later I'm going
to<00:03:17.600> have<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.780> find<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.110> bolt<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.130> will<00:03:19.540> pull

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
to have to find a bolt that will pull

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.630 
to have to find a bolt that will pull
this<00:03:20.630> plate<00:03:20.840> off<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.080> I'll<00:03:21.260> mount<00:03:21.410> through<00:03:21.739> so

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
this plate off and I'll mount through so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.460 
this plate off and I'll mount through so
that<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.000> bolt<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.360> right<00:03:24.020> up<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.319> there

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
that I can bolt this right up to there

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.949 
that I can bolt this right up to there
but<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.550> now<00:03:25.670> just<00:03:25.880> for<00:03:26.270> demonstration<00:03:26.840> we'll

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
but for now just for demonstration we'll

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.760 
but for now just for demonstration we'll
leave<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.350> there<00:03:29.080> so<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> way<00:03:30.290> this<00:03:30.410> works<00:03:30.620> if

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
leave it there so the way this works if

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.410 
leave it there so the way this works if
you<00:03:30.890> have<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.250> your<00:03:31.850> spades<00:03:34.180> three<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.269> them

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
you have your your spades three of them

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.810 
you have your your spades three of them
will<00:03:35.570> face<00:03:36.040> horizontally<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:37.430> vertically

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
will face horizontally one vertically

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.270 
will face horizontally one vertically
will<00:03:37.940> be<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> top<00:03:38.360> right<00:03:39.010> then<00:03:40.010> your

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
will be on the top right then your

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.020 
will be on the top right then your
yellow<00:03:40.550> one<00:03:40.989> goes<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.260> top<00:03:42.410> left<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.940> you

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
yellow one goes on the top left so you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.350 
yellow one goes on the top left so you
got<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> little<00:03:44.330> wire<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.290> then<00:03:46.100> your<00:03:46.489> red<00:03:47.330> and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
got a little wire and then your red and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.630 
got a little wire and then your red and
white<00:03:47.540> wire<00:03:47.900> goes<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.840> vertical<00:03:50.840> today

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
white wire goes on the vertical today

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.540 
white wire goes on the vertical today
and<00:03:52.640> your<00:03:53.510> pink<00:03:53.900> wire<00:03:54.200> will<00:03:55.130> go<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.430> bottom

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
and your pink wire will go on the bottom

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.259 
and your pink wire will go on the bottom
right<00:03:55.850> now<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:57.410> old<00:03:57.650> rectifier<00:03:58.610> grounded

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
right now the old rectifier grounded

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.509 
right now the old rectifier grounded
through<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> middle<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.110> the<00:04:00.200> frame<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:01.310> new

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
through the middle to the frame this new

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.729 
through the middle to the frame this new
one<00:04:01.760> will<00:04:02.720> be<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.840> ground<00:04:03.110> left<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:03.470> I've<00:04:03.560> made<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
one will be a ground left so I've made a

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.979 
one will be a ground left so I've made a
new<00:04:04.060> black<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.239> white<00:04:05.330> wire<00:04:05.480> it<00:04:05.690> can<00:04:05.780> be<00:04:05.870> any

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
new black and white wire it can be any

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.140 
new black and white wire it can be any
color<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.670> keep<00:04:07.670> track

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
color just keep track

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.810 
color just keep track
I<00:04:08.180> believe<00:04:09.079> Hondas<00:04:09.620> ground<00:04:09.980> colors<00:04:10.310> usually

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
I believe Hondas ground colors usually

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.680 
I believe Hondas ground colors usually
green<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.140> can<00:04:12.290> keep<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:13.690> continuity

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
green so if you can keep in continuity

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.900 
green so if you can keep in continuity
with<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.170> I'm<00:04:15.380> sure<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.620> would<00:04:15.739> be<00:04:15.910> easier

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
with that I'm sure it would be easier

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.229 
with that I'm sure it would be easier
for<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.310> now<00:04:19.310> we're<00:04:19.489> all<00:04:19.609> wired<00:04:19.820> up<00:04:20.060> I

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
for you and now we're all wired up I

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.060 
for you and now we're all wired up I
just<00:04:20.479> have<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.720> ground<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.590> out<00:04:21.769> I'm<00:04:21.950> going

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
just have to ground this out I'm going

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.860 
just have to ground this out I'm going
to<00:04:22.130> ground<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.490> along<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:23.479> put<00:04:23.690> a<00:04:23.720> new

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
to ground it along and put a new

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.650 
to ground it along and put a new
connector<00:04:24.320> like<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.370> will<00:04:26.150> ground<00:04:26.390> it<00:04:26.539> in

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
connector like this will ground it in

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.640 
connector like this will ground it in
together<00:04:26.810> with<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:28.039> battery<00:04:28.370> ground<00:04:29.650> and

together with the battery ground and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.370 
together with the battery ground and
