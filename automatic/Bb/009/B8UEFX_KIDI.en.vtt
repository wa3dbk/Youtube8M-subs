very very average and it's got very low

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.029 
very very average and it's got very low
chemistry<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.140> does<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.500> an<00:01:01.620> informed

but<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:13.109> just<00:04:13.319> didn't<00:04:13.560> look<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.709> apparently

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
but it just didn't look like apparently

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.550

nice<00:04:23.970> cool<00:04:24.180> they're<00:04:24.390> just<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.870> past<00:04:25.169> his

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
nice cool they're just going past his

goalkeeper<00:04:25.680> actually<00:04:26.340> don't<00:04:26.700> know<00:04:26.789> why<00:04:26.940> I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
goalkeeper actually don't know why I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.780 
goalkeeper actually don't know why I
didn't<00:04:27.270> save<00:04:27.419> it

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
didn't save it

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.120 
didn't save it
guess<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.660> AI<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.140> bit<00:04:29.320> dumb<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.770> that<00:04:29.890> and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
guess the AI is a bit dumb for that and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.850 
guess the AI is a bit dumb for that and
but<00:04:30.730> we<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.540> actually<00:04:31.630> level<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.380> back<00:04:32.530> up<00:04:32.710> at

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
but we do actually level it back up at

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.650 
but we do actually level it back up at

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
had any opportunities it was just very

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.240 
had any opportunities it was just very
very<00:05:18.630> very<00:05:19.630> small<00:05:20.290> opportunities<00:05:20.890> that<00:05:21.100> were

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
very very small opportunities that were

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.430 
very very small opportunities that were
you<00:05:21.850> know<00:05:21.880> anything<00:05:22.540> close<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.990> goal<00:05:23.200> so

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
you know anything close to a goal so

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.230 
you know anything close to a goal so
that<00:05:23.920> was<00:05:24.040> how<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.370> game<00:05:24.550> ended<00:05:24.730> and<00:05:25.000> we<00:05:25.030> did

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
that was how that game ended and we did

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.730 
that was how that game ended and we did
when<00:05:25.450> we<00:05:25.480> you<00:05:25.930> know<00:05:26.020> we've<00:05:26.170> got<00:05:26.290> another<00:05:26.530> win

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
when we you know we've got another win

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.530 
when we you know we've got another win
on<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.010> board<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.430> cannot<00:05:27.790> believe<00:05:27.850> we<00:05:28.150> be<00:05:28.360> that

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
on the board I cannot believe we be that

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.390 
on the board I cannot believe we be that
guy<00:05:28.690> because<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.260> did<00:05:29.410> not<00:05:29.530> expect<00:05:29.830> it<00:05:30.010> he

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
guy because I just did not expect it he

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.740 
guy because I just did not expect it he
seemed<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.640> be<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.880> better<00:05:31.000> player<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.450> me<00:05:31.600> you

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
seemed to be the better player of me you

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.030 
seemed to be the better player of me you
know<00:05:31.780> because<00:05:31.900> they<00:05:32.230> having<00:05:32.470> more<00:05:32.650> chances

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
know because they having more chances

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.890 
know because they having more chances
and<00:05:33.250> stuff<00:05:33.430> but<00:05:33.640> I<00:05:33.880> just<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.600> guess<00:05:34.750> I<00:05:34.870> just

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
and stuff but I just I guess I just

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.780 
and stuff but I just I guess I just
capitalized<00:05:35.770> on<00:05:35.920> my<00:05:36.040> opportunities<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:36.760> I

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
capitalized on my opportunities and I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.340 
capitalized on my opportunities and I
guess<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.090> took<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.450> only<00:05:37.600> two<00:05:37.900> girls<00:05:38.140> that<00:05:38.320> I

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
guess I took the only two girls that I

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.650 
guess I took the only two girls that I
needed<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:38.860> one<00:05:39.640> in<00:05:39.700> that<00:05:39.790> game<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.210> as<00:05:40.570> you

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
needed so one in that game and as you

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.330 
needed so one in that game and as you
can<00:05:40.780> see<00:05:40.810> I<00:05:40.930> had<00:05:41.200> three<00:05:41.590> shots<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.070> he<00:05:42.220> had<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
can see I had three shots and he had I

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.540 
can see I had three shots and he had I
think<00:05:42.520> six<00:05:43.060> or<00:05:43.270> eight<00:05:43.540> so<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.440> know<00:05:44.530> hats<00:05:45.430> off

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
think six or eight so you know hats off

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.890 
think six or eight so you know hats off
to<00:05:45.700> him<00:05:45.790> you<00:05:46.000> know<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.210> kind<00:05:46.390> of<00:05:46.510> probably

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
to him you know it kind of probably

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.740 
to him you know it kind of probably
deserved<00:05:47.560> that<00:05:47.650> win<00:05:47.890> but<00:05:48.160> um<00:05:48.600> against<00:05:49.600> I<00:05:49.630> was

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
deserved that win but um against I was

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.060 
deserved that win but um against I was

seem very very good players but i think

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.479 
seem very very good players but i think
if<00:06:52.839> i<00:06:53.019> was<00:06:53.259> to<00:06:53.289> decide<00:06:53.919> i<00:06:53.949> think<00:06:54.279> i<00:06:54.369> would

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:54.489 
if i was to decide i think i would

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:56.369 
if i was to decide i think i would
choose<00:06:54.669> you<00:06:54.849> che<00:06:55.149> mainly<00:06:55.809> because<00:06:55.929> of<00:06:56.110> that

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:56.379 
choose you che mainly because of that

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.989 
choose you che mainly because of that
four<00:06:56.679> star<00:06:56.919> skimmers<00:06:57.249> and<00:06:57.279> three<00:06:57.669> style<00:06:57.909> week

four star skimmers and three style week

00:06:57.999 --> 00:06:59.459 
four star skimmers and three style week
but<00:06:58.209> i<00:06:58.239> think<00:06:58.449> i<00:06:58.539> would<00:06:58.599> be<00:06:58.779> able<00:06:58.809> to<00:06:59.169> do<00:06:59.289> some

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.439 
but i think i would be able to do some
nice<00:06:59.649> goals<00:06:59.919> and<00:07:00.159> that<00:07:00.699> create<00:07:01.059> some<00:07:01.269> nice

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
nice goals and that create some nice

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
footage with the force discovers that it

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.779
