00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 There are a lot of switches with light and shadow quietness 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Water and wind The beauty of green One by one 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I realized that there was no wall 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Light and shadow There are many thoughts that were trapped 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 I open the doors one by one by lighting and opening. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I realized that there was no wall 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 The hand is offered to connect 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Jumped over the impossible distance 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 Even forced deployment 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 A world of nodding 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 It's a reflection, it's wandering around, it's foggy 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 I didn't have much anxiety 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 The key to open the door further is in the words I finally understood 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 I realized that there was no wall 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The hand is offered to connect 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Jumped over the impossible distance 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Even forced deployment 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 A world of nodding
