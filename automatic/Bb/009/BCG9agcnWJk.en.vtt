00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.130
 or not 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.660
 and what wave friends welcome to a new 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.000
 video tutorial of this channel in this 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.800
 occasion returning a bit to what is coming 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.200
 being social networks and thus a 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.760
 utility that is already very necessary in 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.410
 that has to do with those we use 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.140
 the instagram social network 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.119
 as we know instagram is a social network 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.919
 of photographs that allow us to use 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.650
 filters and all this because 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.810
 express ourselves only through photographs and 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.090
 then some small problems arise 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.000
 in what has to do with the issuance of 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.710
 photographs because it gives us instagram a 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.190
 framework in which we must 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.680
 center a photo that frame is a scale 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.079
 square and sometimes we find that 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.699
 we take a picture with the smartphone 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.129
 with the iphone or with any 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.530
 device that has the application of 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.899
 a horizontal way in a way 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.550
 horizontal and a vertical way and then 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.589
 the photo in no way fits very 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.480
 well in that framework what we're going to do 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.100
 today is to complement that so that 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.920
 so the photograph is centered on the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.159
 square scale and then we can issue 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.780
 that photo with the full range of the camera 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.820
 that is to say with everything taken by the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 camera then to do 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.560
 I'm just going to show you first 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.840
 what is the problem and then we will see 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 the immediate solution to this problem 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 first I will enter what is coming 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.619
 being my instagram account in my 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.080
 instagram account as they see simply 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.740
 I have several images here I'm going to open 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.390
 for example a picture an image and you 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.790
 I will show what the problem is with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.009
 this type of images that are taken to 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.840
 very high scales for example here I have 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.729
 some images that are very scaled 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 high but then leave me the selection 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.710
 right now and we start editing here I have 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.420
 one that is logically vertical and 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 as you are watching it just fits 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.280
 part of the photograph does not fit all and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.750
 Well, we just have to leave it there 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.289
 but I want in this case to leave 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.539
 my feet and everything but I can not because 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.090
 because the cut does not leave me then for 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.649
 that's going to be today's tutorial 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.099
 we're just going to go to the store 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.569
 to the app store is an application that we 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.319
 will solve all this that will not 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.230
 other than placing borders on the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.090
 which we can use the scale 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.739
 square to visualize the whole picture the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.049
 application as you are watching it 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.790
 call no crop so you are going to type 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.439
 up here and they are going to look for it is a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.000
 application that is totally free in 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.709
 the store and this is what we are 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.269
 visualizing right now you 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.859
 they will simply give you in download and 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.650
 then in opening I will simply give you in 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:43.859
 open because logically that has 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.930
 downloaded because it has been very useful for me 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.139
 well here good let's see I do not have and we give 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
 here in importing we give in 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.840
 import and we can select the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.209
 photography that we want 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 frame on a square scale in this 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.480
 I will select the same 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.689
 photograph logically so they can see 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.450
 Well, the effect that works and so 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.000
 that is working wonderfully 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.980
 on the square scale this time 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.720
 well here is the picture I put it and 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.040
 as you are seeing this is a 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.409
 square square of sant the squares 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.180
 here this is instagram scale and I 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.800
 puts it in the middle ok 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.960
 there will be complete complete 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.670
 the edges that are missing to the side 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.140
 logically the background color of 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.240
 instagram to make it look like it does not have 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.450
 no edge added then 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.700
 I will simply give you to give up here and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.890
 then simply select and instagram 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.200
 this time there if you 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.670
 they want to share on facebook the twitter 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.680
 you can also give it to her but 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.840
 in this case I only on instagram would give 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.370
 there and then one leads me to what 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.530
 have to see my instagram screen 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.470
 as you are seeing the image 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.910
 full auto in an automatic way 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.860
 how are you looking at the boxes 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.600
 whites and here this opens that trace 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.980
 is the same instagram color in the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.090
 social network in the outside is 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 say that we will only see as if 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.350
 we would have uploaded this image in its 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.700
 full scale ok I recommend you to put 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.730
 no effect unless it is a 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.980
 blur because then the truth of this one 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.540
 if you put an effect on it when 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.550
 it will change and it would seem as it is 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.230
 edited ok then well I just 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.880
 I will give in next 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.560
 I will put a description or just 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.930
 zoom out in the default description of 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.760
 the application and I will give you in share 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.590
 Now let's see how photography 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.540
 it was placed and as you are 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.620
 appreciating you do not notice that he was with 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.479
 edges or anything but 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.570
 and it shows that I simply had 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.979
 uploaded the photo in its total texture ok 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.720
 well, that in conclusion has been the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.729
 video and video today for hope 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.350
