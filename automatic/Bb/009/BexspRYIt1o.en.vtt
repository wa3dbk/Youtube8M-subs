00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 Hello everyone and today on my channel 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.429
 will have a review on hair cosmetics from 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.780
 kerastase I had a care line 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.639
 for dry hair 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.740
 I will tell whether she liked me or not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 if you're interested then stay with 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
 me all that you now see it 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.020
 the result of using this system from 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.090
 kerastase 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 but now I want to go through each 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.279
 all funds individually 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 there were three and I supplemented this system you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 oil elixir ultimate 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.360
 The first remedy is a shampoo bath in the afternoon 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 It was 80 milliliters this means at me 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 ended the very first 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 I first him to enjoy so 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.789
 ponemnozhechku poured but when it is seen 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 that Khan does not foam at all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.800
 I have already used the value and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.379
 about I had this shampoo on 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.329
 8 applications respectively can 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.420
 make a conclusion if you buy the full 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.480
 the size is long you will not have enough 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.910
 does not dry hair like other shampoos 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 some say so shampoo and not that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 effect that you know sometimes the head 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.700
 wash and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 I just did not want to touch 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 they are so dry it doesn't even seem 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.710
 straw you call no this effect no 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.850
 he makes them a little softer 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 not bad washing your head but some 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 special effect and special role in the care 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 I do not play for myself therefore I do not see 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 meaning to buy 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.369
 full version the next tool is 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 there were 75 milliliters in it and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.150
 was spent but of course more 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.299
 more economical than for example shampoo 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.320
 for all this line is about the same 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.810
 he is not persistent unobtrusive and pretty 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.210
 enjoyable this tool is used as 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.020
 approximately apply conditioner to hair 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.060
 go three minutes and wash off 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.240
 further you must have a soft voice and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.429
 but let's say if we compare this tool 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.039
 with garnett setting with mask I 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.990
 Of course I understand that in comparison is not very 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.210
 because garnier is a mass market 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 kerastase is a luxury but 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.310
 effect from garnier and 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.590
 much cooler garnier wins a hundred 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.660
 percent I thought maybe there is 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.390
 some cumulative effect of this 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.849
 funds waited but funds already 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 over and the desire to buy a full 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.160
 the size of me and the third means this 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.819
 The first defense in it was 50 milliliters 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.410
 and it is the most economical among previous 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.780
 I, by the way, liked the tools more 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.239
 you just put it on wet hair 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.000
 rub it slightly with a towel 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.180
 leave listen to your head and after that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.680
 your hair is softer laying them 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.620
 nice to touch 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.660
 new means of action she is not 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.019
 long term as soon as you go out in 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.360
 rain or what kind of wet weather 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.190
 you immediately become a dandelion to me 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.620
 This tool is most liked 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.900
 use paired with oil elixir 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.730
 Ultimate Oil Elixir Ultimate I Have It 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.639
 I use every day but despite this 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.680
 I still have 2 3 flakonchik at first I 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.540
 used it very carefully because 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.840
 that many said that you can with him 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.760
 go too far and didnâ€™t see the wow effect 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.340
 who all spoke only after 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.549
 how am i sizing it 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.150
 I saw this advertising effect hair 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.730
 to the hair 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.040
 a lot of really tired hair 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.430
 smooth scales and they become 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.739
 smooth and soft shiny cool 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.099
 as i also used it as 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.639
 thermal protection applied to the hair bathe 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.130
 by ear 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.370
 and this effect kept me about 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.349
 debt to the next purchase of the head but this one 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.269
 oils have the same mercy as u 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.000
 previous atrocities as soon as you 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.489
 get wet trails rain 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.299
 the effect is almost gone you 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.299
 become 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.459
 Immediately in the end shampoo bath 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.190
 and I did not like milk and not 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.870
 Approached as thermal protection and oil by 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.850
 separately in full size 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.949
 I would not take them if only together 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.989
 maybe it's just not my line 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.940
 kerastase taken away from them here to try 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.310
 something different but today i have everything 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.100
 such was my opinion write your opinion
