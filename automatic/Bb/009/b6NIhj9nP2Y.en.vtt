00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.380
 break that stone with your hands is very 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.390
 hard 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:12.850
 [Music] 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.180
 if one day you want to be worthy to carry the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.910
 armor 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.080
 you have to be able to break them 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.360
 [Music] 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.490
 you will have to learn to concentrate and 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.439
 direct all your energies to a single 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 point to get a force 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.100
 supernatural you have understood to cry 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.090
 it's no use 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.370
 [Music] 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.740
 says that he is able to carry the power of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.270
 chile to unimaginable levels until 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.240
 become invincible 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.970
 what makes you invincible 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.460
 exercising and transferring chi to 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.700
 correct parts of my body hit my 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.010
 body as much as possible until it is done 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.780
 as strong as a steel armor 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 very well let's see what you can do 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.850
 [Music] 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.550
 what I am about to do is very 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.940
 dangerous to use an electric drill 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.590
 in your body this could cause a 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 very serious injury including death a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:26.190
 normal person do not try it at home 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:28.740
 [Music] 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.350
 and ready 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.950
 [Music] 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.950
 10 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.890
 that was seriously I could see how her skin 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.890
 it was crooked 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.740
 now he prepares to drill his 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.960
 throat 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.960
 [Music] 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.280
 wow 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:26.780
 it's amazing 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:29.520
 [Music] 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.989
 incredible that was for real percent there 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.989
 blood in the neck and in the drill 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.160
 because it did not pierce his neck 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 it happens I really do not know no doubt 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.420
 that in a little bit the drill that went through 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.520
 the first layer of stone because not the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.030
 Pierce I do not know but drilled the wood 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.890
 he did I want to know if he's just 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.470
 holding the drill or if you really do not 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.860
 is pushing towards your body you can 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.680
 see here that the pressure goes from 14 to 20 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.450
 newtons per square centimeter I want 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.820
 make sure I have what happens if the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.950
 pressure is 20 newtons that means 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.650
 that all that strength goes straight to your 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.629
 neck strength goes towards your neck 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.080
 the area of â€‹â€‹your hand that covers the drill 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.120
 is about 5 centimeters what 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.890
 that we see here are potentially 170 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.090
 pressure newtons that the wick exerted 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.040
 on his neck 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.830
 the pressure would increase if the wick of the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.810
 drill was narrower the wick should 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.060
 measure approximately one centimeter 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 correct the thinner the wick 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.860
 the greater the pressure exerted so 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 in theory I could exercise more than 140 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.220
 newtons is correct could beg the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.440
 Pressure 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.050
 the data confirm that I pushed the 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.660
 drill with a pressure of 140 newtons 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.790
 it's the same as having a boxer weigh 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.770
 heavy holding the drill and it's 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.610
 enough pressure to drill the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.130
 steel 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.880
 Now drilling to your head you're ready 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.880
 and here we go 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.510
 [Music] 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:31.460
 [Music] 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.010
 once again the data confirm that jo 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.770
 push the drill with a pressure of 140 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.920
 newtons per square centimeter is 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.590
 difficult to imagine how it is possible that 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.130
 a person does this without being 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.130
 wound
