00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
there so a couple of skills to point out

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
there so a couple of skills to point out
on<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> build<00:01:20.909> our<00:01:21.150> than<00:01:21.299> improvised<00:01:21.630> kalan

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
on this build our than improvised kalan

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.749 
on this build our than improvised kalan
the<00:01:22.020> hammer<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> ring<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.070> warding<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the hammer which is ring of warding this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
the hammer which is ring of warding this
is<00:01:23.939> basically<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.479> area<00:01:24.780> denial<00:01:24.930> skill<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is basically an area denial skill or it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.890 
is basically an area denial skill or it
will<00:01:26.369> either<00:01:26.490> keep<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> area<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
will either keep you in the area if you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
will either keep you in the area if you
get<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> ring<00:01:28.290> around<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.619> person<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.100> push

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
get the ring around the person or push

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.249 
get the ring around the person or push
them<00:01:29.490> away<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.270> basically<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
them away so basically if you put this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
them away so basically if you put this
down<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> point<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.430> basically<00:01:32.700> keep

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
down over a point you can basically keep

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.359 
down over a point you can basically keep
the<00:01:33.750> enemy<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.500> point<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.040> five

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the enemy out of that point for five

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.300 
the enemy out of that point for five
seconds<00:01:35.880> really<00:01:36.530> cut<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.710> important<00:01:38.040> skills

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
seconds really cut more important skills
