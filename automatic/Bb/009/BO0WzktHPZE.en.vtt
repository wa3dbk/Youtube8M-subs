00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.989 
granite tile they're really sturdy but
we<00:00:35.809> didn't<00:00:36.050> have<00:00:36.230> enough<00:00:36.769> when<00:00:37.129> we<00:00:37.280> had<00:00:37.670> moved

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:37.999 
we didn't have enough when we had moved

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:40.720 
we didn't have enough when we had moved
the<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:39.350> stove<00:00:39.620> away<00:00:39.890> from<00:00:40.129> here<00:00:40.309> we<00:00:40.489> didn't

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
the the stove away from here we didn't

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.160 
the the stove away from here we didn't
have<00:00:40.820> enough<00:00:40.850> to<00:00:41.239> fill<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.539> whole<00:00:41.690> space<00:00:41.899> out

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
have enough to fill the whole space out

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.049 
have enough to fill the whole space out
so<00:00:42.499> instead<00:00:42.800> of<00:00:42.859> trying<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.249> match<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.850> black

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
so instead of trying to match the black

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.419 
so instead of trying to match the black
which<00:00:44.359> is<00:00:44.480> really<00:00:44.719> hard<00:00:45.019> we<00:00:45.710> found<00:00:45.920> this

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
which is really hard we found this

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:48.099 
which is really hard we found this
ground<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:46.969> that's<00:00:47.149> totally<00:00:47.569> different<00:00:47.719> but

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
ground that that's totally different but

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.930 
ground that that's totally different but
it<00:00:48.199> still<00:00:48.379> matches<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.980> black<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.460> then<00:00:49.699> we

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
it still matches the black and then we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.090 
it still matches the black and then we
tie<00:00:50.179> it<00:00:50.239> in<00:00:50.510> in<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.929> rest<00:00:51.109> of<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.289> kitchen<00:00:51.589> so
