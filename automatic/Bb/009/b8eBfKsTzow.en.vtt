the<00:00:03.300> concept<00:00:03.629> pain<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.049> about<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.380> future<00:00:04.589> so

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the concept pain is about the future so

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.860 
the concept pain is about the future so
we<00:00:05.130> try<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.339> project<00:00:05.640> ourselves<00:00:05.940> 40<00:00:06.660> years

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
we try to project ourselves 40 years

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.129 
we try to project ourselves 40 years
ahead<00:00:06.990> very<00:00:07.560> lean<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.189> blended<00:00:08.849> huge<00:00:09.330> bit<00:00:09.990> like

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
ahead very lean a blended huge bit like

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.350 
ahead very lean a blended huge bit like
a<00:00:10.170> soda<00:00:10.469> bottle<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.160> then<00:00:11.610> some<00:00:11.910> blended

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
a soda bottle and then some blended

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.240 
a soda bottle and then some blended
wings<00:00:12.570> going<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.440> order<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.710> reduce<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
wings going up in order to reduce the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.580 
wings going up in order to reduce the
drag<00:00:14.370> with<00:00:14.670> laminar<00:00:15.030> flow<00:00:15.289> mimicking<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.379> bird

drag with laminar flow mimicking a bird
in<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> way<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.220> afterwards<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> tail<00:00:18.330> two

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
in a way and afterwards the tail two

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.260 
in a way and afterwards the tail two
engines<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> V<00:00:20.039> tail<00:00:20.340> wrapped<00:00:20.820> around<00:00:21.000> the

cabinet idea is to move out of the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.710 
cabinet idea is to move out of the
old-fashioned<00:00:25.949> class<00:00:26.250> system<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:26.939> first

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
old-fashioned class system your first

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.030 
class business class economy class and
think<00:00:30.300> more<00:00:30.449> about<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> experience<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
think more about the experience so the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
think more about the experience so the
ideas<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.610> approach<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.239> plane<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.989> put

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
ideas you approach the plane you put

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.470 
ideas you approach the plane you put
your<00:00:34.380> hand<00:00:34.590> close<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> door<00:00:35.790> immediately

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
your hand close to the door immediately

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560 
your hand close to the door immediately
the<00:00:37.260> brain<00:00:37.530> recognizes<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.460> shows<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the brain recognizes you shows you to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
the brain recognizes you shows you to
all<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.930> seat<00:00:40.230> takes<00:00:40.860> care<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.370> your

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
all your seat takes care about your

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
all your seat takes care about your
luggage<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.149> then<00:00:42.600> you've<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
luggage and then you've got basically a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.549 
luggage and then you've got basically a
choice<00:00:43.800> within<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.820> smart<00:00:45.360> tech<00:00:45.600> zone<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
choice within a smart tech zone and the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.130 
choice within a smart tech zone and the
more<00:00:46.739> vitalizing<00:00:47.579> relaxing<00:00:48.030> zone<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.020> i

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
more vitalizing relaxing zone so if i

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
more vitalizing relaxing zone so if i
move<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.649> smart<00:00:49.950> tech<00:00:50.160> zone<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.940> enter

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
move to the smart tech zone you enter

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.319 
move to the smart tech zone you enter
the<00:00:51.360> zone<00:00:51.539> seat<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.620> adjustable<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> pitch<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the zone seat is adjustable in pitch and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.410 
the zone seat is adjustable in pitch and
also<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:55.050> swivel<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.070> heat<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.370> auto<00:00:56.850> moving

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
also can swivel this heat is auto moving

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
also can swivel this heat is auto moving
around<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.559> smart<00:00:58.859> material<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> then

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
around you with smart material and then

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
around you with smart material and then
also<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.320> energy<00:01:01.920> harvesting

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
also there is an energy harvesting

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.880 
also there is an energy harvesting
system<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> heat<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.870> your<00:01:03.899> body<00:01:04.049> can

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
system so that the heat of your body can

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.730 
system so that the heat of your body can
be<00:01:05.070> used<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.610> order<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> power<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.260> aircraft

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
be used in order to power the aircraft

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
be used in order to power the aircraft
like<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> cabin<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.720> forth<00:01:09.930> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
like the cabin and so on so forth and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.109 
like the cabin and so on so forth and
then<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> got<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> front<00:01:11.490> zone<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> front

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then you got the front zone the front

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
then you got the front zone the front
zone<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.450> model<00:01:12.780> axing<00:01:13.200> zone<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.920> again

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
zone is model axing zone so here again

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.240 
zone is model axing zone so here again
bio<00:01:14.939> morphing<00:01:15.570> seats<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.710> around

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
bio morphing seats but more around

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.380
