the<00:01:25.970> nice<00:01:26.970> problem<00:01:27.659> should<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:29.030> from

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the nice problem should be there from

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810 
the nice problem should be there from
coming<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.619> taking<00:01:32.369> surface

that<00:02:31.270> was<00:02:31.750> always<00:02:31.930> bothering<00:02:32.560> me<00:02:32.800> because<00:02:33.010> i

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
that was always bothering me because i

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.510 
that was always bothering me because i
touch<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.060> e<00:02:34.950> without<00:02:35.950> wanting<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.490> and

sometimes it give me problems but that's

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.510 
sometimes it give me problems but that's
not<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.690> problem<00:02:43.960> itself<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.980> problem<00:02:45.310> was

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
not the problem itself the problem was

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.540 
not the problem itself the problem was
that<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.810> option<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.410> disconnect<00:02:48.400> this

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.430 
internet no one will do it so I made my
homemade<00:02:59.610> solution<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.420> leave<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.050> right

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
homemade solution that I leave you right

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.600 
homemade solution that I leave you right
here<00:03:02.850> click<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:06.660> that's<00:03:07.660> it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
here click it and that's it

here click it and that's it
so<00:03:10.270> now<00:03:11.020> let's<00:03:11.530> make<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:12.040> introduced<00:03:12.700> test

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
so now let's make the introduced test

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.520 
so now let's make the introduced test
and<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.950> phone<00:03:15.190> has<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:16.170> result<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:19.020> 3333<00:03:20.020> k

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and this phone has a result of 3333 k

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.340 
and this phone has a result of 3333 k
point<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.730> it's<00:03:21.970> really<00:03:22.420> good<00:03:22.600> mark<00:03:23.230> for
