00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
it mimics some of the green mass that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.979 
it mimics some of the green mass that
you<00:01:00.899> see<00:01:01.199> underneath<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.399> ocean<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> way

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
you see underneath the ocean so the way

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
you see underneath the ocean so the way
I'm<00:01:04.110> doing<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.530> design<00:01:04.769> today<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.479> part

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I'm doing this design today is the part

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.080 
I'm doing this design today is the part
that's<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> base<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that's here on the base this is going to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's here on the base this is going to
be<00:01:09.210> under<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> water<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
be under the water and so I'm going to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.950 
be under the water and so I'm going to
have<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.920> underwater<00:01:11.460> themes<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.840> why

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
have some underwater themes which is why

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
have some underwater themes which is why
I'm<00:01:13.080> using<00:01:13.110> succulents<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.250> think

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I'm using succulents because I think

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
I'm using succulents because I think
succulents<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.869> lend<00:01:16.110> themselves<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
succulents really lend themselves to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.960 
succulents really lend themselves to
looking<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.130> underwater<00:01:17.880> plants<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> I'm

going to look at some of our succulents

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
going to look at some of our succulents
these<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.000> brought<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.450> various<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
these are brought to various and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
these are brought to various and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
secondly the stems are really short and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
secondly the stems are really short and
so<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.659> give<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:45.990> extra<00:01:46.350> girth<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so they give it a little extra girth I'm

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
so they give it a little extra girth I'm
gonna<00:01:47.490> add<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.000> stub<00:01:48.329> wire<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:49.470> into<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
gonna add a stub wire right into the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
gonna add a stub wire right into the
base<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> stem<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.200> allow<00:01:52.470> me

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
base of the stem and that will allow me

this coral and the one thing that's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.229 
this coral and the one thing that's
great<00:02:25.319> about<00:02:25.349> succulents<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:27.120> don't

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
great about succulents is they don't

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.660 
great about succulents is they don't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and of my design I think that it adds an

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.160 
and of my design I think that it adds an
so<00:03:48.640> sea<00:03:49.030> creature<00:03:49.500> touch<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> design<00:03:52.170> okay

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so sea creature touch to the design okay

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.780 
so sea creature touch to the design okay

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
here I'm going to take these beautiful

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.000 
here I'm going to take these beautiful
Brazilian<00:04:01.900> berries<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.470> got<00:04:02.680> today<00:04:02.890> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
Brazilian berries that I got today and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.740 
Brazilian berries that I got today and
finish<00:04:03.549> covering<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.060> rest<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.510> phone

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
finish covering the rest of the phone

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.099 
finish covering the rest of the phone
and<00:04:05.439> I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.220> these<00:04:06.579> again<00:04:07.180> mimic<00:04:07.840> an

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
and I think that these again mimic an

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.759 
and I think that these again mimic an
underwater<00:04:08.620> sea<00:04:09.159> plant<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:10.439> finally<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:11.470> have

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
underwater sea plant and finally I have

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.530 
underwater sea plant and finally I have
to<00:04:11.799> do<00:04:12.040> something<00:04:12.400> with<00:04:12.579> this<00:04:12.760> tall<00:04:13.060> baby<00:04:13.299> so

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
to do something with this tall baby so

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.970 
to do something with this tall baby so
don't<00:04:13.629> just<00:04:14.019> leave<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.349> empty<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.829> is<00:04:14.950> a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
don't just leave it empty it is a

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.580 
don't just leave it empty it is a
beautiful<00:04:15.459> base<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:16.030> its<00:04:16.150> own<00:04:16.359> but<00:04:17.139> I<00:04:17.199> do<00:04:17.320> want

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
beautiful base on its own but I do want

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
some other plume grass that I picked up

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.810 
some other plume grass that I picked up
this<00:04:35.919> morning<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:37.590> place<00:04:38.590> those<00:04:38.949> around<00:04:39.280> just

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
this morning and place those around just

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.839 
this morning and place those around just
a<00:04:39.910> loose<00:04:40.150> beachy<00:04:40.780> kind<00:04:41.349> of<00:04:41.440> design<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.220> then

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
a loose beachy kind of design and then

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.450 
a loose beachy kind of design and then
finally<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.570> Pyrrhus<00:04:44.050> japonica<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.430> I

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
finally this Pyrrhus japonica that I

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.430 
finally this Pyrrhus japonica that I
also<00:04:45.699> picked<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.389> at<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.720> Ash<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.050> morning

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
also picked up at the Ash this morning

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.020 
also picked up at the Ash this morning
that<00:04:48.099> is<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:48.669> pretty

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
that is so pretty

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.800 
that is so pretty
and<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.840> think<00:04:49.900> really<00:04:50.320> lends<00:04:50.770> itself<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
and I think really lends itself to this

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.640 
and I think really lends itself to this
design<00:04:53.289> so<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:55.330> hope<00:04:55.599> that<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.960> enjoyed<00:04:56.320> my
