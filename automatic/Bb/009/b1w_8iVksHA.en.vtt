00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.040
 so start shooting with us, ours works 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.590
 physical laboratory 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:20.500
 Our experiment today is dedicated to 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:23.830
 what is the usual testicle here, look girls 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:29.619
 a lot of eggs count we will not be 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:33.820
 but they don't usually multiply everything by 6 and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.090
 how much it will not know it will be 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.270
 much the matter is not the point is that our 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:46.270
 with you the eggs are not the same here and there 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:49.449
 raw eggs and boiled eggs so well done 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.660
 oksanka already know let's just then 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.019
 this and let's do it I specially cooked 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.109
 you two eggs boiled here 2 boiled eggs 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.410
 all other raw i want you 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.370
 Now found such of these eggs var and 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.800
 wave your wands 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.700
 cheers waved magic wands and 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.820
 let's search 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.750
 boiled eggs but we will not be for this their 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.970
 break we will take and what to do 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 twist put your magic wand 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.240
 on the floor lay an egg on the table and in fact 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.070
 route wait let's see just 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:34.860
 she will make it raw probably back 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 it to your fret now you cool choose 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.770
 see slowly spinning raw let's 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.400
 raw and as a sample leave here 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.830
 put his sphere here his face put 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.590
 look there i'm trying to rotate she doesn't 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.280
 spins badly spins life 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 screaming venetianov so come on 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.469
 roll it 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:05.350
 about death is valued so oksana found one 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:10.090
 boiled eggs let's look for the second not 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:15.730
 spins on 4 then which egg is not boiled 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:18.519
 spinning like this watch and raw 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
 spinning differently this is your raw 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:27.730
 Eggs do not fidget see another look 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.720
 boiled egg what's Masha Masha axon 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.720
 You have already found one 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:44.620
 this is what well, let's go one you found the bodies 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.709
 like we have boiled eggs so let's get it 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.720
 check and suddenly it's not true let's 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.540
 take this egg yes and we split it 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.040
 ready and suddenly it is liquid then what 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.560
 happen spread for this we take 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.549
 this one here is a plate and this one here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 a plate break his hold its smear 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:19.269
 hold on come on 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:21.340
 some egg boiled or raw and we 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.450
 you correctly found it boiled 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 it's like he and you egg too military so 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.829
 maybe they are all boiled here 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.560
 check choose some testicle 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.450
 check how it turns 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.549
 check so slowly spinning if 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.260
 slowly spinning is what kind of egg is raw 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.329
 let's break it down and check it out 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.230
 really but raw or not who will 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:52.690
 keep it like this on your palm and putting here 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:04:01.010
 so put a second egg on your palm 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:03.590
 check the same egg is raw because 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.890
 that a raw egg rotates slowly 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.069
 correct so you three pens in 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.989
 napkin thus rotating yulechke 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.090
 can distinguish raw egg and boiled 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.630
 remember let's try now 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.990
 explain why the boiled egg is spinning 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.350
 different than raw egg we have two 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.660
 jars one ice bottle see ice 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.169
 there is 2 a jar of vodichka here it is with 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.720
 bath 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.660
 in this open we'll see but here we have 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.090
 ice frozen water frozen water 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.970
 it symbolizes a boiled egg because 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.060
 what 's solid but here's a jar 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.870
 She with a little water Vodichka symbolizes 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.660
 raw egg and now look if we 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.020
 throw the thing that he told 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.400
 just thats all yes and what happens to 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.919
 the subject which the liquid he rocks he 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.010
 therefore resists 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.979
 liquid matter liquid egg behaves 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.880
 differently but a solid at all 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.310
 differently and liquid about and stops 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.639
 see you right away i'm pushing the liquid 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.530
 plays and stops it happens 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.280
 due to inertia 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:25.729
 solid and liquid body it is different and 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:29.180
 you see the solid inertia of these faster 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.970
 substances she was different you were interested 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.530
 today there is still no need to break 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.040
 twist can not be broken 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.560
 ok mother 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.740
 correctly counted multiplication tables 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.810
 trick 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.060
 all guys subscribe to our 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.970
 the physical channel is our next 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:06:01.090
 the experiment will be very interesting and he 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:04.150
 will be devoted to the testicle again until all 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.570
 need to think that everything will cost now 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:10.410
 I will surely demand everything badly 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.410
 will turn over 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.310
 all that fields of fire 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.289
 of 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.760
 all that concerns the language 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.270
 his faces are different 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.270
