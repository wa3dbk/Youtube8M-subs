00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 we are here on a samsung event 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.000
 and here two devices were presented 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.680
 We first put that one before what 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 here in europe content you should the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 get focus and that it is six e 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.670
 plus the plus is not tendered 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 but hanged as a plus sign and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.130
 that's what I think in my hand 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.260
 the smaller brother content has that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 unlike the women singles 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 now 57 inches is of course essential 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.380
 bigger all other technical data 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.369
 are almost identical except for the internal ones 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.440
 Memory is the frame of the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 namely on 4 gb others grow and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 camera, of course I have everything the same 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.050
 I stayed on the camera 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.270
 back this is a 16 megapixel 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 camera and a 5 megapixel front camera 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.989
 on the front and the display 5.7 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.809
 inch also rico hd capable and of course 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 the edges are here also by that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.350
 it has not gotten bigger 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 you also do a little bit more here 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.969
 when you see the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.909
 try the motto, there you see 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.409
 Here are all these people you can 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.240
 then you can prove that free 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 stop phone call or just run 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 hold these other things as well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.860
 we were shown how to do it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 namely even video live broadcast 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.439
 content can send messages and such 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.990
 on and on 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.729
 the video broadcast feature is in the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580
 Camera integrated here you can then 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 also in the profi konz send if 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.240
 the user also has one 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.189
 Samsung Galaxy Tab sextets or plus 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.100
 or maybe an ass six 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.320
 Everything has more content 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 actually almost identical except for the 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.680
 internal memory of four 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.729
 gigawatt has grown and of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.390
 size, of course, a bit too 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 got bigger and it with 153 grams 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 you can also with the app too 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.189
 because with applications now that is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.960
 lay down 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.880
 Here you can easily select and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.210
 then the director jumps and you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 can 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.770
 all the applications on the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.790
 installed device than as a kind of 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.060
 has shortcut on the corner next to it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.080
 you can only try 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.909
 and then here and namely the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.490
 be stored cloud drive 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.530
 that is also there and yes 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.850
 as far as actually more or less too 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.730
 the samsung galaxy s 6 + cats what me 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 Striking is in the rest of Asia nachgucken 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.800
 snyder is there too 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.209
 on top of this card slot and what 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.330
 still important you can not see 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.320
 on the back the charge because it 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.700
 clear that so that can be your battery 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.670
 I charge much faster 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.989
 I think that was about 120 minutes 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.940
 wireless charging then the complete one 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.040
 Discharge fully charged when the cable 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.230
 all are 90 minutes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.550
 this is a youth further improvement 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.320
 opposite the s6 and the s6 she needs 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.010
 a bit longer while loading with 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.680
 cable and also wireless and needs it 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.519
 But you also have a charger that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.049
 then this six plus it fell but that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.600
 then more or less supported 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.700
 Cost to pay is then not something 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.010
 this is not compatible with 16 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.630
 because that is in a function or 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.000
 better that can only feature what it is 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.980
 Six plus will get over the prices 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.260
 still currently silent 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.420
 a bit out but should also be in the state 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.549
 August in the city ​​helps with us in 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.410
 europe and then we'll have a look 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.549
 yet another one gets is 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.549
 not that good 5
