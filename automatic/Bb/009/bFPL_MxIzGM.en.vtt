00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends with you alexey and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
 today I want to show you another 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.010
 Parcel from China is such a small 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.980
 the package is literally me 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.070
 arrived today and in her idea 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.050
 samsung batteries 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.640
 Now we open it look at read 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.100
 I ordered branded batteries 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 samsung 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.510
 here is the standard 18 650 for this one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 powerbank that's when if you watched 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 My review of this accessory I am in it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.340
 told me that if you order good 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.879
 batteries with a capacity of 2600 milliampere hours 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.829
 then we basically get for small 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.750
 relatively money in a very 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 not bad for the orban itself that I and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.870
 decided to do and in theory here here 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.789
 These batteries here , but now we 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.180
 open and see means open 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 the parcel is indicated here labeled its 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 cost like 19 dollars so they 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 are the only thing that is the Swedes 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 I had to post or a dollar or 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.110
 what is to pay extra for mail that is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.290
 david for shipping 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.049
 actually packed with this 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:27.350
 batteries 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.350
 open plenochku we remove it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:44.640

 f says it's 2600 milliamps 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:12.610
 hours, in principle, what I ordered 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:16.390
 they are such as we see each 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.640
 the battery is very packed 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.630
 carefully and carefully and in principle I think 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:28.520
 that their quality matches because 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.340
 the seller lot is described exactly 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.200

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.580
 I will show how it looks in the unpacked 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.580
 form here 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.860
 these are like this 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.920
 four unpack means what are they for 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.709
 generally needed then see 2600 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.909
 milliampere hours 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.069
 Price 19 bucks well plus add a couple 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:32.590
 dollars delivery per dollar than let 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:37.120
 there will be 2121 dollars for 21 dollars we 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.049
 we get 10,000 milliampere hours well there 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.519
 a little more turns out actually 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:48.430
 10400 if you count here but no matter how 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.180
 will there be such a capacity due under 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.250
 business is the most powerbank and on various there 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.010
 I do not know where the general energy goes 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.750
 right when converting probably well 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:11.949
 about 10,000 I hope that is, we 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:15.340
 we get powerbank 10,000 milliamps 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:18.130
 In a matter of hours, that's 19 for this thing 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.699
 my 10 something like that that is 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.750
 it turns out $ 30 here 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.060
 then where do we set it up 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 that's the way 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.970
 click remove powerbank here for me 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.190
 mean now 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:43.659
 Chinese some are low-grade 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:47.580
 remove them throw them in principle not 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:51.210
 needed and set purely for the test and 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.210
 set here the third 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.039
 1 here we have lit up and 2 batteries 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.240
 original top quality how would 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:07.840
 well samsung quality so i think everything 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.909
 it will work fine here we press 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.560
 to show that they are tired of the heart 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.039
 not charged need to charge 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.310
 of course 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.310
 here and after that it will be quite possible 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.909
 charge smartphones in principle 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:31.770
 any here such here it is for 3 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:36.270

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.610
 look more review link in the form of here 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.400

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:47.120
 order yourself also such a set 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.120
