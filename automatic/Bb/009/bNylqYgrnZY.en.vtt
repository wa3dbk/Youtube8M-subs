00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this just explains forty and here is the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.190 
this just explains forty and here is the
other<00:01:27.720> side<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.890> showing<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.360> 40

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
other side where it's showing the 40

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
other side where it's showing the 40
bottom<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.250> said<00:01:32.430> before<00:01:32.520> has<00:01:32.850> wide<00:01:33.090> ball

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bottom like I said before has wide ball

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.240 
bottom like I said before has wide ball
sharp<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.909> flat<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.450> back<00:01:40.189> so<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
sharp and flat here is the back so it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.819 
sharp and flat here is the back so it
only<00:01:41.340> comes<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.700> three<00:01:41.880> parts<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.540> face<00:01:42.829> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
only comes with three parts the face the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.810 
only comes with three parts the face the
40<00:01:44.369> metal<00:01:44.670> wheel<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:46.439> 40<00:01:46.740> bottom<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
40 metal wheel and the 40 bottom and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.359 
40 metal wheel and the 40 bottom and
yeah

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.770 

I<00:01:54.399> guess<00:01:55.149> there<00:01:55.329> are<00:01:55.390> two<00:01:55.450> modes<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
I guess there are two modes to it I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.410 
I guess there are two modes to it I
believe<00:02:00.929> when<00:02:01.929> you<00:02:02.490> spin<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:03.880> one<00:02:04.210> mode

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
believe when you spin it it's one mode

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.419 
believe when you spin it it's one mode
and<00:02:04.659> once<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.079> loses<00:02:05.229> spin<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.920> becomes

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
and once it loses spin it becomes

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.540 
and once it loses spin it becomes
another<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:08.110> think<00:02:08.739> it's<00:02:08.890> from<00:02:09.160> attack<00:02:09.519> to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
another I think it's from attack to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.770 
another I think it's from attack to
defense<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:12.099> will<00:02:12.610> check<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.150> out<00:02:13.420> later

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
defense but I will check that out later

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.860 
defense but I will check that out later
and<00:02:15.330> suggest<00:02:16.330> combo<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.310> about<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.870> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
and suggest combo and that's about it so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:30.059 
and suggest combo and that's about it so
let's<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:20.349> get<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.069> unboxing

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.480

okay so um
here's<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> beyblade<00:02:41.800> got<00:02:42.580> aside<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.090> now

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
here's the beyblade got aside for now

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:55.140 
here's the beyblade got aside for now
instructions<00:02:46.200> stickers<00:02:49.080> very<00:02:50.080> Aries<00:02:54.150> and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
instructions stickers very Aries and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.890 
instructions stickers very Aries and
let's<00:02:55.420> go<00:02:55.660> over<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.230> light<00:02:56.530> launcher<00:02:56.980> first

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
let's go over the light launcher first

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.690 
let's go over the light launcher first
all<00:02:58.900> right<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.970> sees<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:01.590> our<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:03.519> means

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
all right so it sees as our that means

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.820 
all right so it sees as our that means
these<00:03:04.000> are<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.540> right<00:03:05.610> right<00:03:06.610> spin<00:03:06.910> prongs

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
these are the right right spin prongs

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.160 
these are the right right spin prongs
and<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:11.170> see<00:03:11.349> right<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.049> to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and you see right here you have to

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.330 
and you see right here you have to
switch<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:15.630> pro<00:03:16.630> no<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:17.380> was<00:03:17.470> right<00:03:17.560> so

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
switch it to pro no that was right so

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.860 
switch it to pro no that was right so
there's<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:18.940> switch<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.269> blocks

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
there's this little switch that blocks

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.449 
there's this little switch that blocks
the<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.690> holes<00:03:22.959> where<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.440> put<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.130> rip<00:03:24.280> cord

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
the the holes where you put the rip cord

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.110 
the the holes where you put the rip cord
in<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.269> right<00:03:25.420> now<00:03:25.599> it's<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.260> right<00:03:26.470> spin<00:03:27.120> and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
in so right now it's the right spin and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.550 
in so right now it's the right spin and
you<00:03:28.209> just<00:03:28.390> put<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:29.700> nope<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.959> spins<00:03:32.290> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
you just put it in nope and it spins to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.009 
you just put it in nope and it spins to
the<00:03:32.590> right<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.730> feels<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:34.330> grinding

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the right and it feels really grinding

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.870 
the right and it feels really grinding
right<00:03:35.200> now<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.680> because<00:03:36.160> it's<00:03:36.340> kind<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.730> new

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
right now so because it's kind of new

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.780 
right now so because it's kind of new
I'm<00:03:37.269> pretty<00:03:37.780> sure<00:03:37.900> if<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.110> keep<00:03:38.290> using<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.790> it'll

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
I'm pretty sure if I keep using it it'll

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.539 
I'm pretty sure if I keep using it it'll
be<00:03:40.049> okay

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
be okay

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.550 
be okay
right<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.880> want<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.090> go<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.360> left<00:03:44.140> you

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
right so if you want to go to left you

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.580 
right so if you want to go to left you
just<00:03:44.590> push<00:03:45.549> this<00:03:45.760> over<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.450> see<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
just push this over and see that it

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.670 
just push this over and see that it
blocks<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.220> right<00:03:48.549> hole<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.049> opens<00:03:50.590> up

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
blocks the right hole and it opens up

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.259 
blocks the right hole and it opens up
the<00:03:50.829> left<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:52.390> take<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.109> prongs<00:03:53.500> out<00:03:54.269> see

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
the left and you take the prongs out see

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:05.039 
the left and you take the prongs out see
how<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.660> do<00:03:56.049> this<00:03:57.540> mmm<00:03:59.310> there<00:04:00.310> goes<00:04:03.989> so<00:04:04.989> you

aside<00:05:03.570> right<00:05:04.410> now<00:05:05.510> finally<00:05:06.510> on<00:05:06.630> some<00:05:06.840> beyblade

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
aside right now finally on some beyblade

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:17.470 
aside right now finally on some beyblade
here<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:09.470> 40<00:05:10.470> face<00:05:10.650> bolt<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.950> dark<00:05:14.310> gray

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.410 

pearly<00:05:18.480> color<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:21.630> here<00:05:22.230> is<00:05:22.440> very<00:05:23.250> Aries<00:05:23.760> it's

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
pearly color and here is very Aries it's

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.310 
pearly color and here is very Aries it's
really<00:05:24.810> heavy

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
really heavy

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:34.640 
really heavy
by<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.650> way<00:05:30.350> alright<00:05:31.350> so<00:05:31.710> um<00:05:32.100> once<00:05:32.990> when<00:05:33.990> you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
by the way alright so um once when you

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.350 
by the way alright so um once when you
spin<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.280> beyblade<00:05:35.490> when<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.910> first<00:05:36.150> spin

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
spin the beyblade when you first spin

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.770 
spin the beyblade when you first spin
the<00:05:36.450> beyblade<00:05:36.660> it's<00:05:37.620> an<00:05:37.770> attack<00:05:38.100> mode<00:05:38.780> so

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
the beyblade it's an attack mode so

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.490 
the beyblade it's an attack mode so
these<00:05:40.200> little<00:05:40.620> things<00:05:41.040> will<00:05:41.400> come<00:05:41.730> out<00:05:41.880> or<00:05:42.500> go

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
these little things will come out or go

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.610 
these little things will come out or go
in<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:44.070> once<00:05:44.550> it<00:05:44.700> loses<00:05:44.790> spin<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.510> comes<00:05:46.380> out

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
in and once it loses spin it comes out

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.860 
in and once it loses spin it comes out
and<00:05:46.830> becomes<00:05:47.160> defense<00:05:47.700> mode<00:05:47.970> I<00:05:48.180> believe<00:05:48.570> I

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and becomes defense mode I believe I

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.580 
and becomes defense mode I believe I
think<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:49.830> is<00:05:50.150> not<00:05:51.150> sure<00:05:51.360> but<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:52.200> wouldn't

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
think it is not sure but that wouldn't

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.420 
think it is not sure but that wouldn't
make<00:05:52.860> more<00:05:53.370> sense<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.760> me<00:05:54.620> so<00:05:55.620> very<00:05:55.860> Aries<00:05:56.280> is

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
make more sense to me so very Aries is

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.510 
make more sense to me so very Aries is
actually<00:05:56.910> really<00:05:57.120> good<00:05:57.360> attack<00:05:57.690> wheel<00:05:57.900> if<00:05:58.770> you

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
actually really good attack wheel if you

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.290 
actually really good attack wheel if you
pair<00:05:59.760> it<00:05:59.790> up<00:05:59.940> with<00:06:00.000> our<00:06:00.240> 145<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.670> our<00:06:02.670> F<00:06:02.940> or

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
pair it up with our 145 and our F or

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.100 
pair it up with our 145 and our F or
right<00:06:03.980> rubber<00:06:04.980> flat<00:06:05.400> or<00:06:06.060> anything<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:07.050> that
