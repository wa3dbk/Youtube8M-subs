story into it it's I think where the
world<00:05:58.250> is<00:05:58.460> controlled<00:05:58.970> by<00:05:59.180> like<00:05:59.479> computers

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
world is controlled by like computers

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.430 
world is controlled by like computers
not<00:06:00.350> by<00:06:00.560> you<00:06:01.220> and<00:06:01.400> then<00:06:01.550> this<00:06:01.729> guy<00:06:02.020> broke<00:06:03.020> free
