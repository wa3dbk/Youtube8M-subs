sciatic pain especially when driving and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.790 
sciatic pain especially when driving and
part<00:00:19.520> of<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:19.730> is<00:00:19.939> due<00:00:19.970> to<00:00:20.210> what<00:00:21.109> their<00:00:21.350> the

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
part of this is due to what their the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.380 
part of this is due to what their the
position<00:00:22.250> that<00:00:22.400> the<00:00:22.490> body<00:00:22.699> is<00:00:22.850> in<00:00:23.000> before<00:00:23.300> they

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
position that the body is in before they

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.349 
position that the body is in before they
even<00:00:23.510> get<00:00:23.750> into<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.080> car<00:00:24.350> but<00:00:25.279> another<00:00:25.730> reason

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
even get into the car but another reason

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.880 
even get into the car but another reason
that<00:00:26.510> this<00:00:26.689> is<00:00:26.750> happening<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.410> because<00:00:27.529> the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
that this is happening is because the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.939 
that this is happening is because the
roads<00:00:28.130> are<00:00:28.369> sloped<00:00:28.789> somewhat<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.170> one<00:00:30.439> angle

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
roads are sloped somewhat and one angle

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.430 
roads are sloped somewhat and one angle
or<00:00:31.130> another<00:00:31.400> that<00:00:31.609> can<00:00:32.150> affect<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.660> back<00:00:33.050> and

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
or another that can affect the back and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the things that I like to try out with a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.829 
the things that I like to try out with a
lot<00:00:43.820> of<00:00:43.909> my<00:00:44.000> patients<00:00:44.210> when<00:00:44.540> they're<00:00:44.629> driving

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
lot of my patients when they're driving

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.539 
lot of my patients when they're driving
is<00:00:45.199> we<00:00:45.350> just<00:00:45.470> put<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.739> cushion<00:00:46.280> or<00:00:46.370> two

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:46.549 
is we just put a cushion or two

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:49.719 
is we just put a cushion or two
underneath<00:00:47.330> one<00:00:47.629> of<00:00:47.659> the<00:00:47.869> hips<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:48.610> when<00:00:49.610> we

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
underneath one of the hips and when we

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.380 
underneath one of the hips and when we
do<00:00:49.909> this<00:00:50.150> it<00:00:50.510> lifts<00:00:51.199> that<00:00:51.320> hip<00:00:51.619> up<00:00:51.830> and<00:00:52.390> can

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
do this it lifts that hip up and can

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.600 
do this it lifts that hip up and can
create<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> lot<00:00:54.470> of<00:00:54.559> relief<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.369> lot<00:00:55.519> of

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
create a lot of relief and a lot of

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.820 
create a lot of relief and a lot of
times<00:00:55.820> that<00:00:56.000> relief<00:00:56.299> is<00:00:56.479> because<00:00:56.869> when<00:00:57.650> this

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
times that relief is because when this

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.189 
times that relief is because when this
hip<00:00:58.070> is<00:00:58.250> elevated<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.059> shortens<00:00:59.960> these

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
hip is elevated it shortens these

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.829 
hip is elevated it shortens these
muscles<00:01:00.739> here<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.040> allows<00:01:01.580> these<00:01:02.059> muscles<00:01:02.689> to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
muscles here and allows these muscles to

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.570 
muscles here and allows these muscles to
relax<00:01:03.140> if<00:01:03.500> these<00:01:03.799> are<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.040> muscles<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.400> are

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
relax if these are the muscles that are

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.090 
relax if these are the muscles that are
the<00:01:04.729> problem<00:01:04.939> causing<00:01:05.570> your<00:01:05.630> pain<00:01:05.869> now<00:01:06.650> what

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the problem causing your pain now what

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.280 
the problem causing your pain now what
they<00:01:07.190> do<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.550> other<00:01:07.730> side<00:01:08.000> is<00:01:08.300> when<00:01:09.140> this

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
they do to the other side is when this

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.390 
they do to the other side is when this
hip<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:10.930> elevated<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.350> hip<00:01:12.650> generally<00:01:13.250> goes

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
hip is elevated this hip generally goes

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.430 
hip is elevated this hip generally goes
down<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.420> waist<00:01:14.660> here<00:01:15.020> becomes

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
down and so the waist here becomes

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.340 
down and so the waist here becomes
lengthened<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.700> create<00:01:17.390> resting

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
lengthened so you create resting

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.800 
lengthened so you create resting
shortening<00:01:19.310> on<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.610> side<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.480> create

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
shortening on this side and you create

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.290 
shortening on this side and you create
lengthening<00:01:21.320> on<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:21.830> side<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.670> depending<00:01:23.240> on

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
lengthening on this side so depending on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.570 
lengthening on this side so depending on
what<00:01:23.510> is<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:24.050> source<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.890> your<00:01:25.100> issues<00:01:25.550> with

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
what is the source of your issues with

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.330 
what is the source of your issues with
causing<00:01:26.360> your<00:01:26.480> back<00:01:26.630> or<00:01:26.870> sciatic<00:01:27.260> pain<00:01:27.340> when

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
causing your back or sciatic pain when

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.610 
causing your back or sciatic pain when
you're<00:01:28.460> sitting<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:29.180> can<00:01:29.420> help<00:01:29.660> balance<00:01:30.320> a

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
you're sitting this can help balance a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.930 
you're sitting this can help balance a
lot<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.860> things<00:01:31.070> for<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.520> shut<00:01:31.730> some

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
lot of things for you and shut some

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.430 
lot of things for you and shut some
muscles<00:01:32.270> off<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.570> may<00:01:32.690> be<00:01:32.750> causing<00:01:33.230> some

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
muscles off that may be causing some

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.710 
muscles off that may be causing some
trouble<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.820> can<00:01:34.970> experiment<00:01:35.300> with<00:01:35.450> this

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
trouble so you can experiment with this

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.140 
trouble so you can experiment with this
just<00:01:36.530> play<00:01:37.070> around<00:01:37.250> with<00:01:37.400> one<00:01:37.610> side<00:01:37.820> or<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
just play around with one side or the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.080 
just play around with one side or the
other<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:39.440> how<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.800> works<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.909> it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
other and see how that works for you it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.370 
other and see how that works for you it
seems<00:01:41.330> to<00:01:41.420> work<00:01:41.450> well<00:01:41.690> for<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.990> lot<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.170> my

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
seems to work well for a lot of my
