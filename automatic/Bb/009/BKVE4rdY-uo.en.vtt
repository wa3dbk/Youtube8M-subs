00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.350
 not only has the highlight of the time mark the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 debut of the first application for 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.510
 windows phone 8 we bring to this 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.730
 column let's talk about nokia here 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.259
 Dylan says that the application you will 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.860
 enjoy exactly the situation that 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.720
 We are now when you are on the street. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.820
 it is an application you can see of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 simple interface but whose 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 great balcony to combine camera and the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 geolocation information to bring 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.670
 this augmented reality experience 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 that I marked some places to eat 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.429
 restaurant etc 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.949
 you see it picks up information from the 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.329
 map where you just have to listen to the camera 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.640
 that he shows what goes in that direction 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 He already enjoys is based mine. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 placement in locations that are 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 then most of the sites 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.109
 You can see that it will not be too long. 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.609
 farther than 300 meters that is me 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 Can I go there walking if I do? 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.480
 from here and then choose a place you 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.960
 you can also find more information 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.960
 about it 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.220
 is to bring information there as a phone 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.869
 the map and so in spite of being well 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.479
 next it will also have options of 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.090
 get direction then if I want you 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.860
 I need to drive there too. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.360
 to use but are generally good places 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.009
 then it's very good when you 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.920
 is on the street and needs to find some 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:38.350
 next thing you do not even catch a bus 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.110
 the man who ran up there so he is 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.270
 has this separation by categories you 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.569
 You can search for prices of places here 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.210
 going a great pleasure shopping accommodation 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.780
 restaurants and the other function he has 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 it's the search 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 so you can search for a place 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.100
 specific 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.159
 it will bring that same experience 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 will open that street image as we 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.440
 You're going to turn the camera and he 'll get it. 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.659
 and show you where that is 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.950
 the place he finished loading you 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.500
 has a role that I have sought here and enough 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 you download it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 you see that it changes the map mode 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.470
 so now I'm spinning and I can see 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.970
 the location that I searched on the map is 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 the same experience that we have 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.519
 when you search for categories and keep 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.620
 downloaded and shows the image of the map where 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.739
 I'm just lifting him and changing 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.109
 back to showing her that impression 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.359
