00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.000
 perplexed as far as i can understand i am 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910
 delighted 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 Walter as a man who knows 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.130
 performer of this song personally what are you 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.990
 I think no, I sang very good 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.200
 like this guy we are just such 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:44.600
 We are looking everywhere in America such young 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.210
 who have atomism and the notion of killing 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.910
 with wine glass style 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.100
 it is not easy to find so it is very 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.710
 well the Walter you were looking for in America and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.190
 found in Moscow I found in Moscow I say 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.610
 then up to the genre 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.060
 but for now I will abstain completely and 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.340
 absolutely touched Yuri mikhalych me too 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.050
 abstain in giving back wanted to become 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.960
 inspected the audience hall there at all 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.210
 another atmosphere at all we sometimes need 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.820
 go up there and watch the hall 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.970
 how do you all this all that happened on 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.970
 the stage 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.390
 I honestly do not understand this screams 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.120
 approved or vice versa, I 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:33.170
 Grisha is this that screams from this is a delight 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.970
 this is success with gentlemen mentors someone 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.380
 There is opinion about speech 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.010
 He is super and I think that this is exactly 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.890
 the very thing that we are looking for here look again that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.720
 same situation yuri mihailovich and jean 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.910

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.420
 Maxim Fadeev 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.239
 I just liked it very much 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.209
 Sergey, let's hear your opinion 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.209
 while yuriy mihilovich jean is thinking a 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.320
 I somehow do not really like this 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 that's why I say no and what not and I 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.410
 I do not know before 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.250
 like when i was small we had it 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.910
 it was called there to sing for 20 there to sing under 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.690
 gelona 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.690
 Well, in general, it is much better guys Perry 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.820
 Well, now I have not convinced you not 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.380
 forget that this man is 17 years old 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.970
 confused it was visible he started 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.810
 well in the middle of the song what is there 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.760
 it happened but I am personally ready but for 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.910
 Unfortunately, he is already going to Maxim 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.000
 I understand it's not going anywhere else 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.510
 she suddenly i'm absolutely for and megre 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.940
 okay 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.990
 no no anton katino we are looking for cases 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.930
 confused 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:01.640
 he has anxiety and others what's there 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:05.210
 sedona have a lot of the moment with you ready 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:15.020
 there were a lot of notes here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:16.310
 time did not say this but I do not take on 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.800
 responsibility to speak for all well 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.900
 personally for me in this situation i can 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.890
 forgive it because it seems to me that 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.460
 there is talent well enough here is another jury 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.199
 court replace son 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.690
 Canadian and I'm not telling you to change 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.289
 opinion I'm just trying my Well 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.710
 I think it's this guy 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.500
 definitely need to pass on 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.410
 just jean 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.020
 works and then we say no or 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.169
 Mihalych also not, too, there are no three members 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.789
 the jury said no Volter Afanasyev said 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:59.340
 yes if someone from mentors i'm right 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.340
 veto his pass on
