 weight sought a general practitioner and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.420
 blood test and ultrasound was 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.580
 detected hyperthyroidism after 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 I looked for a neck doctor . 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.189
 head to mark surgery 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.250
 the diagnosis of some normality in the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.550
 Thyroid it can be done with frame 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.920
 clinic then a health post the person 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 already begins to suspect 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960
 change in thyroid from a black doctor 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.690
 he takes a physical exam 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 this does not stop people from becoming 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.219
 save to see if you have a lump you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.850
 has a volumetric increase of the tiger 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 against 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.500
 different from what many people think 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.140
 Surgery is quiet and as soon as possible for 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 will be more satisfactory. 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 results 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.140
 a 24-hour procedure was already in the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 my house is able to do everything 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.830
 carry weight a quiet home 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 also 15 days at home after a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.400
 back with doctors and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.479
 neck and head with medicine 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 constantly taking exams 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.479
 regularly every six months 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.640
 the stroke once a year surgery is not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 painful because we do about 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 general anesthesia 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.280
 the postoperative you may have some 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.930
 type of pain 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.470
 thyroid surgery in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.790
 a few surgical indications 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.250
 first is a cancer 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.530
 the second suspected cancer is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.600
 transferred the signs of understanding in the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.229
 trachea in the esophagus or some other 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.369
 structure is adjacent to the thyroid 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 the fourth is when the tumor of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.340
 thyroid gland falls increased pro 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.050
 chest and is called a diving business. 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.190
 fifth is when you have an indication 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.650
 aesthetics 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.960
 according to US data for every 100 thousand 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.160
 20 thousand people have hyper or 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 hypothyroidism 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.590
 approximately 70% of the population 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.959
 40 and 70 presents the populace 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.070
 have some thyroid disorder 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.270
 Thyroid gland is an endocrine gland that 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.020
 is located in front of the trachea that 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.790
 has several metabolic functions and that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.760
 releases some hormones that are vital 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.040
 for the human organism to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.020
 understand better the doctor andrÃ© rodrigues 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 explains how the gland of the 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.180
 is here schematically 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.780
 trying to copy a body segment 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.480
 human 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.090
 we have the trachea and on top of it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.060
 has the larynx is an organ that people 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 can make the training talk so 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.320
 front of the trachea 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.570
 there is a thyroid here schematically 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.640
 normal thyroid this here is a disease 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.950
 that is an aunt edite where we perceive 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.019
 volumetric moment is sometimes modular 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.430
 of the thyroid gland that causes a lot of pain 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:12.290
 this is the diffuse goiter that is a 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 which is called hyperthyroidism 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.930
 it grows in a very global and 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.930
 has an acceleration 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.880
 demons thyroid and this one is a 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.450
 instinct tainting a thyroid module 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.980
 malignant has a way line a gland 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.470
 theoretically normal 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.990
 these modules we can save them 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.450
 above 1 centimeter below 1 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.840
 centimeter are diagnosed by a 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 ultrasound
