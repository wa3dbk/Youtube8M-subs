00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
few more key points the gameplay is just

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.160 
few more key points the gameplay is just
the<00:02:24.459> same<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:25.360> showing<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.720> more<00:02:25.959> how<00:02:26.140> it

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
might have yes you can do this over the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.160 
might have yes you can do this over the
Internet<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:33.370> tested<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.850> out<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.420> my<00:02:34.959> buddy

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
Internet we tested it out with my buddy

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.820 
Internet we tested it out with my buddy
on<00:02:35.350> 3G<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.130> me<00:02:36.250> being<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.670> Wi-Fi<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:38.350> just

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
on 3G and me being on Wi-Fi but it just

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.780 
on 3G and me being on Wi-Fi but it just
was<00:02:39.040> too<00:02:39.070> laggy<00:02:39.730> over<00:02:40.209> 3G<00:02:40.690> 4G<00:02:41.560> may<00:02:42.160> work<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
was too laggy over 3G 4G may work if you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.370 
was too laggy over 3G 4G may work if you
have<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.120> kind<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.420> setup<00:02:43.630> but<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.959> didn't

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
have that kind of setup but I didn't

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.920 
have that kind of setup but I didn't
have<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.070> test<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.610> performance<00:02:45.930> although

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
have it to test the performance although

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.170 
have it to test the performance although
I'm<00:02:47.019> pretty<00:02:47.260> skeptical<00:02:47.680> another<00:02:48.550> thing<00:02:48.850> here

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
I'm pretty skeptical another thing here

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.330 
I'm pretty skeptical another thing here
is<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:49.420> yes<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.680> notice<00:02:50.980> when<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.160> hit

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
is that yes if you notice when you hit

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.140 
is that yes if you notice when you hit
net<00:02:51.550> play<00:02:52.260> under<00:02:53.260> settings<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.250> more<00:02:54.850> on

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
net play under settings and then more on

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.960 
net play under settings and then more on
the<00:02:55.989> Android<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.620> nestled<00:02:57.070> interface<00:02:57.459> you

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
the Android and nestled interface you

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.440 
the Android and nestled interface you
can<00:02:58.120> also<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.690> over<00:02:59.010> Bluetooth<00:03:00.300> with<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
can also do it over Bluetooth with the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.780 
can also do it over Bluetooth with the
wife<00:03:01.660> with<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.470> client-server<00:03:03.100> type<00:03:03.489> setup

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
wife with the client-server type setup

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.710 
wife with the client-server type setup
but<00:03:04.120> again<00:03:04.570> it<00:03:05.459> was<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.730> in<00:03:06.940> my<00:03:07.090> case<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.600> was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
but again it was just in my case it was

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.890 
but again it was just in my case it was
too<00:03:07.930> laggy<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.760> all<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.150> tests<00:03:10.480> I've<00:03:10.600> I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
too laggy so out of all the tests I've I

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.800 
too laggy so out of all the tests I've I
did<00:03:11.260> pretty<00:03:11.590> much<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.060> in-home<00:03:13.060> sharing<00:03:13.690> on

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
did pretty much the in-home sharing on

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.930 
did pretty much the in-home sharing on
the<00:03:13.900> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.320> was<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.100> best<00:03:15.310> way<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.489> do<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.910> so

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the Wi-Fi was the best way to do it so

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.240 
the Wi-Fi was the best way to do it so
yes<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.750> play<00:03:16.900> two<00:03:17.079> player<00:03:17.320> another
