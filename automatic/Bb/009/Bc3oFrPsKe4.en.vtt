can see if you if you are familiar with
the<00:01:04.850> other<00:01:05.000> tent<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:07.040> doorway<00:01:07.400> is<00:01:08.080> lower<00:01:09.080> not

the other tent the doorway is lower not

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the other tent the doorway is lower not
as<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:10.580> not<00:01:10.610> as<00:01:10.880> tall<00:01:11.120> as<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.390> previous<00:01:11.900> one

as but not as tall as the previous one

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.750 
as but not as tall as the previous one
there's<00:01:13.850> no<00:01:14.000> window<00:01:15.010> which<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.220> some<00:01:16.430> ways<00:01:16.580> is

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
there's no window which in some ways is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.160 
there's no window which in some ways is
better<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.270> my<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.659> window<00:01:18.020> is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
better because my the window is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.750 
better because my the window is
beginning<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.620> show<00:01:18.830> signs<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.460> those<00:01:19.580> go

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
beginning to show signs of those go

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.280 
beginning to show signs of those go
sleek<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.820> venting<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.360> better<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.780> think<00:01:24.140> it

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
sleek the venting is better I think it

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.070 
sleek the venting is better I think it
takes<00:01:24.740> brings<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.460> air<00:01:25.670> from<00:01:25.820> all<00:01:26.000> sides<00:01:26.330> up

takes brings in air from all sides up

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.830 
takes brings in air from all sides up
here<00:01:30.579> it's<00:01:31.579> harder<00:01:31.969> to<00:01:32.090> set<00:01:32.299> up<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.659> takes

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
here it's harder to set up it takes

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.030 
here it's harder to set up it takes
longer<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.409> set<00:01:33.619> up<00:01:33.740> partly<00:01:34.369> because<00:01:35.920> you<00:01:36.920> can

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
longer to set up partly because you can

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.880 
longer to set up partly because you can
see<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.340> width<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:39.140> previous<00:01:39.380> tent

wide<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.690> floor<00:02:29.930> because<00:02:30.260> of<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.470> way<00:02:30.590> my

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
wide on the floor because of the way my

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.670 
wide on the floor because of the way my
interior<00:02:31.970> ground<00:02:32.360> cloth<00:02:32.600> fits<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:36.440> feels

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
interior ground cloth fits but it feels

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.800 
interior ground cloth fits but it feels
roomy<00:02:37.070> inside<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.550> know<00:02:40.640> there<00:02:40.820> are<00:02:41.570> going

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
roomy inside so you know there are going

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.990 
roomy inside so you know there are going
to<00:02:41.870> be<00:02:41.959> pluses<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.530> minuses<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.100> going<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.940> be

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
to be pluses and minuses I'm going to be

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.430 
to be pluses and minuses I'm going to be
living<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.690> little<00:02:44.780> while<00:02:44.900> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
living with this for a little while so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.030 
living with this for a little while so
we'll<00:02:46.250> see<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:47.410> did<00:02:48.410> like<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> other<00:02:48.860> one

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
we'll see I did like the other one

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.100 
we'll see I did like the other one
because<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.280> went<00:02:49.400> up<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.670> minute<00:02:50.110> maybe

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
because it went up in a minute maybe

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.820 
because it went up in a minute maybe
with<00:02:51.350> some<00:02:51.470> practice<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.040> one<00:02:52.250> will<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:54.590> just

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.170 
vestibules so I can keep wet stuff out
there

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.820 

the<00:03:40.600> best-built<00:03:40.960> even<00:03:41.230> big<00:03:41.410> enough<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.770> I

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
the best-built even big enough that I

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.990 
the best-built even big enough that I
can<00:03:42.010> put<00:03:42.790> my<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:45.040> folding<00:03:45.550> chair<00:03:45.790> out

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
there I haven't tried it in gear I think

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.080 
there I haven't tried it in gear I think
it<00:03:49.330> will<00:03:49.690> just<00:03:49.900> take<00:03:50.080> too<00:03:50.260> much<00:03:50.410> room<00:03:50.680> inside

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it will just take too much room inside

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.830 
it will just take too much room inside
but<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.240> tent<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.690> really<00:03:53.400> roomy<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:55.600> plus

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
but the tent is really roomy the plus

the sides go up straight rather than

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
round into the center and that's what

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.010

feel<00:04:44.940> makes<00:04:45.940> it<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> little<00:04:46.180> harder<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.690> set<00:04:46.930> up

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
feel makes it a little harder to set up

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.730 
feel makes it a little harder to set up
I<00:04:47.520> still<00:04:48.520> feel<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.090> way<00:04:49.570> about<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:50.020> but

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.890 

overall<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.640> think<00:04:53.910> it's<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.330> great<00:04:54.450> improvement

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
overall I think it's a great improvement

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.110 
overall I think it's a great improvement
and<00:04:55.260> it's<00:04:55.410> tight<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.980> mean<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.250> just<00:04:56.430> taught<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and it's tight I mean it just taught the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.870 
and it's tight I mean it just taught the
way<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.420> goes<00:04:58.020> together<00:04:58.260> which<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.370> great<00:04:59.400> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
way it goes together which is great and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.290 
way it goes together which is great and
then<00:05:00.120> we<00:05:00.330> have<00:05:00.510> Ranger
