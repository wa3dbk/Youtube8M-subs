00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
half sets you pretty much get the same

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.410 
half sets you pretty much get the same
odds<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.860> other<00:02:10.039> set<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:10.970> instead<00:02:11.390> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
odds as the other set so you instead of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
odds as the other set so you instead of
getting<00:02:11.569> eight<00:02:11.900> hollows<00:02:12.380> per<00:02:12.530> box<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.890> get

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
getting eight hollows per box and get

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.330 
getting eight hollows per box and get
for<00:02:13.220> obviously<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.680> last<00:02:21.830> two<00:02:22.040> cards<00:02:22.250> are

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
for obviously so the last two cards are

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.820 
for obviously so the last two cards are
like<00:02:22.459> exactly<00:02:22.880> same<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.090> before<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:24.440> have<00:02:24.650> a

but<00:05:21.380> maybe<00:05:21.560> that's<00:05:21.770> just<00:05:21.830> me<00:05:21.950> because<00:05:22.160> blue<00:05:22.490> is

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
but maybe that's just me because blue is

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.890 
but maybe that's just me because blue is

actually<00:06:09.860> I<00:06:10.040> think<00:06:10.190> they<00:06:10.370> did<00:06:10.520> a<00:06:10.550> really<00:06:10.610> good

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
actually I think they did a really good

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.370 
actually I think they did a really good
job<00:06:11.060> with<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.480> hollow<00:06:11.630> pattern<00:06:11.990> in<00:06:12.080> this<00:06:12.200> set

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
job with the hollow pattern in this set

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.220 
job with the hollow pattern in this set
in<00:06:12.500> particular<00:06:12.920> just<00:06:12.950> because<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:14.750> hall<00:06:15.080> is

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
in particular just because the hall is

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.320 
in particular just because the hall is
really<00:06:15.500> just<00:06:15.650> they<00:06:16.070> show<00:06:16.550> really<00:06:16.940> well<00:06:17.090> I

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
really just they show really well I

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.790 
really just they show really well I
don't<00:06:17.840> know<00:06:17.930> if<00:06:18.050> you<00:06:18.110> guys<00:06:18.230> can<00:06:18.290> tell<00:06:18.590> just

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
don't know if you guys can tell just

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.960 
don't know if you guys can tell just
looks<00:06:19.250> really<00:06:19.490> nice<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:21.070> I<00:06:22.070> think<00:06:22.460> aside<00:06:22.790> from

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
looks really nice and I think aside from

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.950 
looks really nice and I think aside from
that<00:06:24.460> like<00:06:25.460> unless<00:06:25.910> we<00:06:26.060> pull<00:06:26.210> an<00:06:26.300> SP<00:06:26.660> we

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
that like unless we pull an SP we

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.720 
that like unless we pull an SP we
shouldn't<00:06:27.200> get<00:06:27.260> anything<00:06:27.500> else<00:06:27.770> another

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
shouldn't get anything else another

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.440 
shouldn't get anything else another
