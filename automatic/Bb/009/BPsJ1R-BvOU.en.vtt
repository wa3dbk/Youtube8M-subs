00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.430
 Welcome to another gameplay video . 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.240
 of people will play from the end of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.800
 2008 bits 1986 and we are going to the game then already 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 I have to select the game with the name 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.240
 because his name is like and does not 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.850
 0 and we go to the game is no sword 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.269
 I played a little bit just for this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.310
 kind of blindly here almost 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:43.469
 is approximately half of the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:45.510
 first step let's explain the game 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.629
 was not controlling the song or in the case 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 spoiling her, it's ok then we do not 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 uses sword and in summer does nothing for 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.190
 while they can not provoke enemies 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.670
 and this is it 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 Now let's kill that bug has to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.969
 we did not win anything and the first lady 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969
 joana tree 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.170
 let's go left first 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.090
 first of all, that's it, I do not 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.950
 I got there I got swords because nothing after 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 of the sword and errors things remain after 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 here we see the map and the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.569
 skate does not have any items 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 we have a sword in the dark listening is not 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:32.490
 important every time we take 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 first key then I opened the door and 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 let's go to the right path 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.319
 The business here is to kill the non- enemies. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.319
 know what to do 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:55.960
 It's the damn we passed there died key to 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:57.520
 ball finally kill yourself all music and this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 there you can see with the difference of 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.960
 grace of the telescope of thirty 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.830
 eight bishops of today who stand the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.310
 cry 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.170
 I feel the difference so I do not know who 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.280
 Gracyanne complains joke looks like her 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.319
 evolved in which game here is also not 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.950
 bad just to play from the sides can be 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.540
 not the best but that's good but I 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.060
 I think is good is good right never had this 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:29.049
 game I know I played once and 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.959
 I'm not very well and won the game is 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:41.440
 that without that history begins only in its 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:43.390
 adventure and by piddac and steals the key is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.290
 important to really kill all friends 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.290
 Let's go in Bolivia. 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.420
 Ok, I 'm leaving. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.670
 Hi, I passed by mate, I'm leaving. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.590
 I'm the one in charge, now let's kill. 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.160
 even to see if we're going to win some 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.910
 thing or not there a thing to that shot 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.220
 here you play the sword ticket only 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.490
 when you are with your whole life to 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.510
 realize it nobody anything then open the 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.510
 door leaks 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:29.030
 provide it is not so 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.030
 because 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:40.870
 map theory should be 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.760
 I was just a little bit there and we're going 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.980
 open the door 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.930
 wait for him there 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.409
 but the deloitte in the creature when a 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.409
 a little 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.019
 the mpu distant attack is cowardice 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.480
 the people also deserve a coward in bar 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.480
 know you look with your heart 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.390
 Geez, it's just the suspect, bro. 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.050
 little papaw over there 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.050
 one minute 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.590
 ah ah ah ah the clock 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.090
 obviously to stop the time when 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:29.750
 but I stay near the wall but 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.449
 appear for the time trying not to have 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.520
 nothing to do with music here 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.229
 star marketing but it's because she 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.349
 He wins for the time there he fights with 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.349
 nilmar 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:52.170
 the dragon there is very easy admits 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.170
 opposition of wanting a boss 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:03.100
 the first part of the triforce has a 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.300
 part that has not yet passed the night is not 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:14.310
 so hard this way 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:14.310
 I expected it to be while the hang 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.960
 region in this sense not you think 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.430
 that we were going to spend the time the arrangement 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.530
 that calls for time but as I do not 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.180
 I got boomerang 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.600
 during that time he is the truth 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.960
 It's what you should have 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.990
 I happened to get 25 cast along with her 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.550
 legal and gameplay does not make much sense in 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.340
 games of today in day of transit 10 to 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:51.060
 People take and use the same of the angel 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.060
 the weather nowadays makes more sense 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.680
 In this game, you do not even have to 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:04.510
 people are going to pass kisses, she already 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:06.010
 This radical committee paralyzes this 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.400
 he would stop serve did not work too much 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:13.340
 good 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.650
 Will not it also means you are not prey 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.930
 You're welcome 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:24.650
 hey hey hey 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:28.610
 the enemy and enem is asking the end of the 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:35.770
 enemies they go when I by merengue 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:37.009
 does not affect pretend to kill stan spider 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.210

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:45.889

 now I'm the game or come on the 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.600
 question is who will buy crack 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:59.810

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.970
 It's only until the next episode of Yeda 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.160
 also episode does not go until the next ag 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.990
 plate anything and until the next 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.039
 large player can contain game so it is
