00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello her dear friends today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.509
 your favorite bummer starts 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.760
 develop a third level of dissent 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 can you give me to want me too 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 long pull ivan like you understand this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 fair Well before 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 start i want you a little bit what what 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 ask her something ask ask 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 I want to make you the first second video 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.740
 somehow clicked to share 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.269
 spread course where it is important that a little 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.420
 a little more audience was because I 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.149
 I spend a lot of time on this card 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.500
 but my inner Jew says 12 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.610
 from 15 6 thousand views it is not enough 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.750
 because there is still enough 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.879
 slowly i think you understand well i 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.460
 I hope she has help here and I want 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 something you ask you don't mind if 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 I will be laying such small 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 10 minutes less than the time the martyrs 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.600
 vocabulary from the map where I build it too 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.719
 will be so can the music 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 there is no music crap 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.439
 accelerated where I'll just show how 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 and astral is a natural map of itself 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 interesting moments since it was built 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 how this goes works just under 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.240
 Muzychka interesting enough because of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 like that write comments that you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.880
 Do you want this or write comments that you 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 this do not want all this that all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.110
 it was a secret well well 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.500
 And I also want to say that this card will be 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.020
 much harder than 1 2 not in terms of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.180
 passing a in terms of what its like 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 much harder to build if the first second 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.820
 level was just a straight straight line with 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.909
 the obstacles here will be the diagonal 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 Steeplechase line and here too the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.930
 problems because you have to do it 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.490
 that it looked not just when 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.689
 you play you don't have to see just 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.460
 in front of a wall which is necessary 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.850
 climb and so it looked 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 more or less so to say smoothly like me 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.380
 I will do on not under 45 degrees under 30 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.549
 that is, there will not be something that singled out 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.689
 own two blocks 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.820
 it's like they are a square country then here 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.610
 four or five miles so will 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.069
 more or less yes and easier to install 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 mechanism and so on yes like all 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.020
 I will not reveal the secrets I will say this 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 what 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.300
 the boss will be in disco style hope you all 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.670
 know such great cards that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.950

 teams whether a team or one person i'm not 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.530
