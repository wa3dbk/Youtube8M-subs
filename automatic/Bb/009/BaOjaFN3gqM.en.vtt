00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
why Michael the reluctance of a John

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.609 
why Michael the reluctance of a John
Farrell<00:02:03.219> or<00:02:03.340> anybody<00:02:03.789> else<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:05.110> many

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
pitchers use something periodically

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.210 
pitchers use something periodically
through<00:02:08.440> their<00:02:08.530> career<00:02:08.769> I'm<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:08.979> saying

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
through their career I'm not saying

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790 
through their career I'm not saying
every<00:02:09.429> game<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:10.360> get<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.569> better<00:02:10.810> grip<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
every game to get a better grip and I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.430 
every game to get a better grip and I
still<00:02:12.160> don't<00:02:12.370> understand<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.180> rule<00:02:13.480> as<00:02:13.810> to

still don't understand that rule as to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380 
still don't understand that rule as to
why<00:02:14.620> that's<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.040> bad<00:02:15.250> thing<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.940> pitcher<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
why that's a bad thing for a pitcher to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390 
why that's a bad thing for a pitcher to
have<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> better<00:02:17.140> grip<00:02:17.590> we're<00:02:17.950> not<00:02:18.069> talking

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
have a better grip we're not talking

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.030 
have a better grip we're not talking
about<00:02:19.110> altering<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.319> flight<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
about altering the flight or the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160 
about altering the flight or the
integrity<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.730> pitch<00:02:21.970> based<00:02:22.660> on<00:02:22.870> something

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
integrity of a pitch based on something

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.780 
integrity of a pitch based on something
that<00:02:23.319> will<00:02:23.530> enable<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.160> pitcher<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.549> have<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that will enable a pitcher to have the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.860 
that will enable a pitcher to have the
ball<00:02:24.940> slip<00:02:25.209> out<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.420> his<00:02:25.480> hand

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
ball slip out of his hand

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.540 
ball slip out of his hand
thus<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.940> greased<00:02:27.940> pitch<00:02:28.239> or<00:02:28.510> spit<00:02:29.290> ball

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
thus a greased pitch or spit ball

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.610 
thus a greased pitch or spit ball
that's<00:02:31.150> why<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.600> rosin<00:02:31.930> bag<00:02:32.050> rosin<00:02:32.500> bag

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that's why there's a rosin bag rosin bag

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.740 
that's why there's a rosin bag rosin bag
