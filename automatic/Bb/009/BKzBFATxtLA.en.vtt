00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
like with one layer on totally evens out

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.969 
like with one layer on totally evens out
my<00:01:26.030> skin<00:01:26.450> tone<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.700> still<00:01:28.940> see<00:01:29.210> some

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
my skin tone and you can still see some

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.740 
my skin tone and you can still see some
of<00:01:30.979> my<00:01:31.250> skin<00:01:31.550> underneath<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.090> foundation<00:01:32.600> it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
of my skin underneath the foundation it

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.469 
of my skin underneath the foundation it
is<00:01:32.780> pretty<00:01:33.290> high<00:01:33.560> coverage<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.910> imagined

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
is pretty high coverage and I imagined

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.520 
is pretty high coverage and I imagined
it<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.660> be

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
it to be

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.770 
it to be
completely<00:01:37.220> full<00:01:37.580> coverage<00:01:38.000> if<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.360> applied

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
completely full coverage if I applied

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.190 
completely full coverage if I applied
another<00:01:39.080> layer<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:40.910> think<00:01:41.600> one<00:01:41.840> layer<00:01:42.080> is

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
another layer but I think one layer is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.350 
another layer but I think one layer is
just<00:01:42.470> enough<00:01:42.740> for<00:01:42.979> me<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.149> not

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
just enough for me I like that it is not

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.840 
just enough for me I like that it is not
completely<00:01:44.630> matte<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:46.100> does<00:01:46.340> still<00:01:46.670> look

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
completely matte so it does still look

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.730 
completely matte so it does still look
like<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.030> natural<00:01:47.570> skin<00:01:48.020> I'm<00:01:48.289> just<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.710> to

like a natural skin I'm just going to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.980 
like a natural skin I'm just going to

out literally all day around my nose

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.569 
out literally all day around my nose
area

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
area

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.569 
area
the<00:03:51.760> foundation<00:03:52.299> has<00:03:52.329> rubbed<00:03:53.290> off<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:54.129> is

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
the foundation has rubbed off but it is

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.670 
the foundation has rubbed off but it is
almost<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.479> happens<00:03:55.840> almost<00:03:56.169> all<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.470> time

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
almost it happens almost all the time

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.740 
almost it happens almost all the time
because<00:03:56.859> I'm<00:03:57.099> always<00:03:57.250> scratching<00:03:57.699> my<00:03:58.090> nose<00:03:58.150> I

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
because I'm always scratching my nose I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.449 
because I'm always scratching my nose I
think<00:03:59.079> using<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> setting<00:03:59.859> powder<00:04:00.040> in

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
think using the setting powder in

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.180 
think using the setting powder in
general<00:04:01.120> would<00:04:01.299> help<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.260> foundation<00:04:02.650> last

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
general would help the foundation last

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.939 
general would help the foundation last
long<00:04:03.519> my<00:04:04.169> bronzer<00:04:05.169> and<00:04:05.290> blush<00:04:05.349> just<00:04:05.769> look

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
long my bronzer and blush just look

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.059 
long my bronzer and blush just look
really<00:04:06.220> blotchy<00:04:06.729> so<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.479> didn't<00:04:08.470> seem<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.919> hold

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
really blotchy so it didn't seem to hold

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.080 
really blotchy so it didn't seem to hold
up<00:04:09.250> pretty<00:04:09.519> well<00:04:09.669> today<00:04:10.150> overall<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:12.090> don't

think<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:13.569> would<00:04:13.720> purchase<00:04:13.959> this<00:04:14.379> foundation

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
think I would purchase this foundation

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.360 
think I would purchase this foundation
again<00:04:15.959> for<00:04:16.959> my<00:04:17.109> skin<00:04:17.500> at<00:04:17.650> least<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:17.979> have<00:04:18.190> oily

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
again for my skin at least I have oily

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.159 
again for my skin at least I have oily
combination<00:04:18.699> skin<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.510> wouldn't<00:04:19.870> wear<00:04:19.959> this

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
combination skin I wouldn't wear this

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.140 
combination skin I wouldn't wear this
during<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.620> summer<00:04:20.859> however<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:21.549> feel<00:04:21.849> this

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
during the summer however I feel this

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.510 
during the summer however I feel this

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.750 
would be ideal for me during the cold
winters<00:04:25.120> where<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.020> want<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.770> luminosity<00:04:27.190> and

some<00:04:47.009> kind<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.520> setting<00:04:47.970> powder<00:04:48.800> at<00:04:49.800> least<00:04:50.189> on

the<00:04:50.520> t-zone<00:04:50.759> because<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.719> light<00:04:51.930> just

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
the t-zone because the light just

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.619
