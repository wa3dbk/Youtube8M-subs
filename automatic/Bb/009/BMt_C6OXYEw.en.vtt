messy and it's kind of cool how the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
messy and it's kind of cool how the
kernel<00:01:16.710> stick<00:01:17.070> together<00:01:17.390> looks<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
kernel stick together looks like a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
kernel stick together looks like a
little<00:01:18.930> caterpillar<00:01:19.470> oh<00:01:19.770> yeah<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> there's
