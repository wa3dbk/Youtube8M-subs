00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello everybody it's ben ali 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 arrows to show you and so his 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.470
 little tutorial to show you how 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.330
 to make a manger to apologize I 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.570
 found a way to show it so 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.570
 all that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:32.099
 2 preferences is more flexible 1.6 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:38.120
 to the coach there is a piece of cardboard 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.120
 flexible dying saveterre small so 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:51.809
 like that pretty much no need for very 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 big so we start by cutting 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.850
 in two for the if against you have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.460
 little pimples like that inside 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.899
 we will take them in but cut 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 so a cut in half so that's 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.930
 fill in actually it's the clan but we 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.990
 and are more easily will they 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.950
 are thinner than the bottle found 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:21.360
 thicker a price are more durable 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:23.280
 it is necessary to remove fags santis and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:33.900
 respect for the fifteen pieces if 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:34.860
 easy the coast are not a drag on 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.280
 little together 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280
 fortunately 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:54.530
 it must be right not pass 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.530
 too much the case that I size and a little bit 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:06.860
 for me then we put more you need 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.450
 also grasses 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.670
 do you use to make 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.430
 hearts we arrows started right away 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.000
 that there is one but I made understand to 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 impute at worst to cancel the laws of the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 commented time m 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.989
 so that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.110
 no because now we understand our 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:41.190
 piece of cardboard and our coach 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:46.610
 So we see what we coach and my boxes 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.610
 sees a dead person on a pass like sarba 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 right here 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:09.920
 it still stuck the case but that but he 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.260
 really have to be tight 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.270
 who are really there so it can not do anything 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.530
 like that but then it could open 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:36.130
 so he's going to make it another 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:36.130
 piece but we understand a brush 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.570
 is not taped the padres on the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:49.250
 sides so that this coach good for you 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:55.480
 can cut like this and then there we go 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.480
 a few arpents seco 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.430
 many as well as instead of the good 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.739
 glue but we find it worse at 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:16.900
 snack with a pistol 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:32.080
 uhu glue monday and up to chad holds 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:34.750
 very well that cola chambas did 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.800
 it rises and 320 m it's cash 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:44.979
 the mill part it's not very common 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 will debut this bus transport 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:05:17.409
 coach who knows so that's it so 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:21.130
 then we can say that like that 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:23.050
 seems so much less we can stick 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:45.000
 eg on peoples doors 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:45.000
 box is so either inside 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.870
 I think we hold boxing he failed 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.919
 to the boo to eat at the end in this 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:01.060
 stable there so I put it like that otherwise 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:03.970
 the others and so what I did 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:10.150
 hard to do I put it in the direction of 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.660
 box so it's nice enough it's 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.050
 not bad 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:19.120
 then the days like that of event of 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.229
 will fight 7th so my video for you 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.260
 show how to make beautiful 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:26.729
 feeders for banks arrows 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.729
