00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.320
 sheldon cooper I'm a subnormal and I 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.080
 like the piece of shit the camera already 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.270
 is recording enough of bullshit this 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.030
 debate has no purpose we all know 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.620
 that xbox is the leader in sales always 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.650
 very much above the shit that of the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.960
 playstation calla rock or pimp 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.420
 fucking console is only sold because 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.030
 she's more cheap whore than your mother but 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.730
 now that its cost exceeded those of ps4 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.220
 your console Basque will go to hell 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.440
 not to mention that it has a design of the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.630
 network and shit and your trash controls 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.630
 they still need double batteries 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.590
 that there are in assholes that the expert is going to 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.630
 talk about xbox one 8 core microsoft 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.459
 houston 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:39.110
 175 ghz ps four singles and x86 to me 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.790
 daughter or professor 8 cores 1 6ghz with the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.860
 last publication at the beginning of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.989
 September of microsoft about his 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.150
 ctc update an increase of 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.069
 10% have managed to overcome 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.080
 officially in some facet of the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:56.209
 technical specifications of both 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.320
 consoles xbox one +1 ram xbox one 8 gb 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.120
 ddr3 2.133 where he has his band peak 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.190
 wide at 68 gigabytes 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.310
 s &amp; p s 48 gb gddr5 where you use a bus 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.790
 256 bit which offers us a maximum 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.519
 broadband 176 gigabyte s s 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.890
 At first we could deduce that ts 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.709
 4 ram memory effects will be very much 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.680
 more powerful than xbox one really this 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.480
 it's not like that since using gddr5 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.070
 we get an additional problem 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.120
 related to latency have been made 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.780
 many times marx 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.610
 with ddr3 and gddr5 whose results are 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.769
 very similar in both since the 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.569
 latency will be a problem that will pursue 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.269
 are and throughout the course of the new 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.760
 generation still we bet 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.260
 that ps4 will finally give greater 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.420
 performance that xbox one ps4 +1 your xbox 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.510
 one 853 megahertz amd radeon with 768 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.379
 shaders maximum performance of the push button 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.750
 is estimated at 131 teraflops s &amp; p bar 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:06.650
 s 4 and radeon graphics core in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.670
 extraining with 1,152 performance shaders 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.290
 maximum of the button is estimated at 184 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.230
 teraflops bar s the main 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.729
 difference between both consoles was 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.070
 fundamentally the graphic engine since 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.430
 according to its technical characteristics ps4 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.260
 will be 50% more powerful at the time of 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.510
 process the visual effects of the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.669
 games is to say over time the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.090
 large companies that develop the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.169
 games will evolve in the graphic engine 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.720
 considerably with what inside 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.900
 A few years estimate that about 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.050
 years we will see that ts 4 render to with 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.730
 much more quality than xbox one ps four 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.160
 plus one I said a lot 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.460
 prescott you have to say something good to 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.380
 then I will say the apps of each one 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.540
 playstation 4 uses apps like netflix 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.840
 you can surf the internet in a way 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.000
 Free play movies games or 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.130
 music by voice only if you have 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.530
 playstation eye uses other devices 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.980
 as a second screen with the application 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.510
 play station and also on ps vita 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.000
 Hold prescott like I said I want 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.480
 defend xbox john I said your apps 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.790
 xbox go things like netflix just with 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.180
 subscriptions walking and gold plays 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.040
 pay television signal in hd 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.670
 compatible with skip by means of kinect 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.980

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.320
 subscriptions book live gold plays 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.200
 movies I play your music by means of 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.240
 voice through kinect 2.0 uses others 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.610
 devices like second screen with 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.800
 the smart glass app with everything 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.320
 that you just said it's clear to me that 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.390
 your parents did not give you love so 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.419
 cruel and bitch was your mother to not give you 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.760
 love of emptiness left by your mother the linden 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.890
 you filled with technology and money for that 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.110
 is that your console shit was and any 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.270
 garbage produced by your company is not 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.070
 more than computer scum 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.890
 yes i know your mother has nothing to do 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.870
 with this debate but if I do not get 50 what 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.940
 that in dollars a vampire marico bring 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.729
 milk will kill me who told him 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.729
 vampire swallows milk dies for asshole 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.030
 well from now on I'll talk about the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.310
 ps4 playstation 4 you can add 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.490
 storage with internal hard drives 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.710
 It has 2 USB 3.0 ports compatible with 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.660
 cloud storage with gaikai 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.820
 to stream some titles 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.600
 from ps3 it's good time to give the 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.090
 conclusion and the answer is the ps4 if 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.250
 that's how the ps4 proves to have better 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.750
 performance towards his rival the xbox juan 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.970
 they can check their 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.550
 characteristics and they will know that I am in 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.710
 right as you dare to say that 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.169
