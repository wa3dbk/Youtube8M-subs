00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
you've got a new car coming in Barcelona

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.599 
you've got a new car coming in Barcelona
what<00:00:02.250> are<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.399> looking<00:00:02.790> for<00:00:03.570> from<00:00:03.899> it<00:00:04.430> well<00:00:05.430> we

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
what are you looking for from it well we

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.500 
what are you looking for from it well we
have<00:00:05.970> a<00:00:06.000> upgrade<00:00:06.660> than<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.560> Barcelona

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
have a upgrade than in Barcelona

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.610 
have a upgrade than in Barcelona
unfortunately<00:00:09.510> than<00:00:09.660> not<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> new<00:00:10.200> car<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
unfortunately than not a new car that

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.770 
unfortunately than not a new car that
happens<00:00:10.950> maybe<00:00:11.099> 211<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.389> have<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.599> wait<00:00:12.750> for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
happens maybe 211 so we have to wait for

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.920 
happens maybe 211 so we have to wait for
that<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:14.089> the<00:00:15.089> question<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:16.100> how<00:00:17.100> big<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.400> step

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
that but the question is how big a step

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.230 
that but the question is how big a step
naturally<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.770> roam<00:00:20.220> free<00:00:20.490> by<00:00:20.699> girlfri

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
naturally we can do roam free by girlfri

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.060 
naturally we can do roam free by girlfri
compared<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> others<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> catch

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
compared to the others we have to catch

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.880 
compared to the others we have to catch
up<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.480> quite<00:00:24.689> obviously<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.369> I

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
up as we quite obviously can see but I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.070 
up as we quite obviously can see but I
have<00:00:28.890> seen<00:00:29.160> good<00:00:30.000> potential<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.869> seen

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
have seen good potential and have seen

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.049 
have seen good potential and have seen
great<00:00:31.199> work<00:00:31.529> from<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> team<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
great work from the team in in the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.049 
great work from the team in in the
region<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.750> bra<00:00:34.020> bracelet<00:00:34.670> manage<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> alone

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
region the bra bracelet manage is alone

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.190 
region the bra bracelet manage is alone
who<00:00:36.329> denies<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.840> yeah<00:00:38.809> we<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.960> made<00:00:40.170> every

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
who denies you yeah we have made every

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.610 
who denies you yeah we have made every
rate<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.219> step<00:00:41.700> forward<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.320> again<00:00:43.320> here

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
rate kind of step forward and again here

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
rate kind of step forward and again here
we<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.920> hopefully<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> step

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
we we hopefully going through a step

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
we we hopefully going through a step
forward<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.170> barcelona<00:00:47.090> though

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
forward and so we do in barcelona though

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
forward and so we do in barcelona though
i<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.469> find<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
i don't think we will find out in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.529 
i don't think we will find out in
barcelona<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.930> percent<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> make

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
barcelona that percent we going to make

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
barcelona that percent we going to make
it's<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.870> big<00:00:54.989> enough<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> sort<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
it's going to be big enough to sort of

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's going to be big enough to sort of
drive<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.940> front<00:00:57.180> everybody<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.530> an

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
drive up front everybody because it's an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.279 
drive up front everybody because it's an
upgrade<00:00:59.010> its<00:00:59.250> step<00:00:59.879> forward<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.329> probably

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
upgrade its step forward but probably

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.520 
upgrade its step forward but probably
not<00:01:01.410> big<00:01:01.620> enough<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:03.210> immediately<00:01:03.660> win<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
not big enough to immediately win but

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
not big enough to immediately win but
then<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.040> progression<00:01:05.640> keeps<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
then the progression keeps on going and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
then the progression keeps on going and
i<00:01:07.049> hope<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.409> once<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> quicker<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
i hope our once it quicker than the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
i hope our once it quicker than the
others<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.540> steps<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.080> learning<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
others the steps about learning not to

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
others the steps about learning not to
make<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> car<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> nose<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
make the car a bit more on the nose the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.149 
make the car a bit more on the nose the
way<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:13.979> less<00:01:15.110> at<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> back<00:01:16.439> let<00:01:16.830> let

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
way you like it less at the back let let

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
way you like it less at the back let let
on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> theory<00:01:17.729> no<00:01:18.530> sir<00:01:19.670> put<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.090> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
on the theory no sir put it this way we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.359 
on the theory no sir put it this way we
for<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:21.990> will<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.799> certain<00:01:23.460> changes<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
for sure will make certain changes that

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
for sure will make certain changes that
may<00:01:26.369> help<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> front<00:01:26.970> end<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.420> he's<00:01:27.829> probably

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
may help the front end as he's probably

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
may help the front end as he's probably
a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.250> bit<00:01:29.490> weak<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> moment<00:01:31.340> but<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
a little bit weak as a moment but it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
a little bit weak as a moment but it's
not<00:01:33.329> only<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.590> focusing<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
not only for that that we're focusing on

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
not only for that that we're focusing on
I<00:01:35.189> mean<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.579> need<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> really<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> general

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I mean you need to really have a general

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
I mean you need to really have a general
performance<00:01:37.640> improvement<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> general

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
performance improvement the general

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.289 
performance improvement the general
downforce<00:01:39.780> efficiency<00:01:40.650> increase<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.759> we

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
downforce efficiency increase that we

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.080 
downforce efficiency increase that we
actually<00:01:42.930> look<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.520> other

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
actually look for but so it is the other

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.590 
actually look for but so it is the other
other<00:01:45.509> areas<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:46.350> think<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:47.009> approve

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
other areas that we think we can approve

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
other areas that we think we can approve
saying<00:01:48.600> once<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.259> car<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.680> develop

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
saying once you get that car and develop

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.280 
saying once you get that car and develop
it<00:01:50.189> after<00:01:50.610> Barcelona<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.810> feel<00:01:52.049> you'll

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
it after Barcelona then you feel you'll

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.870 
it after Barcelona then you feel you'll
be<00:01:52.680> properly<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> hunt<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
be properly in the hunt for the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.590 
be properly in the hunt for the
championship<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:55.880> sort<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> said<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> do

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
championship I sort of said that we do

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.959 
championship I sort of said that we do
step-by-step<00:01:57.950> improvements<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> maybe<00:01:59.820> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
step-by-step improvements and maybe in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550 
step-by-step improvements and maybe in
Barcelona<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.960> bigger<00:02:01.200> steps

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
Barcelona we have a little bigger steps

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.850 
Barcelona we have a little bigger steps
that<00:02:01.799> we've<00:02:01.950> had<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.939> first<00:02:03.119> races<00:02:03.860> but

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
that we've had in the first races but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.050 
that we've had in the first races but
again<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:08.369> new

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.300 
again I don't think we will have a new
kind<00:02:09.330> Barcelona<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you know it would have been naturally

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.820

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
i'm a little bit behind my teammate but

if<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.860> look<00:03:27.980> in<00:03:28.280> detail<00:03:28.519> it's<00:03:29.360> very<00:03:29.600> close

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
if you look in detail it's very close

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.270 
if you look in detail it's very close
and<00:03:31.420> given<00:03:32.420> a<00:03:32.510> little<00:03:32.720> bit<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.950> time<00:03:33.950> i'm

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
and given a little bit of time i'm

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.890 
and given a little bit of time i'm
pretty<00:03:34.700> sure<00:03:34.850> how<00:03:35.090> good<00:03:35.239> reasons<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.690> believe

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
pretty sure how good reasons to believe

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.210 
pretty sure how good reasons to believe
that<00:03:36.049> I<00:03:36.530> can<00:03:37.130> fight<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:38.510> not<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.750> magician<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.769> I

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
that I can fight I'm not a magician so I

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.650 
that I can fight I'm not a magician so I
guess<00:03:40.970> it's<00:03:41.330> normal<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:42.590> should<00:03:43.570> sort<00:03:44.570> of

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
guess it's normal that I should sort of

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
guess it's normal that I should sort of
take<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> little<00:03:45.049> bit<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.260> time<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.799> do<00:03:46.190> my

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
take a little bit of time and do my

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.390 
take a little bit of time and do my
steps<00:03:46.700> forward<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:47.269> from<00:03:47.510> my<00:03:47.660> side<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.560> enjoy

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
steps forward but from my side I enjoy

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.840 
steps forward but from my side I enjoy
every<00:03:49.700> bit<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.090> are<00:03:50.299> two<00:03:50.450> very<00:03:50.480> good
