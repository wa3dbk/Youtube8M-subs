00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 all right 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.340
 do not 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello everyone today I'm going to show you one 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.029
 recipe that is a basic something that does not 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.980
 may be missing in our rice cookbook 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 integral 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.960
 ecological and we will cook it from a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.580
 very simple but safe way so that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 I look good with just plain water 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.580
 quality and a little bit of sea salt and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.970
 then we will accompany him with rubber 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.690
 that sesame roasted and crushed with salt 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 Marine 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.030
 Well then, let's go to work, let's wash 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.030
 the rice this is the first step 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.560
 we remove 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 and notice how the impurities come out 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.580
 float is that it is very curious and this does not 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.150
 we will be eating if we do not wash it 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.150
 vinaròs 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 in this way we undo if 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.690
 escape a granite nothing happens in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.940
 principle those who float those who 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.420
 remain on the surface is that they are not 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 very good quality we repeat a couple of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.740
 times and that's it and now we're going to the phase 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.740
 of the colander 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.480
 once we wash it we will leave it in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.050
 Soak with two parts of water 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.360
 and with this same water will do with the 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.880
 that we are going to cook the rice and soak 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.620
 from one to three hours in this way the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 grain detects a high degree of humidity and 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.780
 begins the germination process with what 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.540
 which the grain opens and there is much more 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.720
 digestive and easy to cook after 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 have left it to soak for 23 hours 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:11.510
 we put it in our pot we turn it on 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.510
 the fire and we bring it to a boil 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.799
 now that is the boiling rice 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.799
 let's add salt 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 and it is already 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.130
 we lower the heat to the minimum and 45 minutes 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.370
 let's see how we have left the rice 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:43.150
 I told you that 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.150
 and it's going to come out well in chain we open 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.430
 and then the pint is you see these as 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:55.760
 small holes 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.760
 that indicator that the thing has gone well 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:05.570
 we do not have any perfect liquid and 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.570
 we're ready better than the oar we're going 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.170
 for 7 the most homogeneous 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.470
 and you're ready to eat just like that but 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.879
 that we can also do it in 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.360
 salad put them like a paella 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.550
 making a collision with prawns what 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.970
 We want the simplest way to 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.970
 to serve 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.210
 well here and I love it is doing well 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.210
 rice balls 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.150
 this would be like our bread to the side 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:48.840
 basic neutral to join it with the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.840
 salsita then look at this 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.270
 this is him 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.850
 sesame that we've toasted it and we've 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.060
 crushed with sea ​​salt that we have left 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.569
 by far as well as a semi crushed 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.330
 and accompanies the arrocito very well what 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.330
 decorate with two basil leaves 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.480
 ah 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.630
 and we already have our share of hydrates 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.140
 of the best quality carbon 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.500
 I leave you with this simple recipe but 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.170
 sublime of brown rice for 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.750
