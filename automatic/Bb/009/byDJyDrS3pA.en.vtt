00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone today let's talk a little 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.250
 of the diane mega links with outgoing 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.190
 the corners here we have the juice here 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 is I bought it in light take for 22 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.120
 dollars I leave the link in the description 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.510
 in case you want to buy it I already had a 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.480
 damaged mega links this here but had 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.420
 eager to prove that it feels to have 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.039
 one with relief in the corners here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 you can see with a little more detail 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 the corners of the corners I have to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.759
 recognize that nothing else out of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 box does not finish convincing me was 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 too tight and the turn was 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 pretty slow but we should not leave 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.870
 carry the first impressions already 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.180
 that this cube holds great potential 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.940
 inside and how we can release 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.309
 said potential thus adjusting the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 tensions and properly lubricating the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.100
 Cube 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 if we follow these two steps we will have a 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.829
 extraordinary product for me the best 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.199
 of market gaming now it's not 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.879
 easy to adjust the tensions takes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.559
 enough time I in fact still not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.750
 I have finished finding the tensions 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.150
 what I like most is hard to find 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 a balance between the 12 voltages of the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.520
 Cube 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.189
 but once we found it I think that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 this cube is unsurpassed the quality of the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.399
 turn is impressive the truth is a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.670
 noisy twist how can you hear and 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.340
 Quick 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.200
 movements flow like water in 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.130
 a river the cutting of corners also what 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.259
 does without problem 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.030
 let's see you see that he has no 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.210
 kind of problem let's just put 36 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.210
 degrees 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 have no problem let's put a little 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.380
 more even and also gets it done 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.140
 and the reverse cut the reverse cut 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.200
 have more problems you see we're going to see 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.360
 it costs it a little bit does not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 man I think that equal adjusting a 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.340
 little better the tensions we can 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 improve it but good you see that until here 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.659
 more or less does it in off and since 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.539
 we talk about the reverse cut I have to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.890
 say that this cube does not pop ever of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.470
 done we are going to force a reverse cut 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.950
 for example let's do something like that for 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.500
 that the pieces are forced and you see that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.570
 it is impossible I have reinforced enough what 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.430
 tried and does not pop any 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.440
 way this cube does not know the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.570
 meaning of the word pop as I said 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.270
 previously the movements flow without 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.910
 problem but once in a while there is 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.250
 light locks something normal in the mega 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.230
 mins but let's go anything that calls a lot 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.440
 So clear attention if the reverse cut 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.090
 it is practically non-existent good 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.630
 man something like that but it costs 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.190
 quite 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.450
 then clear when we do algorithms 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.450
 it is inevitable that at some point 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.209
 we have something like that and then we try 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.130
 do this movement and the cube then 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.400
 clear it gets blocked and you stay 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.290
 stuck no small blocks always 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.150
 there are always in these cubes but good 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.970
 nothing that catches the attention the normal 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
 I have to recognize that the outgoing 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.550
 help when executing the turns 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 since you know that in the mega min 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.180
 it's pretty easy for your fingers to 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.000
 skate and then with the help of the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.280
 outgoing we have a better grip besides 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.320
 if I'm not mistaken they are allowed in 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.660
 the competitions aesthetically I do not 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.700
 they like it a lot but I have to recognize 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.890
 what are 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.470
 of great help another option to improve 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.379
 the grip instead of the protrusions would be 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 use taiz we can buy a mega déjà 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:28.660
 mix that has no outgoing and put 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.310
 then such but it is something that leads 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.380
 enough work here we can see a 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 little the inside of the structure of the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 mega mix we quickly recognize the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.400
 typical curved shapes of the products 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.519
 from ayhan and here we can see an edge and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.739
 a corner we see thus the forms that 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.590
 they have and that is how they would look when 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.959
 they are stuck right you see that there is a gap 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 important in the middle and these are the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.549
 contact zones areas of interest 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.620
 to lubricate so that the friction is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.230
 minimal a great design without any doubt 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.930
 here we have the mega mix diane version and 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.170
 here the mega mix version in show that 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.000
 as I recommend then let's see if not 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.549
 you are a big fan of mega links 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.620
 and the only thing you're looking for is to solve it 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.450
 you do not quietly do 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.700
 speed club and you want to have a good cube 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.979
 at the same time and you do not want to break the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.560
 head adjusting tensions on 12 faces and 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.910
 Lubricating the hub properly 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.730
 then I recommend you without any doubt 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.410
 of the sensor 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.450
 It is a product with a relationship 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.280
 unbeatable quality-price a product 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.610
 of high quality do not get me wrong 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.000
 it's a great mega mix costs just 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.890
 nine dollars in light take and the other 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.320
 it costs 22 voucher there are 13 dollars 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.880
 difference and also the same zone you in 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.680
 how much do you get out of the box is ready 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.480
 to use in fact to me if you give me these 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.450
 two cubes just take them out of the box 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.120
 I'll take the game show it because 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.710
 It is perfect to use and this without 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.750
 But it was quite hard and a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.150
 bit slow now well if you're a 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.010
 hardcore user of mega links if you 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.840
 You already dedicate in a professional way to 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.490
 solve the mega ming if you love 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.920
 Entertain yourself by adjusting tensions 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.540
 lubricating the cube properly 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.310
 then I recommend the version of 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.760
 diane without a doubt every dollar 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.240
 invested in this in this cube deserves the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.080
 Sorry, yes, we're definitely going 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.140
 here I say goodbye with the mega links 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.120
 version of ayamé gaming with outgoing 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.640
 without projections and here the version of 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.100
 zhengzhou I hope this video has 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.900
 served to clarify some doubts 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.170
 see you in another video a greeting to 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.170
 everyone
