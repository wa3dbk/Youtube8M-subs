they<00:00:38.309> find<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> very<00:00:38.940> useful<00:00:39.860> at<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.040> very

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
they find it very useful at the very

least it can be useful to outline what

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
least it can be useful to outline what
you've<00:00:42.989> already<00:00:43.290> done<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> keep

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you've already done so you can keep

you've already done so you can keep
track<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> don't<00:00:45.390> contradict<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
track of it and you don't contradict it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
track of it and you don't contradict it
too<00:00:46.260> much<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.309> rest<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.730> stuff

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
too much in the rest of this stuff

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260 
too much in the rest of this stuff
you're<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:49.160> some<00:00:50.160> people<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.760> an<00:00:50.969> outline

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
you're right some people find an outline

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.959 
you're right some people find an outline
too<00:00:51.930> confining

they have a character and they have a
situation<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.449> write<00:00:57.690> until<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.440> find

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
situation and they write until they find

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
situation and they write until they find
they've<00:00:59.489> developed<00:00:59.850> a<00:01:00.059> problem<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> resolved

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
they've developed a problem and resolved

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.380 
they've developed a problem and resolved
it<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.770> works<00:01:02.039> too<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.940> different<00:01:03.090> people

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it that works too for different people

it that works too for different people
but<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.110> find<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.530> own<00:01:04.680> process
