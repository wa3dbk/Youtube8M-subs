topic by clearing up one of the biggest
misconceptions<00:00:24.550> in<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.970> entire<00:00:25.390> weight<00:00:25.750> loss

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
misconceptions in the entire weight loss

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.109 
misconceptions in the entire weight loss
industry<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.710> that<00:00:26.739> misconception<00:00:27.700> is<00:00:28.000> the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
industry and that misconception is the

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.019 
industry and that misconception is the
fallacy<00:00:28.720> of<00:00:28.750> spot<00:00:29.290> reduction<00:00:29.820> basically<00:00:30.820> what

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
fallacy of spot reduction basically what

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.030 
fallacy of spot reduction basically what
spot<00:00:31.329> reduction<00:00:31.599> implies<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.770> it's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
spot reduction implies is that it's

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.610 
spot reduction implies is that it's
possible<00:00:33.370> for<00:00:33.670> you<00:00:33.970> to<00:00:34.000> target<00:00:34.450> fat<00:00:34.870> loss<00:00:35.140> from

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
possible for you to target fat loss from

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.190 
possible for you to target fat loss from
specific<00:00:36.399> areas<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:36.910> your<00:00:37.000> body<00:00:37.210> by<00:00:37.750> training

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
those areas with resistance the reality

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.560 
those areas with resistance the reality
spot<00:00:41.800> reduction<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.399> completely<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.300> totally

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
spot reduction is completely and totally

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.380 
spot reduction is completely and totally

it sees fit over time you're going to

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.910 
it sees fit over time you're going to
lose<00:01:37.359> fat<00:01:37.630> from<00:01:37.810> your<00:01:37.840> entire<00:01:38.049> body<00:01:38.499> but<00:01:38.799> you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
lose fat from your entire body but you

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.459 
lose fat from your entire body but you
have<00:01:39.100> no<00:01:39.340> control<00:01:39.759> over<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.479> specific<00:01:41.109> areas

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
have no control over the specific areas

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.099 
have no control over the specific areas

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
of your body where fat is pulled from if

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:45.660 
of your body where fat is pulled from if
you've<00:01:44.289> watched<00:01:44.499> any<00:01:44.679> of<00:01:44.799> my<00:01:44.889> video<00:01:45.310> lessons

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you've watched any of my video lessons

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.580 
you've watched any of my video lessons
then<00:01:45.819> you<00:01:45.909> know<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.479> how<00:01:46.630> important<00:01:47.319> weight

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
then you know just how important weight

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590 
then you know just how important weight
training<00:01:48.039> is<00:01:48.159> when<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.639> comes<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:49.030> burning<00:01:49.329> fat

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
training is when it comes to burning fat

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.690 
training is when it comes to burning fat
but<00:01:50.139> if<00:01:50.229> weight<00:01:50.469> training<00:01:50.859> doesn't<00:01:51.069> directly

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
but if weight training doesn't directly

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.309 
but if weight training doesn't directly
burn<00:01:52.030> fat<00:01:52.329> off<00:01:52.539> of<00:01:52.569> the<00:01:52.780> areas<00:01:53.109> that<00:01:53.139> you're

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
burn fat off of the areas that you're

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.069 
burn fat off of the areas that you're
training<00:01:53.770> what's<00:01:54.249> the<00:01:54.399> use<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.579> it<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.749> point

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
training what's the use of it the point

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.629 
training what's the use of it the point
of<00:01:56.200> weight<00:01:56.409> training<00:01:56.799> is<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.069> build<00:01:57.369> and

hamstrings all you're really doing is

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.110 
hamstrings all you're really doing is
stimulating<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> specific<00:02:27.490> muscles<00:02:28.000> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
stimulating the specific muscles that

stimulating the specific muscles that
are<00:02:28.240> involved<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.690> those<00:02:28.810> movements<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.470> that

are involved in those movements and that

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
are involved in those movements and that
muscle<00:02:30.310> will<00:02:30.460> then<00:02:30.640> burn<00:02:30.880> calories<00:02:31.240> all<00:02:31.660> on

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
muscle will then burn calories all on

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.990 
muscle will then burn calories all on
its<00:02:31.960> own<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.830> only<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.070> but<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.490> reasonable

its own not only that but a reasonable
level<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.450> muscular<00:02:34.900> development<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.590> also

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
level of muscular development is also

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.560 
level of muscular development is also
going<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.160> help<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.490> give<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.970> athletic

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
going to help to give you that athletic

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.270 
going to help to give you that athletic

lean sculpted body that you're probably
after<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.990> might<00:02:41.170> ask<00:02:41.350> well<00:02:41.590> how<00:02:41.650> do

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
after so then you might ask well how do

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.310 
after so then you might ask well how do

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
body well flex your bicep and look down

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.750 
body well flex your bicep and look down
at<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.320> what<00:02:47.770> are<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:47.920> seeing<00:02:48.190> two<00:02:48.730> different

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
at it what are you seeing two different

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.720 
at it what are you seeing two different
tissues<00:02:49.420> fat<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.290> muscle<00:02:50.710> the<00:02:51.370> muscles

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
tissues fat and muscle the muscles

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.130 
tissues fat and muscle the muscles
underneath<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.360> there's<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.570> layer<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.810> body

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
underneath and there's a layer of body

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.680 
underneath and there's a layer of body
fat<00:02:53.350> sitting<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.770> top<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.580> goal<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.820> toning<00:02:55.600> or

fat sitting on top the goal of toning or

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.630 
fat sitting on top the goal of toning or
defining<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.350> sculpting<00:02:56.860> your<00:02:56.980> bicep<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.610> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
defining or sculpting your bicep is a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.850 
defining or sculpting your bicep is a
simple<00:02:58.180> matter<00:02:58.210> of<00:02:58.600> reducing<00:02:58.960> the<00:02:59.500> layer<00:02:59.710> of

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
simple matter of reducing the layer of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.410 
simple matter of reducing the layer of
fat<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.250> sitting<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.670> top<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.180> muscle

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
fat that is sitting on top of the muscle

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.270 
fat that is sitting on top of the muscle
so<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.170> muscle<00:03:02.500> underneath<00:03:02.740> becomes

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
so that the muscle underneath becomes

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.910 
so that the muscle underneath becomes
more<00:03:03.490> visible<00:03:03.990> so<00:03:04.990> let<00:03:05.140> me<00:03:05.260> state<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.560> again

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
more visible so let me state this again

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.340 
more visible so let me state this again
