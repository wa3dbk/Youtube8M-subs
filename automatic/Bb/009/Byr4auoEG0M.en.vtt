was<00:02:10.520> like<00:02:10.670> something's<00:02:11.030> missing<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:12.410> just

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
was like something's missing this just

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.350 
was like something's missing this just
doesn't<00:02:12.770> feel<00:02:12.920> right<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.550> threw<00:02:14.210> together

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
doesn't feel right and I threw together

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.470 
doesn't feel right and I threw together
a<00:02:14.960> very<00:02:15.740> lackluster<00:02:16.010> arrangement<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.270> then

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
a very lackluster arrangement and then

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.300 
a very lackluster arrangement and then
went<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.750> guitar<00:02:17.960> part<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.470> there<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:18.980> then

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
went to a guitar part on there and then

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.520 
went to a guitar part on there and then
some<00:02:19.520> backup<00:02:19.850> vocals<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.380> know<00:02:21.470> I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
some backup vocals and then you know I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.350 
some backup vocals and then you know I
made<00:02:21.680> some<00:02:21.740> tweaks<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.520> arrangement<00:02:22.880> and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
made some tweaks to that arrangement and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.500 
made some tweaks to that arrangement and
the<00:02:24.200> final<00:02:24.650> product<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:25.700> something

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the final product was something

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.380 
the final product was something
completely<00:02:26.720> light-years<00:02:27.590> away<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:28.760> where

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
completely light-years away then where

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.820 
completely light-years away then where
the<00:02:29.510> song<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.140> night<00:02:30.290> before<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.770> I

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
the song was the night before and I

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.790 
the song was the night before and I
think<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.940> watching<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.990> song<00:02:33.620> in

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
think that just watching that song in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.820 
think that just watching that song in
particular<00:02:33.920> grow<00:02:34.610> from<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.840> song<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.620> I

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
particular grow from a song that I

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.100 
particular grow from a song that I
didn't<00:02:37.250> really<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:37.460> as<00:02:37.760> much<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.240> throwing

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
didn't really like as much and throwing

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.060 
didn't really like as much and throwing
it<00:02:39.260> way<00:02:40.480> forward<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.470> pack<00:02:42.710> in<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
it way forward in in the pack in the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.490 
it way forward in in the pack in the
tracklist<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.670> for<00:02:43.910> me<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.960> was<00:02:45.080> definitely<00:02:45.230> a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
tracklist and for me it was definitely a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.170 
tracklist and for me it was definitely a
highlight<00:02:45.710> because<00:02:46.250> hearing<00:02:47.030> that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
highlight because hearing that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.880 
highlight because hearing that
arrangement<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:47.840> being<00:02:48.050> really<00:02:48.650> proud<00:02:48.830> of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
arrangement and being really proud of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.070 
arrangement and being really proud of
where<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.250> song<00:02:49.520> ended<00:02:49.880> up<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.270> knowing

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
where that song ended up and knowing

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.979 
where that song ended up and knowing
that<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:52.100> didn't<00:02:52.370> enjoy<00:02:52.790> that<00:02:52.820> song<00:02:53.390> as<00:02:53.570> much<00:02:53.810> as

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
that I didn't enjoy that song as much as

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.570 
that I didn't enjoy that song as much as
the<00:02:54.110> other<00:02:54.260> songs<00:02:54.530> before<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:55.250> think

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the other songs before I think

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.840 
the other songs before I think
definitely<00:02:55.910> was<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.209> highlight<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.570> me
