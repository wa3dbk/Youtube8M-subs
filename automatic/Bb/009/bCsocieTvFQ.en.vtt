00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
hello you would do celebrate the metal

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.510 
hello you would do celebrate the metal
here<00:00:13.240> and<00:00:13.840> I<00:00:13.930> recently<00:00:14.289> got<00:00:14.740> this<00:00:14.949> battery

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
here and I recently got this battery

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.120 
here and I recently got this battery
backup<00:00:16.029> because<00:00:16.630> when<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.199> power<00:00:17.440> flickers

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
backup because when the power flickers

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.550 
backup because when the power flickers
and<00:00:18.160> sometimes<00:00:18.789> it<00:00:18.970> does<00:00:19.180> in<00:00:19.390> my<00:00:19.420> rural<00:00:19.930> area

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
and sometimes it does in my rural area

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.579 
and sometimes it does in my rural area
here<00:00:21.070> then<00:00:21.970> sometimes<00:00:22.750> peril<00:00:23.140> goes<00:00:23.259> up<00:00:23.410> my

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
here then sometimes peril goes up my

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.130 
here then sometimes peril goes up my
computer<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.189> shut<00:00:24.220> down<00:00:24.490> so<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.720> know<00:00:25.869> what<00:00:26.109> I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
computer is shut down so you know what I

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.529 
computer is shut down so you know what I
decided<00:00:26.679> to<00:00:26.829> give<00:00:27.009> this<00:00:27.160> battery<00:00:27.699> back<00:00:28.060> up<00:00:28.089> and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
decided to give this battery back up and

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.960 
decided to give this battery back up and
plug<00:00:29.109> all<00:00:29.410> my<00:00:29.560> devices<00:00:29.890> into<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.579> so<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.849> when

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
plug all my devices into it so that when

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.270 
plug all my devices into it so that when
the<00:00:31.029> power<00:00:31.210> goes<00:00:31.329> out<00:00:31.689> well<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.800> have<00:00:33.010> enough

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
the power goes out well I have enough

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.370 
the power goes out well I have enough
time<00:00:33.489> to<00:00:33.550> shut<00:00:33.970> down<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.329> computer<00:00:34.450> properly

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
time to shut down the computer properly

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.650 
time to shut down the computer properly
and<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:37.120> as<00:00:37.330> it<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.750> with<00:00:38.170> silver<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.660> silver

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
and just as it is with silver and silver

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.150 
and just as it is with silver and silver
and<00:00:41.050> gold<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:42.850> are<00:00:43.120> like<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:43.330> battery<00:00:43.780> backup

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and gold also are like a battery backup

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.340 
and gold also are like a battery backup
yes<00:00:45.160> I<00:00:45.460> know<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.360> bit<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.660> a<00:00:46.780> stretch<00:00:47.080> of<00:00:47.110> an

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
yes I know it's a bit of a stretch of an

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.130 
yes I know it's a bit of a stretch of an
analogy<00:00:47.860> but<00:00:48.040> think<00:00:48.280> about<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.670> this<00:00:48.880> way

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
analogy but think about it this way

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.230 
analogy but think about it this way
especially<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.430> prices<00:00:51.700> are<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.210> low

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
especially when the prices are so low

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.310 
especially when the prices are so low
right<00:00:52.690> now<00:00:53.490> you<00:00:54.490> know<00:00:54.610> so<00:00:55.090> far<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.720> dollar<00:00:55.990> is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
right now you know so far the dollar is

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.040 
right now you know so far the dollar is
the<00:00:56.530> best<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.160> worst<00:00:57.370> in<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.360> economy<00:00:58.900> as

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
the best of the worst in the economy as

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.560 
the best of the worst in the economy as
far<00:00:59.290> as<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.530> currencies<00:00:59.980> are<00:01:00.130> concerned<00:01:00.670> but

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
far as the currencies are concerned but

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.679 
far as the currencies are concerned but
all<00:01:02.080> major<00:01:02.710> government's<00:01:03.460> own<00:01:03.700> gold<00:01:04.420> and

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689

silver um especially gold as a reserve
and<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.759> just<00:01:09.759> like<00:01:10.090> me<00:01:10.479> with<00:01:10.689> my

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
and the like and just like me with my

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.649 
and the like and just like me with my
computers<00:01:11.350> my<00:01:11.560> battery<00:01:11.950> backup<00:01:12.490> here<00:01:12.820> I'm

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
computers my battery backup here I'm

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.510 
computers my battery backup here I'm
going<00:01:14.079> to<00:01:14.549> use<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.469> in<00:01:17.859> place

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
going to use it and have it in place

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.620 
going to use it and have it in place
here<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.439> we'll<00:01:20.439> charge<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.950> up<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.569> have<00:01:22.569> it

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
here and we'll charge it up and have it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260 
here and we'll charge it up and have it
in<00:01:22.929> case<00:01:23.200> my<00:01:23.499> power<00:01:23.829> goes<00:01:24.219> down<00:01:24.249> then<00:01:24.999> it<00:01:25.149> will

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
in case my power goes down then it will

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.569 
in case my power goes down then it will
become<00:01:25.390> quite<00:01:25.990> necessary<00:01:26.200> for<00:01:26.890> me<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.039> run<00:01:27.340> now

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
become quite necessary for me to run now

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.120 
become quite necessary for me to run now
let's<00:01:27.819> say<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:28.420> six<00:01:28.719> months<00:01:29.229> there's<00:01:29.920> no

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
let's say for six months there's no

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.209 
let's say for six months there's no
spikes<00:01:30.609> or<00:01:30.999> there's<00:01:31.299> no<00:01:31.859> interruptions<00:01:32.859> in<00:01:33.039> my

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
spikes or there's no interruptions in my

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.760 
spikes or there's no interruptions in my
power<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:34.689> what<00:01:35.560> will<00:01:35.770> happen<00:01:35.799> is<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.770> will

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
power then what will happen is I will

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.039 
power then what will happen is I will
never<00:01:38.920> know<00:01:39.159> what's<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.639> and<00:01:39.999> it<00:01:40.899> will

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
never know what's there and it will

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.809 
never know what's there and it will
essentially<00:01:41.380> be<00:01:41.530> worthless<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.399> me<00:01:42.429> because

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
essentially be worthless to me because

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.239 
essentially be worthless to me because
the<00:01:43.270> power<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.689> constantly<00:01:44.439> streaming<00:01:44.499> into

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
the power is constantly streaming into

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.449 
the power is constantly streaming into
my<00:01:45.399> home<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:47.020> which<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.409> can<00:01:47.469> draw<00:01:47.799> on<00:01:48.039> to

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
my home from which I can draw on to

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.489 
my home from which I can draw on to
power<00:01:48.639> my<00:01:48.909> computers<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.749> comment<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.319> your

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
power my computers and comment on your

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.499 
power my computers and comment on your
videos<00:01:50.979> on<00:01:51.340> YouTube<00:01:51.959> so<00:01:52.959> what<00:01:53.439> happens<00:01:53.950> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
videos on YouTube so what happens is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.029 
videos on YouTube so what happens is
when<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.630> power<00:01:55.840> goes<00:01:55.990> out<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.740> becomes

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
when the power goes out then it becomes

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.539 
when the power goes out then it becomes
very<00:01:57.130> valuable<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.030> me<00:01:58.149> because<00:01:58.329> it<00:01:58.630> beeps<00:01:58.899> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
very valuable to me because it beeps and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.010 
very valuable to me because it beeps and
that<00:02:00.549> beep<00:02:00.819> lets<00:02:01.149> me<00:02:01.329> know<00:02:01.509> that<00:02:01.539> it<00:02:01.869> is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
that beep lets me know that it is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.160 
that beep lets me know that it is
running<00:02:02.499> and<00:02:02.709> then<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:03.909> can<00:02:04.179> have<00:02:04.209> time<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.929> shut

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
running and then I can have time to shut

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.620 
running and then I can have time to shut
my<00:02:05.319> computer's<00:02:05.799> down<00:02:05.950> properly<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.909> the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
my computer's down properly and the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.949 
my computer's down properly and the
right<00:02:07.810> manner<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.890> as<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.550> case<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:10.390> silver

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
right manner so as the case with silver

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.899 
right manner so as the case with silver
and<00:02:11.140> gold<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.299> I'm<00:02:13.299> talking<00:02:13.810> strictly<00:02:14.110> from<00:02:14.590> a

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
and gold and I'm talking strictly from a

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.210 
and gold and I'm talking strictly from a
hedging<00:02:15.909> purpose<00:02:16.390> because<00:02:17.319> I<00:02:17.530> had

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
hedging purpose because I had

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580 
hedging purpose because I had
my<00:02:18.340> power<00:02:18.640> bet<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.840> when<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.110> goes<00:02:20.290> down<00:02:20.320> I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
my power bet but when it goes down I

a battery backup of silver and that's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.840 
a battery backup of silver and that's
how<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.930> look<00:03:35.500> at<00:03:35.709> my<00:03:35.890> collection<00:03:36.519> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
how I like to look at my collection and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.210 
how I like to look at my collection and
it<00:03:37.420> gives<00:03:37.630> me<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> justification<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.800> may<00:03:39.010> be<00:03:39.070> a

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
it gives me a justification it may be a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.220 
it gives me a justification it may be a
captain<00:03:39.550> obvious<00:03:39.850> situation<00:03:40.300> for<00:03:40.930> some<00:03:41.080> of

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230

captain obvious situation for some of
you<00:03:41.320> out<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.130> figured<00:03:42.610> I'd

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
you out there but I just figured I'd

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.690 
you out there but I just figured I'd
throw<00:03:42.760> out<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.300> interesting<00:03:43.810> analogy

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
throw out this interesting analogy

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.310 
throw out this interesting analogy
because<00:03:45.700> if<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.239> think<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.600> it<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.080> an

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
because if you think about it it is an

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.130 
because if you think about it it is an
insurance<00:03:47.830> policy<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:48.850> does<00:03:49.390> give<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.840> power

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
insurance policy it does give you power
