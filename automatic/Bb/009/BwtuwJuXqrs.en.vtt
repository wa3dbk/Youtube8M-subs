to make the first style of candy cane
with<00:00:57.050> two<00:00:57.350> equal<00:00:57.920> stripes<00:00:58.310> on<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.880> I'm<00:00:59.390> taking

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
with two equal stripes on it I'm taking

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.720 
with two equal stripes on it I'm taking
some<00:01:00.140> red<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.560> green<00:01:00.800> clay<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.400> you're<00:01:01.580> going

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
some red and green clay and you're going

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.700 
some red and green clay and you're going
to<00:01:01.790> roll<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.120> into<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.570> little<00:01:02.960> snake<00:01:03.170> like<00:01:03.470> so

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
to roll it into a little snake like so

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.590 
to roll it into a little snake like so
and<00:01:03.980> you<00:01:04.370> want<00:01:04.520> to<00:01:04.610> make<00:01:04.699> sure<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:04.970> it's<00:01:05.330> much

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
and you want to make sure that it's much

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.170 
and you want to make sure that it's much
much<00:01:05.900> thinner<00:01:06.229> than<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.979> middle<00:01:07.310> log<00:01:07.550> and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
much thinner than the middle log and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.730 
much thinner than the middle log and
then<00:01:08.300> you're<00:01:08.420> just<00:01:08.450> going<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.960> cut<00:01:09.200> two<00:01:09.530> pieces

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
then you're just going to cut two pieces

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.530 
then you're just going to cut two pieces
that<00:01:10.130> are<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.340> same<00:01:10.490> length<00:01:10.820> as<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.210> center

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
that are the same length as the center

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.660 
that are the same length as the center
core<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.050> then<00:01:12.770> what<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.070> want<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.280> do<00:01:13.460> is

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
core and then what you want to do is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.010 
core and then what you want to do is
you're<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.090> stick<00:01:14.330> these<00:01:14.509> two<00:01:14.810> on

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
you're going to stick these two on

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.390 
you're going to stick these two on
opposite<00:01:15.590> sides<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.310> center

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.810 

Oh

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.980 

then<00:01:30.820> you're<00:01:30.969> going<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.210> take<00:01:31.299> your<00:01:31.450> second

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
then you're going to take your second

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.810 
then you're going to take your second
color<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.560> again<00:01:32.860> roll<00:01:33.070> it<00:01:33.250> into<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.610> same

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
color and again roll it into the same

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.779 
color and again roll it into the same
kind<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.360> little<00:01:35.140> snakes<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.920> trim<00:01:36.460> them<00:01:36.640> to

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
kind of little snakes and trim them to

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.520 
kind of little snakes and trim them to
size<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.659> then<00:01:37.810> you're<00:01:37.929> going<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.140> put<00:01:38.350> them

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
size and then you're going to put them

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.499 
size and then you're going to put them
directly<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.399> center<00:01:39.579> in<00:01:39.909> between<00:01:40.329> the

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
directly in the center in between the

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.389 
directly in the center in between the
first<00:01:40.750> color<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.530> can<00:01:41.710> use<00:01:41.829> any<00:01:42.070> kind<00:01:42.159> of

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
you're just going to flatten them ever

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.600 
you're just going to flatten them ever
so<00:02:02.050> slightly<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.680> core<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.100> then<00:02:03.280> start

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
so slightly to the core and then start

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.580 
so slightly to the core and then start
rolling<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.270> every<00:02:04.870> now<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.170> then<00:02:05.290> between

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
just go ahead and twist it slightly to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.360 
just go ahead and twist it slightly to
get<00:02:10.900> the<00:02:11.020> pattern<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> like<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.250> can

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
for the second style of the candy cane

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.780 
for the second style of the candy cane
you're<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.770> begin<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.310> same<00:02:41.520> kind

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you're going to begin with the same kind

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
you're going to begin with the same kind
of<00:02:41.940> white<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.390> translucent<00:02:43.140> core<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.709> then

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
of white and translucent core and then

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.800 
of white and translucent core and then
you're<00:02:44.069> also<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.670> do<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.180> two<00:02:45.420> thicker

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810

you're also going to do the two thicker
red<00:02:46.200> stripes<00:02:46.680> or<00:02:46.980> whatever<00:02:47.160> color<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.700> you

three much more thinner logs and the
easiest<00:02:55.920> way<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.069> place<00:02:56.430> them<00:02:56.640> onto<00:02:56.819> your<00:02:57.060> core

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
easiest way to place them onto your core

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.090 
easiest way to place them onto your core
is<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.780> just<00:02:57.959> attach<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.560> middle<00:02:58.890> one

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
is to just attach the middle one

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.070 
is to just attach the middle one
directly<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.880> between<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.360> two<00:03:00.540> red<00:03:00.810> pieces

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
directly in between the two red pieces

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.380 
directly in between the two red pieces
as<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.770> there<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:03.000> put<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
as I have there and then just put the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.300 
as I have there and then just put the
other<00:03:03.510> two<00:03:03.780> thin<00:03:04.020> one<00:03:04.200> ever<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.860> slightly<00:03:05.160> to

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
other two thin one ever so slightly to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.509 
other two thin one ever so slightly to
either<00:03:05.580> side<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.270> your<00:03:07.110> thin<00:03:07.440> pink<00:03:07.770> one<00:03:13.519> then

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
either side of your thin pink one then

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.680 
either side of your thin pink one then
you're<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.700> got<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.060> make<00:03:15.150> sure<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.540> you

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
you're just got to make sure that you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.300 
you're just got to make sure that you
have<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.870> same<00:03:16.200> pattern<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> other<00:03:17.040> side

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
have the same pattern on the other side

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800 
have the same pattern on the other side
and<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.820> go<00:03:18.000> ahead<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.239> start<00:03:18.600> rolling

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and you can go ahead and start rolling

00:03:18.810 --> 00:04:03.090 
and you can go ahead and start rolling
in<00:03:19.140> twisting<00:03:19.500> your<00:03:19.590> cane

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.490 

and<00:04:03.580> as<00:04:04.300> you<00:04:04.420> can<00:04:04.570> hopefully<00:04:04.750> see<00:04:04.990> here<00:04:05.380> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and as you can hopefully see here the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.290 
and as you can hopefully see here the
pattern<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.100> creates<00:04:06.490> is<00:04:06.670> one<00:04:06.910> thick

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
pattern that this creates is one thick

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.090 
pattern that this creates is one thick
stripe<00:04:07.660> across<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.380> then<00:04:08.470> three<00:04:08.800> thin

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
stripe across and then three thin

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.220 
stripe across and then three thin
stripes<00:04:09.520> as<00:04:09.760> well<00:04:09.940> then<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:10.630> can<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:10.990> roll

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
stripes as well then you can just roll

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.380 
stripes as well then you can just roll
A's<00:04:11.380> into<00:04:11.650> any<00:04:11.830> kind<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.220> size<00:04:12.460> or<00:04:12.850> thickness

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
A's into any kind of size or thickness

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.860 
A's into any kind of size or thickness
