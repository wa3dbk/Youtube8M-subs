 they have been warmly welcomed 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.569
 the always laden in despite the fact that they really don't have a lot of people 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.249
 I have a good feeling about it 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.279
 for you the most impressive 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.279
 although the economy is all about research 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.009
 for example, on a normal day two young people three sentences of people in the tub 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.649
 3 trillion 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.649
 twenty million people are the cards 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.230
 NRC boy turned into auto mode that still made some people live 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 to be happy 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.850
 I don't have to think about it, quite frankly 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.200
 this now there is a file but so you see all those people the virus it is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.590
 here just happy to know his life an heirloom would take place vitens the app 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
 empty time that appears in the way so terrible 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.950
 media you have to accept that 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 sparta Dutch who work 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.320
 distance of six kilometers per year five minutes 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.340
 but I only have two left 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.960
 that is the paepe so many sponsorship activities obligations 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.470
 not in bizz signature sessions hour 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050
 how did they fall a bit 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.120
 yes look well see you can also just say to hang in the room 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.960
 the swimming pool 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 now activities 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 and I think it is best of three loss especially in the beginning 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.350
 there was smoke coming from the day tourists with a bit of going away 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.060
 to work 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.680
 That was of course the intention in the line 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.780
 That it's for the sake of sponsorship is one all 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 bilthoven put the name ajax on the map again and then you see what ajax sees 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.520
 best we still live in many cases 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.350
 of course most people know 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380
 the generation of the jap tribe 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.410

 in mind every year guidetti that success anyway if you do 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.640

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.900

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.289
 you have many young boys with you 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.379

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.989

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.639

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.789

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:37.539

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.479
 even you too 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.499
 winning is wonderfully casual setting, just the young talents 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.629
 just be able to show in the group what is being asked or not 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.409
 is that such a on the other hand for example one 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.429
 I think you can generate pain 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.039
 peter leeuwenburgh
