00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 Hello, my beloved ones, all registered well with 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.530
 You here the speaker is the magnifying glass and this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.049
 battle there was mine against the vini one of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.990
 we started by placing 2 thousand already 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.539
 plot to face the two stayed there 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.519
 rolling the first rounds of battle 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.490
 using substitute protect until 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.640
 I started beating a little on it it 's already cleaned 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.309
 He lost a lot of life but gave 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.430
 to defeat him only with injusazine then 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.590
 That I thought good I'll get mine on the jasc 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 I'm going to put something on this fight. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.600
 who can defeat the ija 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.300
 I did not vote in the field for my 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.309
 fly and you'll see what 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 This happened, there's the hint then to 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 you a technique to end the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.500
 pokémon that they are curling using 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.059
 substitute put my flying mega 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.789
 and see she's just going to use an attack now 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.680
 who will get a jazz that just behind 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 substitute I think my opponent does not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 realized that I would do this is important 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.409
 continued using solids inside and used the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
 ray attack which is an attack that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.229
 pierce the substitute so to speak 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.210
 huh 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.689
 take the pokemon anyway 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.990
 get it back thanks to the hype voice 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 came into the field a mega qantas khan is a 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.799
 very powerful pokémon would be a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.680
 big danger for me in the mega of flying, right? 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.840
 but see I used the voice ip again from a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 very strong damage an attack 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.799
 very strong and how I now owe it to her 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.229
 turns all normal attacks into 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.780
 fairy type attacks ipods that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.409
 usually normal is with her in the type 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 fairy and then she can make an attack 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.000
 hysterical that deals a lot of damage then 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.360
 so that manage to defeat the nec 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 if he had a snake friend of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.420
 ball had already been defeated and 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.490
 My crew of flying against a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 Content logical that she fell in 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.500
 The truth is that it is very strong until 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 was smart to use 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.340
 because if he had used 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.110
 some other attack on my denying to fly 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.540
 would have given a good rating on him or 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.200
 using any psychic attack 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.230
 huh 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 I used it in the safe with Holland time. 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.800
 to try to get the content of any 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 defensive item he had and then I 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.250
 I discovered that he did not have any 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.160
 item was with soft being that item 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.620
 quite useless for content so 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.410
 say and gave little damage so it was kind 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.090
 that decision that I took had 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.570
 It would have been much better if I had 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.000
 dude an effect that was what i did there 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.880
 Are you seeing or were you able to give 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.400
 enough damage content even talking 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.900
 a pokémon quite a book not because not 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.580
 has plenty of special defense I used 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.690
 once more we will see now what goes 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.410
 to happen 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.290
 went to the floor the contents of vinnie 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.270
 able to defeat him and angle ct 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.700
 stayed a little bit in the field a lot 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.680
 People think lanus is a pokémon 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.769
 considered uber because it is legendary 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.280
 but not the light landu in their physical form 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.860
 he is considered or heard of it accepted 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.430
 in the rules of the good smo né they saw used 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.440
 back in the pants and took non-toxic board 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.450
 glass so it's very important to 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.880
 to end glass's strategy by 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.250
 fla sport's strategy comes from the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.950
 fact that he will rather poison and stay 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.290
 recovering life with a subtle touch but 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.940
 How did I get out of him? 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.459
 will be able to make a living 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.620
 blairo's strategy went to the bag there 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.230
 it's much easier to defeat him or 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.680
 I used that nerd is an attack of the type 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.660
 stone and therefore gives good damage 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.709
 against glass were the same but already 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.510
 You lost half your life and you're short 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.090
 defeat him as if they are seeing the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.930
 langur us okay enduring the beatings 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.930
 who is taking the ex global né by 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.880
 but it 's still difficult right leandro 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.880
 failed to give as good damage so 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.350
 was not round and then it fell 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.599
 I had to think fast about 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.450
 thing to raise him that I decided to put the 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.830
 zango use pokémon that I love in my 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.710
 list 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 bonis of 2011 I thought it would defeat the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.669
 neighborhood like a shuttlecock I was mistaken 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.770
 very foolish anglais for survived and 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.500
 with a little bit of life and 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.620
 He still protected the next shift, right? 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.870
 let my brother take the damage 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.629
 poisoning he took the touch become 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.280
 my friends have a skill that gives 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.120
 more attack on him when he is 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.490
 poisoned 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.580
 so it helps a lot himself 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.310
 so I managed to defeat the goias for 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.979
 then chop up again using 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.360
 so it seemed a good idea to have used 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.530
 because the second shift technique despite 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.719
 that if I had given any other 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.190
 attack in the first round maybe already 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.569
 will have defeated 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.449
 legislative good used 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.250
 He insisted he protected the attack on 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.830
 my pokémon and not only protect how much 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.289
 to reduce my attack which was very bad 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.139
 me just taking my friends and to 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.080
 he would lose it anyway. 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.699
 cause of toxik he had taken from item 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.190
 that he was carrying himself to 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:32.500
 increase his attack right I returned the 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.409
 content thinking he would make a good 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.690
 work against weggis lech mas 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.180
 took off shadows nick is here to 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.969
 bag type iort an attack that 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.210
 usually will attack first but I will 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:48.639
 I got a night attack there against 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.400
 weggis east and defeated him from any 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.849
 so he could not resist the attack 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.099
 of my dropped content goes into the field 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.789
 grane since he is an extremely pokémon 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.860
 speedy a kind the super tek to which 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.569
 all their attacks are stebe is by 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.060
 the guild is already widely used in the 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.979
 competitive in doubt let the coach 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.129
 the staff is choosing for the group already 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.169
 even there I put a reimplantation him but 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.810
 I was very silly I did not realize 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.089
 that he could have extra sensory that 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.460
 gives a super effective attack on my 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:24.940
 content was what he did right my content 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.699
 suffered almost fell and then I can not 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.139
 to overthrow the guild never an uprising that 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.050
 I gave up after the client ended 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.180
 defeating my content on my computer 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.580
 only survived so much 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.710
 using southwest is increasing the 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.860
 species or defects 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.289
 I returned in the new field to jasc there 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.449
 try to do something against 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.570
 guild and I stayed around a while there 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.850
 using the protect substitute until I 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.830
 It fills me with curling up and 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.350
 against the club we mess around 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.380
 my opponent just for fun and an ex 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.139
 Styrofoam that to my surprise was 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.550
 criticized and overthrew the 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.979
 was critical I think the guild already 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.139
 would have survived and it was this critic 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.270
 Who saved me, I just won Sunday. 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.380
 in this battle that was very exciting 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.000
 did you like it 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.770
 I hope so, do not forget to give a 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.410
 young man had hedge in this favorite video 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.780
 always return the mystery papers that more 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.800
 pokémon's videos appeared around 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.690
 beauty 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.280
 was a strong embrace of profit until the 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.280
 next single video
