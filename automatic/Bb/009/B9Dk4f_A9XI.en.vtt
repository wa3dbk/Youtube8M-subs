00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
doing having a look at doing docs to

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.589 
doing having a look at doing docs to
stock<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:07.740> as<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.950> starts<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> dogs

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
stock so as it starts to the dogs

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.499 
stock so as it starts to the dogs
dogster<00:00:09.599> stocks<00:00:10.639> right<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.059> first<00:00:12.240> part<00:00:12.480> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
dogster stocks right the first part of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
dogster stocks right the first part of
this<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.809> really<00:00:12.960> easy<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
this was really easy and just have to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.310 
this was really easy and just have to
get<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> cargo<00:00:15.089> Bob<00:00:15.330> no<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:16.109> it'd<00:00:16.289> be

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
get a cargo Bob no I thought it'd be

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
get a cargo Bob no I thought it'd be
really<00:00:16.529> difficult<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> army<00:00:17.670> base<00:00:17.850> but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
really difficult in the army base but

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
really difficult in the army base but
there<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.260> two<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.439> them<00:00:19.529> park<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
there was two of them park right the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.519 
there was two of them park right the
entrance<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.670> about<00:00:20.939> now<00:00:21.539> obviously<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
entrance just about now obviously that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.529 
entrance just about now obviously that
got<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> four-star<00:00:23.400> wanted<00:00:23.789> rating<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.420> have

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
got a four-star wanted rating so we have

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.910 
got a four-star wanted rating so we have
a<00:00:24.570> bit<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.900> fight<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.260> our<00:00:25.289> hands<00:00:25.560> trying<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
a bit of a fight on our hands trying to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.839 
a bit of a fight on our hands trying to
get<00:00:26.070> rid<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.369> guys<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> yeah<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.980> brought

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
get rid of these guys so yeah we brought

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.350 
get rid of these guys so yeah we brought
out<00:00:30.090> both<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> cargo<00:00:31.679> Bob's<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.059> case

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
out both of the cargo Bob's just in case

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.380 
out both of the cargo Bob's just in case
and<00:00:34.250> bigger<00:00:35.250> because<00:00:35.610> people<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.149> flying

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and bigger because people like flying

stuff I guess cuz it's fun ah so yeah
first<00:00:41.219> part<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> mission<00:00:42.410> relatively<00:00:43.410> easy<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
first part of mission relatively easy a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.500 
first part of mission relatively easy a
little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> time<00:00:44.820> consuming<00:00:46.640> although<00:00:47.640> at

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
little bit of time consuming although at

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
little bit of time consuming although at
one<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.079> had<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.680> four

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
one point I had like about four

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.220 
one point I had like about four
helicopters<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.820> least<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.420> me<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:54.230> and

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
helicopters at least on me that was and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.600 
helicopters at least on me that was and
I<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.559> wasn't<00:00:55.949> looking<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I would just wasn't looking on that you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.099 
I would just wasn't looking on that you
can<00:00:56.760> see<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.539> wasn't

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
can see here you know it just wasn't

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
can see here you know it just wasn't
looking<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.940> although<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.149> locking<00:01:00.390> on

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
looking on although it was locking on

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
looking on although it was locking on
but<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> Rockets<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.800> still<00:01:01.949> just

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
but you know the Rockets was still just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
but you know the Rockets was still just
kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> gone<00:01:02.489> way<00:01:03.090> past<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.690> now

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
kind of gone way past them now

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.289 
kind of gone way past them now
personally<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.189> haven't<00:01:05.580> had<00:01:05.729> much<00:01:05.909> look<00:01:06.180> at

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
personally I haven't had much look at

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.640 
personally I haven't had much look at
the<00:01:06.360> machine<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> find<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.530> know

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the machine but I find that you know

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.850 
the machine but I find that you know
it's<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> erratic<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.560> flying<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's so erratic the flying and the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's so erratic the flying and the
target<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.780> haven't<00:01:13.049> had<00:01:13.140> much

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
target in that I just haven't had much

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.210 
target in that I just haven't had much
luck<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.939> I'd<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> curious<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.220> usual

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
luck so I'd be curious to know as usual

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
luck so I'd be curious to know as usual
I<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.970> other<00:01:18.000> people's<00:01:18.450> experiences

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I have what other people's experiences

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.490 
I have what other people's experiences
are<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.790> whether<00:01:20.790> you've<00:01:21.000> had<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.330> joy<00:01:22.290> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
are and whether you've had any joy in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
are and whether you've had any joy in
using<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.610> machine<00:01:23.909> guns<00:01:24.119> rather<00:01:24.509> than<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
using the machine guns rather than the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.460 
using the machine guns rather than the
lock<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.290> rockets<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.869> was<00:01:28.049> probably<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
lock on rockets this was probably the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
lock on rockets this was probably the
hardest<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> mission<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.729> fact<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hardest bit of the mission in fact you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.010 
hardest bit of the mission in fact you
know<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:30.960> saying<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.229> wasn't<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> hard<00:01:33.020> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
know I'm saying it wasn't that hard but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
know I'm saying it wasn't that hard but
realistically<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.650> four<00:01:34.890> star<00:01:35.159> chase<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
realistically a four star chase can be a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.380 
realistically a four star chase can be a
bit<00:01:36.479> difficult<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.140> away<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.380> sometimes

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.950 

especially<00:01:41.390> if<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.570> fly<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:42.020> me<00:01:43.719> now<00:01:44.719> I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
especially if you fly like me now I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.959 
especially if you fly like me now I
entirely<00:01:45.560> blame<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.009> police<00:01:46.249> for<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:46.609> crash

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
entirely blame the police for that crash

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.919 
entirely blame the police for that crash
there<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:48.109> was<00:01:48.229> entirely<00:01:48.560> his<00:01:48.829> fault<00:01:49.929> look

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
there that was entirely his fault look

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.340 
there that was entirely his fault look
at<00:01:51.049> how<00:01:51.140> many<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:51.530> miss<00:01:51.710> him<00:01:51.859> I<00:01:53.229> think<00:01:54.229> it

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
at how many you just miss him I think it

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.649 
at how many you just miss him I think it
starts<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.679> pick<00:01:54.829> up<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.100> bit<00:01:55.280> here<00:01:55.459> though<00:01:55.659> yeah

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
starts to pick up a bit here though yeah

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:14.800 
starts to pick up a bit here though yeah
boom<00:01:57.140> baby<00:01:59.799> boom<00:02:00.799> baby<00:02:05.500> bye-bye<00:02:09.700> ciao<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:13.810> yeah

boom baby boom baby bye-bye ciao so yeah
once<00:02:15.079> I've<00:02:15.260> done<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.890> lambda<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.430> well

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
going to go to the compound and this is

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.399 
going to go to the compound and this is
where<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.159> cargo<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.549> going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.849> be<00:03:31.939> at<00:03:32.409> now

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
where the cargo is going to be at now

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.860 
where the cargo is going to be at now
when<00:03:33.950> i<00:03:33.980> start<00:03:34.459> flying<00:03:34.730> towards<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.329> i<00:03:35.510> start

when i start flying towards it i start

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.839 
when i start flying towards it i start
locking<00:03:36.290> onto<00:03:36.530> enemies<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.280> thought<00:03:37.489> well

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
locking onto enemies so I thought well

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.819 
locking onto enemies so I thought well
I'll<00:03:38.150> get<00:03:38.359> rid<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.599> those<00:03:38.780> enemies<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.680> can

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.619 
I'll get rid of those enemies you can
see<00:03:39.980> here<00:03:40.219> now<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:43.400> straight<00:03:44.239> away<00:03:44.269> I've<00:03:44.540> got

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
see here now and straight away I've got

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.099 
see here now and straight away I've got
another<00:03:44.840> three<00:03:45.169> style<00:03:45.469> wanted<00:03:45.799> rain<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:47.109> it

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
another three style wanted rain so it

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.629 
another three style wanted rain so it
turns<00:03:48.319> out<00:03:48.500> what<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.829> have<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.159> actually<00:03:49.340> do

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
turns out what you have to actually do

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.979 
turns out what you have to actually do
is<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:51.349> have<00:03:51.620> your<00:03:51.799> rating<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.689> just<00:03:53.689> fly

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
is not have your rating and just fly

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.899 
is not have your rating and just fly
over<00:03:54.019> that<00:03:54.530> compound<00:03:55.129> bit<00:03:55.340> or<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.519> know<00:03:55.700> get

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
over that compound bit or you know get

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.330 
over that compound bit or you know get
close<00:03:56.150> enough<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:58.159> mission

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
close enough to it so that the mission

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.899 
close enough to it so that the mission
objective<00:03:59.000> changes<00:03:59.510> because<00:04:00.729> that's<00:04:01.729> what

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
objective changes because that's what

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.159 
objective changes because that's what
should<00:04:02.090> change<00:04:02.359> today<00:04:02.540> I've<00:04:02.840> done<00:04:02.989> another

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
should change today I've done another

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.990 
should change today I've done another
cut<00:04:03.470> there<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.010> should<00:04:04.250> change<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.579> collect

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
cut there it should change to collect

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.879 
cut there it should change to collect
the<00:04:05.150> container<00:04:05.569> so<00:04:06.199> yeah<00:04:06.349> I've<00:04:06.440> got<00:04:06.590> a<00:04:06.620> bit<00:04:06.769> out

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
the container so yeah I've got a bit out

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.860 
the container so yeah I've got a bit out
went<00:04:07.699> in<00:04:08.349> there<00:04:09.349> is<00:04:09.409> a<00:04:09.440> bit<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.799> fight<00:04:10.870> with

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870
