00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
most benefit to your enemy what is the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.190 
most benefit to your enemy what is the
main<00:01:29.810> difference<00:01:30.350> between<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:31.640> 465<00:01:32.570> or<00:01:32.960> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
main difference between the 465 or the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.460 
main difference between the 465 or the
rock<00:01:33.440> well<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.760> 465<00:01:35.600> we<00:01:35.900> brought<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.320> out

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
rock well the 465 we brought it out

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.610 
rock well the 465 we brought it out
because<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:37.600> customer<00:01:38.600> demand<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.320> people

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
because of customer demand so people

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.210 
because of customer demand so people
want<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.860> know<00:01:39.950> if<00:01:40.250> we<00:01:40.460> had<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.670> ground<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
want to know if we had a ground the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.490 
want to know if we had a ground the
ground<00:01:43.490> does<00:01:43.850> not<00:01:44.060> last<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:44.720> long<00:01:44.900> as<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> rock

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
ground does not last as long as the rock

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.890 
ground does not last as long as the rock
so<00:01:45.830> we've<00:01:46.010> made<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.430> little<00:01:46.610> more

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
so we've made it a little more

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.630 
so we've made it a little more
economical<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:48.470> will<00:01:48.710> leach<00:01:48.920> into<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.310> ground

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
economical it will leach into the ground

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.969 
economical it will leach into the ground
faster<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:51.049> minerals<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:51.710> soak<00:01:51.950> into

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
faster so the minerals will soak into

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.490 
faster so the minerals will soak into
the<00:01:52.280> ground<00:01:52.340> faster<00:01:53.180> than<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.690> rock<00:01:53.900> what

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
the ground faster than the rock what

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.250 
the ground faster than the rock what
makes<00:01:54.920> trophy<00:01:55.700> rocks<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.330> much<00:01:56.540> better<00:01:56.870> than

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
makes trophy rocks so much better than

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.070 
makes trophy rocks so much better than
all<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.560> other<00:01:57.740> products<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.190> are<00:01:58.310> out<00:01:58.490> well
