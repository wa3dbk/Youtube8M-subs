simple question that I ask myself how

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.080 
simple question that I ask myself how
can<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.799> better<00:01:25.009> for<00:01:25.520> example<00:01:25.880> we<00:01:26.000> were

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
can this be better for example we were

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.899 
can this be better for example we were
redesigning<00:01:26.600> our<00:01:26.780> lipstick<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:28.759> made

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
redesigning our lipstick and it's made

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.670 
redesigning our lipstick and it's made
out<00:01:28.939> of<00:01:29.090> plastic<00:01:29.270> which<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:30.079> non-renewable

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
out of plastic which is a non-renewable

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.219 
out of plastic which is a non-renewable
resource<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:32.390> thought<00:01:32.600> how<00:01:32.780> can<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.049> be

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
resource and I thought how can this be

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.780 
resource and I thought how can this be
better<00:01:33.439> wouldn't<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:33.799> be<00:01:33.920> great<00:01:34.040> if<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.579> tube

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
better wouldn't it be great if the tube

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.030 
better wouldn't it be great if the tube
was<00:01:34.970> made<00:01:35.180> out<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.329> a<00:01:35.540> renewable<00:01:36.170> resource<00:01:36.350> and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
was made out of a renewable resource and

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.410 
was made out of a renewable resource and
wouldn't<00:01:37.220> it<00:01:37.250> be<00:01:37.340> great<00:01:37.520> if<00:01:37.610> two<00:01:37.909> dollars<00:01:38.240> from

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
wouldn't it be great if two dollars from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.270 
wouldn't it be great if two dollars from
every<00:01:38.570> product<00:01:39.049> went<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.470> benefit<00:01:39.890> children's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.179 
every product went to benefit children's
charities<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.540> simple<00:01:42.320> question<00:01:42.710> how<00:01:42.920> can

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
charities and so simple question how can

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.429 
charities and so simple question how can
this<00:01:43.310> be<00:01:43.520> better<00:01:43.790> is<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.540> challenge<00:01:45.020> that

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
this be better is the challenge that

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.260 
this be better is the challenge that
gets<00:01:45.649> put<00:01:45.829> forth<00:01:46.130> every<00:01:46.549> time<00:01:46.790> we<00:01:46.939> launch<00:01:47.060> a

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
something that was really important that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.899 
something that was really important that
I<00:01:50.930> learned<00:01:51.200> at<00:01:51.380> York<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.979> gave<00:01:52.460> me<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> lot<00:01:52.850> of

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
I learned at York it gave me a lot of

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.999 
I learned at York it gave me a lot of
the<00:01:53.060> skills<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.630> I<00:01:53.659> didn't<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.170> before<00:01:54.200> but

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
the skills that I didn't have before but

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.889 
the skills that I didn't have before but
also<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.520> confidence<00:01:55.880> because<00:01:56.299> you<00:01:56.719> know<00:01:56.840> you

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
also the confidence because you know you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.749 
also the confidence because you know you
get<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.140> sense<00:01:58.040> that<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.340> know<00:01:58.460> what<00:01:58.640> you're

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
get a sense that you know what you're

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.850 
get a sense that you know what you're
doing<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.119> little<00:01:59.270> bit<00:01:59.479> better<00:01:59.689> than<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:00.710> you

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
doing a little bit better than if you

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520 
doing a little bit better than if you
didn't<00:02:01.100> have<00:02:01.219> any<00:02:01.960> educational<00:02:02.960> background

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
didn't have any educational background

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.130 
didn't have any educational background
in<00:02:03.710> business

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
in business

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
in business
I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.830> most<00:02:04.979> important<00:02:05.490> lesson<00:02:06.120> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
I think the most important lesson I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
I think the most important lesson I
learned<00:02:06.510> was<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.800> don't<00:02:08.130> have<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
learned was you really don't have to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
learned was you really don't have to
know<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:08.880> doing<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
know what you're doing you just have to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.229 
know what you're doing you just have to
do<00:02:10.050> it
