00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hey guys its trigger here and I wanted

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey guys its trigger here and I wanted
to<00:00:03.210> talk<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.899> little<00:00:04.440> bit<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:04.859> the

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
to talk to you a little bit about the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.880 
to talk to you a little bit about the
cyclic<00:00:05.460> rate<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.819> fire<00:00:06.230> using<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.620> select

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
cyclic rate of fire using the select

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.419 
cyclic rate of fire using the select
fire<00:00:08.010> feature<00:00:08.309> on<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.790> swat-556<00:00:10.130> now<00:00:11.130> I

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
fire feature on the swat-556 now I

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.780 
fire feature on the swat-556 now I
calculated<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.360> cyclic<00:00:12.960> rpm<00:00:13.700> using<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
calculated the cyclic rpm using the

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
calculated the cyclic rpm using the
first<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> last<00:00:15.570> bullet<00:00:16.170> times<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:17.220> once

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
first and last bullet times from once

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849 
first and last bullet times from once
they<00:00:17.760> left<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> chamber<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:19.109> results<00:00:19.529> here

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
they left the chamber the results here

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.890 
they left the chamber the results here
have<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> bit<00:00:20.820> more<00:00:20.939> consistency<00:00:21.510> than<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
have a bit more consistency than the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
have a bit more consistency than the
previous<00:00:22.350> test<00:00:22.650> I'd<00:00:22.830> into<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> ChiComs<00:00:23.670> even

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
previous test I'd into the ChiComs even

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.109 
previous test I'd into the ChiComs even
be<00:00:24.330> using<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> basic<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:26.130> fire<00:00:26.490> feature<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
be using the basic first fire feature I

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.279 
be using the basic first fire feature I
was<00:00:27.599> able<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.930> create<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> steady<00:00:28.500> rpm<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.369> 450

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
was able to create a steady rpm of 450

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.650 
was able to create a steady rpm of 450
having<00:00:31.289> full<00:00:31.500> auto<00:00:31.769> set<00:00:32.219> cranked<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> RPM

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
having full auto set cranked up the RPM

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290 
having full auto set cranked up the RPM
twice<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.829> burst<00:00:35.040> fire<00:00:35.309> mode<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
twice that of the burst fire mode into a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.500 
twice that of the burst fire mode into a
nine<00:00:36.600> hundred<00:00:37.020> rpm<00:00:37.410> range<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
nine hundred rpm range so which is the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
nine hundred rpm range so which is the
best<00:00:39.780> well<00:00:40.620> you're<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> need<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> look

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
best well you're going to need to look

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.900 
best well you're going to need to look
at<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> world<00:00:41.940> spray<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> choice

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
at the world spray and make that choice

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
at the world spray and make that choice
speed<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.030> consistency<00:00:45.710> burst<00:00:46.710> fire<00:00:46.950> gives

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
speed or consistency burst fire gives

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
speed or consistency burst fire gives
you<00:00:47.399> pretty<00:00:47.879> much<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.930> bull's-eye

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you pretty much kind of a bull's-eye

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.470 
you pretty much kind of a bull's-eye
consistency<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.460> opposed<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.199> full<00:00:52.680> auto

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
consistency as opposed to the full auto

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
consistency as opposed to the full auto
basically<00:00:54.480> doubling<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.020> web<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.379> speed<00:00:55.620> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
basically doubling your web and speed so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
basically doubling your web and speed so
there's<00:00:56.579> quite<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> drastic<00:00:57.809> difference<00:00:58.260> here

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there's quite a drastic difference here

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
there's quite a drastic difference here
now<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> talk<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.149> its<00:01:00.690> bullseye

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
now when I talk about its bullseye

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
now when I talk about its bullseye
consistency<00:01:01.890> I'm<00:01:02.039> basically<00:01:02.430> talking<00:01:02.760> about

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
consistency I'm basically talking about

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.690 
consistency I'm basically talking about
ad<00:01:03.329> essing<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.470> possible<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> use<00:01:05.369> full

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ad essing is it possible to use full

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
ad essing is it possible to use full
auto<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.270> burst<00:01:06.659> fire<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> gun<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
auto and burst fire the gun for that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
auto and burst fire the gun for that
extra<00:01:07.830> bullet<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.119> more

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
extra bullet to make it them more

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.960 
extra bullet to make it them more
powerful<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.229> believe<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.250> possible<00:01:11.460> but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
powerful I believe it's possible but

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490 
powerful I believe it's possible but
you'll<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> spend<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.170> extra<00:01:13.260> time

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you'll have to spend some extra time

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
you'll have to spend some extra time
trying<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> practice<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.640> affect<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
trying to practice that affect it but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
trying to practice that affect it but
also<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.950> full<00:01:17.159> auto<00:01:17.430> feature<00:01:17.790> you're

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
also with the full auto feature you're

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.210 
also with the full auto feature you're
going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.560> less<00:01:19.740> accurate

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
going to be a little bit less accurate

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
going to be a little bit less accurate
this<00:01:20.580> gun<00:01:20.759> feels<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> type<00:01:21.720> 95<00:01:22.130> from

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this gun feels like the type 95 from

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.469 
this gun feels like the type 95 from
long<00:01:23.430> range<00:01:23.810> yet<00:01:25.130> less<00:01:26.130> accurate<00:01:26.700> close<00:01:27.090> range

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
long range yet less accurate close range

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
long range yet less accurate close range
will<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.409> make<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> long<00:01:28.770> story<00:01:28.829> short<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
will to make a long story short if you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.999 
will to make a long story short if you
like<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> 80s<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.829> basically

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like to 80s like I do you can basically

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
like to 80s like I do you can basically
bump<00:01:32.520> fire<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.970> gun<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> full<00:01:33.450> auto<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
bump fire the gun in full auto and it

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
bump fire the gun in full auto and it
should<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.740> relatively<00:01:35.220> well<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.759> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
should do relatively well for you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
should do relatively well for you
especially<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:36.990> ad<00:01:37.170> essing<00:01:37.560> non<00:01:38.310> 80s<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
especially if your ad essing non 80s I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
especially if your ad essing non 80s I
think<00:01:39.329> it'd<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:40.049> too<00:01:40.110> inaccurate<00:01:40.790> only<00:01:41.790> if

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
think it'd be way too inaccurate only if

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
think it'd be way too inaccurate only if
you're<00:01:42.000> very<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.390> close<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> enemy<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you're very very close to the enemy and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're very very close to the enemy and
then<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:44.939> work<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.390> um<00:01:45.689> yeah

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
then it would probably work but um yeah

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.340 
then it would probably work but um yeah
so<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.790> pretty<00:01:47.939> much<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.540> hope<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> guys

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
so that's pretty much it I hope you guys

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.069 
so that's pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoyed<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.950> test<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> did<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
enjoyed this test that I did and if so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.960 
enjoyed this test that I did and if so
