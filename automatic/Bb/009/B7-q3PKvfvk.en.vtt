00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
it takes it to unlock

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.770 
it takes it to unlock
so<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.370> race<00:03:23.640> day<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.570> bit

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
so on race day it's a little bit

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.270 
so on race day it's a little bit
different<00:03:24.990> than<00:03:25.320> when<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:25.890> pre<00:03:26.100> run

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
different than when you get to pre run

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
different than when you get to pre run
the<00:03:26.370> course<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> combine<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.200> with

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the course so now you combine that with

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.890 
the course so now you combine that with
being<00:03:28.890> in<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.130> dust<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.910> you're<00:03:30.390> dodging
