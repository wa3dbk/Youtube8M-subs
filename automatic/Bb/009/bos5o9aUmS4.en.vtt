 next to her is Philipp Fock and Diamonds here after the tournament now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.109
 hit the third part of the video diary Zan ultimately the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.449
 international versatility of their village cell 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.989
 to record March in the art you have become second 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:24.539
 getting started as a leader was not always easy or 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.699
 Yes thank you 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.179
 So it was really tight Judge Dr "Zero Comma something just ahead 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.789
 and therefore I was not even allowed time for expired 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.960
 and the horse can go to normal zero but Jak 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.100
 I have all the time 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.590
 I did not want too much and then I wanted to go with Werder 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.620
 the course but also very demanding and also around and from the time that he 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.040
 very tight 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.880
 I start now normal so normal two stars but to the abduction 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.960
 is she at those 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.160
 I believe someone's victory more difficult 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.100
 even if he does not allow Unia from both courses on the individual 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.190
 was very tight 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.690
 which is not so bad 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.480
 It remains to be seen now if everything loves the meeting I just remember 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.970
 two star flight and also placed in other browsers on correctly yes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.980
 Percent is also 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.220
 Been seventh in the championship Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg championship 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.750
 I started what you want 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.050
 and he has one 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.250
 Forward on 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 yes I am now but not before but Stephan Walter 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.300
 so it Ankara from Bottrop liberation celebrated 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.210
 seriously consider that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.520
 how are these and other details 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.490
 yes, I assume that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.000
 the two now where I have suffered here is always the goal here 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.690
 1 2 beautiful Kuwait will 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 and then to circle around for easy pagans 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.060
