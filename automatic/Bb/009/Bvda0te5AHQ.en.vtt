00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
mean that the fire sorcery was just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
mean that the fire sorcery was just
rediscovered<00:01:57.360> somehow<00:01:57.659> impaired<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.590> mind

about so I'm pretty sure they'll have an

thing I can think of to talk over during

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.220 
thing I can think of to talk over during
his<00:03:04.250> footage<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:05.900> now<00:03:06.019> hold

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
his footage is that you can now hold

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.960 
his footage is that you can now hold
three<00:03:06.530> things<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.950> each<00:03:07.040> hand<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.579> weapons

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
three things in each hand so weapons

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.599 
three things in each hand so weapons
shields<00:03:08.299> talismans<00:03:09.260> sorcery<00:03:09.739> catalysts<00:03:10.400> all

that<00:03:10.909> stuff<00:03:11.150> three<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:11.989> each<00:03:12.049> hand<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:12.889> this

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
that stuff three in each hand so this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.190 
that stuff three in each hand so this
offers<00:03:13.370> more<00:03:13.639> variety<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.359> remember<00:03:15.079> that

equipment<00:03:16.879> load<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.269> mind<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:17.720> you're<00:03:17.870> not

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
equipment load in mind so you're not

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.289 
equipment load in mind so you're not
going<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.139> overburden<00:03:18.590> yourself<00:03:19.180> now<00:03:20.180> if

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
going to overburden yourself now if

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.670 
going to overburden yourself now if
you're<00:03:20.419> super<00:03:20.599> observant<00:03:21.199> you<00:03:21.410> might<00:03:21.560> have

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
you're super observant you might have

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.170 
you're super observant you might have
noticed<00:03:21.949> a<00:03:22.040> few<00:03:22.069> more<00:03:22.340> changes<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:22.940> core

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
noticed a few more changes to the core

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
noticed a few more changes to the core
gameplay<00:03:23.419> mechanics<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:24.949> terms<00:03:25.129> of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
gameplay mechanics so in terms of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.250 
gameplay mechanics so in terms of
movement<00:03:25.579> rolling<00:03:26.299> seems<00:03:26.569> to<00:03:26.750> have<00:03:26.840> changed

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
movement rolling seems to have changed

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.439 
movement rolling seems to have changed
in<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.489> have<00:03:28.639> a<00:03:28.669> lighter<00:03:28.940> character

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
in that if you have a lighter character

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.000 
in that if you have a lighter character
you<00:03:29.690> actually<00:03:30.049> roll<00:03:30.230> faster<00:03:30.650> which<00:03:30.889> is

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
you actually roll faster which is

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.939 
you actually roll faster which is
nothing<00:03:31.160> new<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.609> further<00:03:32.359> as<00:03:32.660> well<00:03:32.870> as<00:03:33.109> well

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
nothing new and further as well as well

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.589 
nothing new and further as well as well
as<00:03:34.069> acquiring<00:03:34.549> more<00:03:34.730> invincibility<00:03:35.389> frames

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
as acquiring more invincibility frames

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.229 
as acquiring more invincibility frames
than<00:03:36.139> a<00:03:36.199> heavier<00:03:36.470> character<00:03:36.949> so<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.940> extra

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
than a heavier character so the extra

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.909 
than a heavier character so the extra
invincibility<00:03:38.780> frames<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.379> a<00:03:39.410> cool<00:03:39.620> change

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
invincibility frames is a cool change

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.920 
invincibility frames is a cool change
although<00:03:40.359> playtesters<00:03:41.359> noticed<00:03:41.720> that

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
although playtesters noticed that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.689 
although playtesters noticed that
invincibility<00:03:42.769> frames<00:03:42.980> were<00:03:43.370> really

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
invincibility frames were really

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.000 
invincibility frames were really
difficult<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.209> exploit<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.750> demo<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.290> also

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
difficult to exploit in the demo I also

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.439 
difficult to exploit in the demo I also
have<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.340> feeling<00:03:46.579> from<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.000> gameplay<00:03:47.180> that

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
have a feeling from the gameplay that

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.659 
have a feeling from the gameplay that
there<00:03:47.870> won't<00:03:47.989> be<00:03:48.109> categories<00:03:48.799> like<00:03:49.010> fast<00:03:49.400> or

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
there won't be categories like fast or

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.640 
there won't be categories like fast or
old<00:03:49.760> medium<00:03:50.209> roll<00:03:50.419> and<00:03:50.629> heavy<00:03:50.959> roll<00:03:51.139> anymore

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
old medium roll and heavy roll anymore

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.680 
old medium roll and heavy roll anymore
from<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.489> gameplay<00:03:52.669> it<00:03:52.940> seems<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.510> roll

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
from the gameplay it seems like the roll

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.809 
from the gameplay it seems like the roll
speed<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.319> distance<00:03:54.560> scales<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:55.730> the

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
speed and distance scales with the

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.319 
speed and distance scales with the
character<00:03:56.239> weight<00:03:56.419> I<00:03:56.690> could<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.409> wrong<00:03:57.560> though

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
character weight I could be wrong though

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.909 
character weight I could be wrong though
parrying<00:03:59.329> is<00:03:59.569> reportedly<00:04:00.109> much<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.590> same<00:04:00.739> at

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
parrying is reportedly much the same at

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.289 
parrying is reportedly much the same at
this<00:04:01.040> stage<00:04:01.250> although<00:04:01.549> one<00:04:01.849> journalist

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
this stage although one journalist

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.909 
this stage although one journalist
mentioned<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.840> he<00:04:02.989> could<00:04:03.139> knock<00:04:03.379> enemies<00:04:03.620> to

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
mentioned that he could knock enemies to

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.979 
mentioned that he could knock enemies to
the<00:04:04.010> ground<00:04:04.250> with<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.609> perhaps<00:04:05.449> that's<00:04:05.690> also<00:04:05.959> a

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
the ground with it perhaps that's also a

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.170 
the ground with it perhaps that's also a
method<00:04:06.349> of<00:04:06.440> crowd<00:04:06.739> control<00:04:07.180> playtesters

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
method of crowd control playtesters

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.729 
method of crowd control playtesters
mentioned<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:08.870> they<00:04:09.019> had<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> really<00:04:09.500> hard

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
mentioned that they had a really hard

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.530 
mentioned that they had a really hard
time<00:04:09.859> parrying<00:04:10.489> which<00:04:10.669> is<00:04:11.030> interesting

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
time parrying which is interesting

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.819 
time parrying which is interesting
because<00:04:11.900> it's<00:04:12.139> already<00:04:12.260> fairly<00:04:12.650> challenging

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
because it's already fairly challenging

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.569 
because it's already fairly challenging
as<00:04:13.190> well<00:04:14.169> back<00:04:15.169> stabs<00:04:15.530> are<00:04:15.799> where<00:04:16.010> most<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.459> the

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
as well back stabs are where most of the

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.009 
as well back stabs are where most of the
changes<00:04:16.970> appear<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.479> that's<00:04:17.750> good

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
changes appear and that's good

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.719 
changes appear and that's good
considering<00:04:18.500> back<00:04:18.799> steps<00:04:19.070> need<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.280> nerf<00:04:19.519> in

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
considering back steps need a nerf in

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.750 
considering back steps need a nerf in
both<00:04:19.880> PvE<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.510> PvP<00:04:21.099> firstly<00:04:22.099> they're<00:04:22.400> harder

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
both PvE and PvP firstly they're harder

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.520 
both PvE and PvP firstly they're harder
to<00:04:22.880> perform<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.479> mentioned<00:04:24.169> earlier<00:04:24.500> that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
to perform I mentioned earlier that

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.020 
to perform I mentioned earlier that
enemies<00:04:25.310> pivot<00:04:25.700> much<00:04:25.880> faster<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.510> track<00:04:26.750> your

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
enemies pivot much faster and track your

enemies pivot much faster and track your
much<00:04:27.450> better<00:04:27.830> secondly<00:04:28.830> they're<00:04:29.190> really

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
much better secondly they're really

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.030 
much better secondly they're really
really<00:04:29.910> dynamic<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.660> time<00:04:30.870> around<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.350> series

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
really dynamic this time around a series

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.160

swords and some testers mentioned that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.730 
swords and some testers mentioned that
they<00:04:36.390> picked<00:04:36.660> up<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> enemy<00:04:37.200> with<00:04:37.350> their<00:04:37.470> stab

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
they picked up the enemy with their stab

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.170 
they picked up the enemy with their stab
and<00:04:37.950> slammed<00:04:38.220> him<00:04:38.370> onto<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.730> ground

and slammed him onto the ground
but<00:04:39.810> now<00:04:40.020> these<00:04:40.320> different<00:04:40.770> animations

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
but now these different animations

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.070

actually<00:04:41.640> matter<00:04:41.850> because<00:04:42.270> many<00:04:42.840> play

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
actually matter because many play

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
testers were shocked to discover that

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.830 
testers were shocked to discover that
they<00:04:44.640> could<00:04:44.820> actually<00:04:44.970> take<00:04:45.120> damage<00:04:45.510> while

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
they could actually take damage while

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
performing the animation this is a big

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.090 
performing the animation this is a big
change<00:04:48.240> imagine<00:04:48.870> what<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.500> will<00:04:49.590> be<00:04:49.710> like<00:04:49.920> to

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
change imagine what it will be like to

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.010 
change imagine what it will be like to
be<00:04:50.190> broken<00:04:50.610> out<00:04:50.730> of<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.030> backstab<00:04:51.540> animation

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
be broken out of that backstab animation

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.260 
be broken out of that backstab animation
or<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.230> take<00:04:52.410> damage<00:04:52.770> during<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.970> makes<00:04:54.150> me

or to take damage during it it makes me

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.730
