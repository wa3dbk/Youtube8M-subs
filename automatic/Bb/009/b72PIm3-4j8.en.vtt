we<00:00:18.350> really<00:00:18.620> want<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:18.890> make<00:00:18.950> sure<00:00:19.040> that<00:00:19.400> there's

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.580 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:19.700> contrast<00:00:20.240> between<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.990> negative<00:00:21.440> space

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.570 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:22.570> then<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.840> high-tension<00:00:24.350> Speights<00:00:24.830> you

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.519 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.150> exploration<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.110> need<00:00:27.320> the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.220 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:28.310> need<00:00:28.550> something<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.330> to<00:00:30.020> say

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.710 
scavenging you need something to to say
like<00:00:30.440> okay<00:00:30.740> I'm<00:00:31.279> setting<00:00:31.700> a<00:00:31.759> certain<00:00:32.029> tone<00:00:32.240> and

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.170 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:33.140> patina<00:00:33.470> here<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.790> then<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.150> can

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.240 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:36.110> some<00:00:36.380> stark<00:00:36.710> like

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
contrast that with some stark like
