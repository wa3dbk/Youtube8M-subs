00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.840 

still<00:03:52.750> trying<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.200> get<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.530> under<00:03:53.860> control<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
still trying to get it under control and

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.720 
still trying to get it under control and
and<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.810> know<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.960> would<00:03:56.620> say<00:03:56.650> maybe<00:03:57.490> they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
and you know I would say maybe they

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.400 
and you know I would say maybe they
could<00:03:57.910> drive<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.300> down<00:03:58.420> off<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.720> track<00:03:58.990> but<00:03:59.260> if

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
could drive it down off the track but if

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.380 
could drive it down off the track but if
you<00:03:59.530> look<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.800> pass<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.550> driver's<00:04:00.820> door<00:04:01.000> is

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
you look to pass the driver's door is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.610 
you look to pass the driver's door is
caved<00:04:01.720> in

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620
