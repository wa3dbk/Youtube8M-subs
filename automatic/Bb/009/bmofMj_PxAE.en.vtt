00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.910
 good as sound sonic good 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.709
 Last Friday I was playing a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.110
 improvisation about a song 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.370
 kind of pop ballad 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.050
 everything use several little things let's say that 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.320
 melodic elements that are used to 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.680
 play music on any instrument 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.680
 would like 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.350
 to win in detail each event 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.420
 develop the mint the works these are 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.970
 things so the first thing we're going to 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.769
 to do is see the scales a little bit 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.680
 older in this case the issue was in 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.050
 the sun greater and good the greater sun 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.670
 some positions on the guitar that 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.610
 they are well known 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.290
 let's show a little those 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.650
 positions 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.650
 for one of the things that you use about this 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.930
 song is the biggest sun scale 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.580
 just because the ballad is in sun 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.430
 and the scales on the guitar are usually 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.800
 learn the sun are five drawings this 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.160
 is the first number one 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.610
 start with your two finger in the sixth 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.530
 fret rope 3 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.890
 we go through the sun scale of 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:28.360
 this way 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:30.010
 sun the if all re my f sharp sun or 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.430
 let's make a scale an octave 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.430
 entire 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.000
 and now a little more sun 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.470
 if you 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.480
 has sustained me are only two octaves that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.480
 the same thing is repeated but it is more acute 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.700
 it is advisable to practice these 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 scales with or alternate at hand 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.870
 right all the time down or up 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:13.940
 down up or down up and so on and 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.700
 you can with a metronome more or less in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.250
 an 80 well one hand well orders 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 always the positions by the hand well 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.260
 on the guitar a finger of each fret 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.659
 do not go looking 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.459
 do not do this but touch and touch and 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.209
 taking but always the hand and the finger 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.209
 only low 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 it is the face of greater sun the drawing number 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.690
 one 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.900
 well now let's see how is the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.000
 result of this scale on this 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.000
 song that we have to play 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.110
 Y 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.110
 and 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.850
 do not 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.420
 once 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.420
 I like it 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.709
 Hello
