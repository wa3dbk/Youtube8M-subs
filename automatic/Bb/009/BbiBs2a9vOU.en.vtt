00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 and people is that shrimp app 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.240
 today we find ourselves still a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 times take rather how to download 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 free 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 minecraft the very latest 1.7.2 because 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.840
 than on my previous video commented 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 exchanged michael for free a point 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.810
 6.46 I remember well 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.429
 well there were a lot of problems 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.740
 for some people 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.380
 so I will try again to do a course 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 a tutorial to see if this one this time 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.760
 it can oppose 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.010
 so you will go to this site I 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 will give you the address in the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 description do not worry we get 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 gives 90 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 then you just click here 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:59.690
 will download a file in the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:03.329
 folder and you install it yes 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.450
 so iron installs then then you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.720
 uncheck that and that I advise you 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 because these two things there these are 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.479
 how to say it's basically the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.250
 when you open google you will 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.549
 a little bar the whole bar 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.390
 babylone thing and all that and you have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 not at all want to have that I will do I 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.060
 you advise if we will have life 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.049
 it's not my problem 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.950
 if you do next then I accept there 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.220
 you do 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 because see there is iec td he so 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.530
 you make declines because that you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.729
 to install anything if you have 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.200
 do you want to read the license agreement 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.990
 and you want it to be installed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.409
 I do not know how slow your pc is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 so there he will propose to install 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.240
 something for another software 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.649
 that you do not want but who will 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 settle down if you do next you 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.369
 always decline the beeb hold up 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.890
 it's a trick there for it's basically all 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.390
 that's a bit of pubs that without internship 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.069
 without really asking you it's written 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.149
 as small as it will settle all 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.160
 right away but you always do 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.370
 declined 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.490
 so I'm always going to say declines 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.570
 declines declines and so that's you 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:26.450
 unfold everything unless you want 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:30.770
 where are you going? 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 it's good it finished installing and that's it 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:38.770
 so it's going you okay you re 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:49.220
 put back on the site up disengages or the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:51.950
 then we remove the ad have 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.110
 then safari ni bate so I had 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.110
 sedges already downloaded a crack 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.300
 you see huh it's a nickname of 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.700
 mount chaqra that I will use to 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.500
 do anything we join to 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.570
 right away when the finished strait has 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.460
 right now 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.800
 re legend so here it is soon over 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.720
 also I forgot to tell you this is 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.520
 very important you have to install java 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.760
 so I advise you to download it 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.709
 on oracle to type us on google 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.900
 I swallow of onal java so if you have a 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.350
 32-bit computer can download java 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.140
 30.2 on 64 bits or downloaded at 64 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.780
 I do not know anything about it 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.550
 look on google you will find 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.410
 so here is the download soon 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.230
 finished present to install everything java 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.540
 it's obligatory if you do not have java 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.989
 almost sure you will not succeed 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.330
 no play at minecraft 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.700
 in any case that's what I know 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.730
 also to the passage happy holidays of end 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.900
 of year finally joyous new year and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.110
 I hope you will have a hiccup 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.790
 new year I did not do a lot of 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.820
 video do we know if that's because it's 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.250
 the Christmas dress up effect the new year and 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.770
 especially are three tons of fingers and yes 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.450
 but I see what it's like 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.230
 holidays I think you too are you 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.400
 a little busy with your buttocks it takes 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.400
 from the time when there 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.590
 it takes time to listen we are going to 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.960
 find immediately after a relay 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.240
 paged jeans not even expected not even 5 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.560
 seconds and then that's so what when 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.030
 happened to you can choose your 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.720
 version so whenever they 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.500
 would have a new version 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.690
 it will be put therefore 1.7 1.6 so also 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.720
 if you want to install forge and well 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:49.930
 you go in or on windows 8 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:53.050
 you go in searched percent of 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.550
 abdat 1% 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.800
 enter you go minecraft job 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.539
 then you go in version is 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.240
 after all the versions you 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.370
 do not be ashamed if you want to do so 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.910
 you want a style a mode not in 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.010
 strength 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.810
 you take the version you want 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.870
 it's important take for example you 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.389
 copied then makes you paste and 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.669
 it opens chrtr 1.5.2 copy you open it 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.190
 then you will have a file that 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.010
 is called 1.5.2 stitch 1.5.2 j 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.090
 so that's why you rename them 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.820
 every two years takes 5 points 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.530
 copies like the name of the folder and then 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.479
 in the gissen file you have to 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.389
 open it with the notepad is in 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.340
 you have to rename here it will be written 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.380
 just 1.5.2 but you will have to rename it 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.580
 take five points two copies here 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.560
 that's how you will install 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.940
 forge then in the versions you 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.289
 will have thinking for two copies 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.849
 were here after you have this strong 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.889
 that you want your day you 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.330
 take what you want and then where 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.419
 you choose your version for me I 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.160
 the impression of wounds and that's it 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.639
 good you have your minecraft that's 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.220
 magnificent 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.849
 you multiplayer or solo like 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.229
 so you want to see I had you 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.370
 still still the same maps arc the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.990
 same point as if you have multiple 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.539
 minecraft it does not matter you have 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.620
 always the same I hope to 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.479
 to bring together the videos do not hesitate to 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.639
 let go a green thumb that will be fun 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.260
 if you still have the same problem 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.820
 say it in the comments because 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.130

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.729
 my old tutor so we'll see each other again 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.729
 surely for next time jo
