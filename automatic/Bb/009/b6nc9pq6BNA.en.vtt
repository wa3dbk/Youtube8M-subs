00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.050 
obviously find the area where you want
to<00:01:27.410> build<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:27.740> base<00:01:27.890> now<00:01:28.490> I'm<00:01:28.700> going<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.000> be

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
to build your base now I'm going to be

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.220 
to build your base now I'm going to be
building<00:01:29.240> mine<00:01:29.480> here<00:01:29.690> right<00:01:29.900> out<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.170> open

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
building mine here right out in the open

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.690 
building mine here right out in the open
but<00:01:30.620> if<00:01:30.770> you<00:01:30.860> actually<00:01:31.070> wanted<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.670> a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
but if you actually wanted to have a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.700 
but if you actually wanted to have a
hidden<00:01:31.940> location<00:01:32.060> like<00:01:32.690> I<00:01:32.870> said<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.470> probably

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
hidden location like I said you probably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.230 
hidden location like I said you probably
want<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:33.920> do<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:34.130> over<00:01:34.340> there<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:34.760> the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
want to do it over there and like the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.270 
want to do it over there and like the
side<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.810> hillside<00:01:36.020> or<00:01:36.410> something<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.130> it

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
side of a hillside or something so it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.680 
side of a hillside or something so it
just<00:01:37.550> would<00:01:37.700> blend<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.120> little<00:01:38.360> bit<00:01:38.480> more

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
just would blend in a little bit more

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.120 
just would blend in a little bit more
but<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> start<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.740> you're<00:01:39.830> going<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.010> want

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
but to start what you're going to want

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.410 
but to start what you're going to want
to<00:01:40.160> go<00:01:40.250> ahead<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.430> do<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.790> start<00:01:41.090> by<00:01:41.120> placing

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
to go ahead and do is start by placing

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.470 
to go ahead and do is start by placing
down<00:01:41.660> three<00:01:42.140> pieces<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.680> snow<00:01:42.980> so<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:44.000> two

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
down three pieces of snow so one two

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.940 
down three pieces of snow so one two
three<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.680> there<00:01:45.830> we<00:01:45.920> have

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
three and you can see there we have

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.890 
three and you can see there we have
three<00:01:46.220> pieces<00:01:46.400> of<00:01:46.580> snow<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.030> then<00:01:47.480> on<00:01:47.600> top<00:01:47.840> of

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
three pieces of snow and then on top of

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.480 
three pieces of snow and then on top of
that<00:01:48.050> we<00:01:48.260> need<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.530> put<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.800> minecart

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
that we need to put a minecart

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.490 
that we need to put a minecart
so<00:01:49.910> if<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.030> go<00:01:50.210> ahead<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.480> I<00:01:50.600> go<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:50.900> this<00:01:50.960> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
so if I go ahead and I go like this and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.820 
so if I go ahead and I go like this and
I<00:01:52.340> place<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.790> minecart<00:01:53.360> rail<00:01:53.750> as<00:01:54.050> well<00:01:54.290> as<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
I place a minecart rail as well as the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.230 
I place a minecart rail as well as the
minecart<00:01:55.280> itself<00:01:55.610> right<00:01:55.760> there<00:01:55.820> on<00:01:56.060> top

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
minecart itself right there on top

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.750 
minecart itself right there on top
whatnot<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.110> like<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.580> then<00:01:58.730> I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
whatnot like that like so and then I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.400 
whatnot like that like so and then I
break<00:01:59.030> out<00:01:59.150> this<00:01:59.300> block<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.840> see<00:02:00.020> whammo

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
break out this block you can see whammo

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.770 
break out this block you can see whammo
now<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:00.950> have<00:02:01.280> ourselves<00:02:01.430> a<00:02:01.910> minecart<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.570> top

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
now we have ourselves a minecart on top

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.340 
now we have ourselves a minecart on top
of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.020> snow

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
of the snow

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380 
of the snow
now<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.070> thing<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:04.880> makes<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.150> glitch

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
now the thing that makes this glitch

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.820 
now the thing that makes this glitch
work<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.750> actually<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.230> fact<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.650> because

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
work is actually the fact that because

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.759 
work is actually the fact that because
of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.520> how<00:02:07.730> high<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.569> cart<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.440> snow

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
of the how high the cart is in the snow

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.009 
of the how high the cart is in the snow
you<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.519> actually<00:02:10.759> access<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.450> through<00:02:11.900> the

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
you can actually access it through the

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.270 
you can actually access it through the
block<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.739> here<00:02:12.950> I'm<00:02:13.040> still

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
block so you can see here I'm still

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.979 
block so you can see here I'm still
actually<00:02:13.459> looking<00:02:13.819> at<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> block<00:02:14.269> but<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:14.900> you

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
actually looking at the block but if you

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.180 
actually looking at the block but if you
look<00:02:15.140> down<00:02:15.230> in<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.440> bottom<00:02:15.739> left<00:02:15.920> hand<00:02:16.040> corner

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
look down in the bottom left hand corner

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.920 
look down in the bottom left hand corner
I<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.550> still<00:02:16.940> access<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.330> micro<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.719> can<00:02:17.840> see

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
I can still access the micro you can see

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.119 
I can still access the micro you can see
there<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:18.140> says<00:02:18.290> push<00:02:18.530> down<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.829> left<00:02:19.010> trigger

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
there it says push down the left trigger

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.399 
there it says push down the left trigger
to<00:02:19.700> ride<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.599> do<00:02:20.659> that<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.049> can<00:02:21.200> see

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
to ride and so if I do that you can see

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.820 
to ride and so if I do that you can see
I<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.859> into<00:02:22.249> the<00:02:22.340> minecart

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I get into the minecart

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
I get into the minecart
and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.460> out<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:23.940> all<00:02:24.120> we

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and then I can get out so now all we

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.510 
and then I can get out so now all we
need<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> block<00:02:25.740> on<00:02:25.950> top<00:02:26.250> however

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
need to do is get a block on top however

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.430 
need to do is get a block on top however
you're<00:02:27.360> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> notice<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.990> if<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> try<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
you're going to notice that if I try and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.990 
you're going to notice that if I try and
place<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> block<00:02:28.860> directly<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.520> top<00:02:29.760> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
place a block directly on top it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
place a block directly on top it's
actually<00:02:30.270> not<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.810> work<00:02:30.960> for<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.470> so

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
actually not going to work for me and so

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.890 
actually not going to work for me and so
what<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.190> need<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.880> take<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.270> piston<00:02:33.750> like

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
what I need to do is take a piston like

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110 
what I need to do is take a piston like
so<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.400> ahead<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.700> activate<00:02:35.940> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so and then go ahead and activate it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.370 
so and then go ahead and activate it
just<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> push<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> block<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.080> top<00:02:37.350> you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
just to push the block right on top you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.990 
just to push the block right on top you
can<00:02:37.680> see<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.920> glitches<00:02:38.280> there<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
can see it glitches there for just a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.700 
can see it glitches there for just a
second<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.810> then<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.080> will<00:02:40.170> actually<00:02:40.320> come

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
second but then it will actually come

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.140 
second but then it will actually come
back<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.950> then<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> break

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
back and then all you got to do is break

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.800 
back and then all you got to do is break
this<00:02:42.330> out<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.980> now<00:02:43.980> you've<00:02:44.190> gone<00:02:44.340> ahead<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
this out and now you've gone ahead and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.630 
this out and now you've gone ahead and
effectively<00:02:45.810> created<00:02:46.320> your<00:02:46.500> entrance<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.430> now

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
effectively created your entrance so now

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.090 
effectively created your entrance so now
all<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.060> need<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.360> do<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.720> create<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.290> area

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
all you need to do is create a area

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.800 
all you need to do is create a area
around<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.820> looks<00:02:51.030> realistic<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
around this that looks realistic to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.050 
around this that looks realistic to
whatever<00:02:52.020> area<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.770> built<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.100> basin<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:54.000> if

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
whatever area you built your basin so if

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.280 
whatever area you built your basin so if
I<00:02:54.150> was<00:02:54.270> trying<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.510> build<00:02:54.690> my<00:02:54.810> base<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.170> this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
I was trying to build my base in this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.630 
I was trying to build my base in this
area<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.830> pretend<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> there<00:02:56.370> was<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.610> a

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
area here pretend that there was like a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.690 
area here pretend that there was like a
false<00:02:57.030> wall<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:57.830> where<00:02:58.830> say<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.340> was<00:02:59.460> kind<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
false wall here where say it was kind of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.750 
false wall here where say it was kind of
like<00:02:59.820> this<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.890> built<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.700> up<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.330> tad

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
like this and I built this up just a tad

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
like this and I built this up just a tad
you<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.970> see<00:03:06.240> obviously<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.959> spent<00:03:07.230> some

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
you can see obviously if I spent some

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
you can see obviously if I spent some
more<00:03:07.470> time<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:07.950> how<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:09.000> exactly<00:03:09.570> this

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
more time on it how just exactly this

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.300 
more time on it how just exactly this
said<00:03:10.020> this<00:03:10.200> base<00:03:10.410> entrance<00:03:10.830> would<00:03:10.980> come<00:03:11.190> to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
said this base entrance would come to

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.040 
said this base entrance would come to
form<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.760> then<00:03:12.270> all<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
form and then all I have to do to

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.540 
form and then all I have to do to
actually<00:03:13.410> go<00:03:13.530> ahead<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.860> use<00:03:14.010> my<00:03:14.040> secret<00:03:14.459> base

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually go ahead and use my secret base

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.040 
actually go ahead and use my secret base
entrance<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.300> go<00:03:15.390> ahead<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.720> walk<00:03:15.840> up

here I just go ahead and I left trigger

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.070 
here I just go ahead and I left trigger
right<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> crack<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.900> see

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
right on the crack and you can see

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.620 
right on the crack and you can see
whammo<00:03:19.530> now<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> am<00:03:20.550> effectively<00:03:21.240> on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.480> other

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
whammo now I am effectively on the other

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.860 
whammo now I am effectively on the other
side<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.110> my<00:03:22.260> wall<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.890> my<00:03:23.070> secret<00:03:23.490> base

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
side of my wall and in my secret base

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.570 
side of my wall and in my secret base
now<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.050> are<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> couple<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.740> things<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.430> keep

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
now there are a couple of things to keep

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.220 
now there are a couple of things to keep
in<00:03:26.760> mind<00:03:26.790> when<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.330> are<00:03:27.360> hiding<00:03:27.840> your<00:03:27.959> base

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
in mind when you are hiding your base

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.110 
in mind when you are hiding your base
first<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.160> foremost<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.640> need<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.850> remember

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
first and foremost you need to remember

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.880 
first and foremost you need to remember
that<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.570> can't<00:03:31.019> be<00:03:31.200> blocking<00:03:31.470> off<00:03:31.709> these

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
that you can't be blocking off these

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.949 
that you can't be blocking off these
blocks<00:03:32.190> right<00:03:32.370> here<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:33.180> block<00:03:33.450> these<00:03:33.720> off

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
blocks right here if you block these off

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.180 
blocks right here if you block these off
it's<00:03:34.200> actually<00:03:34.470> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.650> stop<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.160> from

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
it's actually going to stop you from

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400 
it's actually going to stop you from
actually<00:03:35.730> coming<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.269> back<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:37.380> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
actually coming to the back of the the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.350 
actually coming to the back of the the
minecart<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:38.519> instead<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.030> getting<00:03:39.239> out

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
minecart because instead of getting out

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.120 
minecart because instead of getting out
of<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.600> minecart<00:03:40.019> on<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.170> back<00:03:40.350> side<00:03:40.590> you're

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
of the minecart on the back side you're

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.710 
of the minecart on the back side you're
going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> get<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:41.700> up<00:03:41.880> here<00:03:42.120> again<00:03:42.450> because

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
going to get out up here again because

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.960 
going to get out up here again because
you're<00:03:43.019> actually<00:03:43.440> blocking<00:03:43.739> where<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.610> exit

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you're actually blocking where you exit

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.699 
you're actually blocking where you exit
the<00:03:45.060> minecart<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:45.750> side<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.440> need<00:03:46.620> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the minecart on this side so you need to

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.320 
the minecart on this side so you need to
keep<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.190> these<00:03:47.340> blocks<00:03:47.580> free<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.090> both

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
keep all of these blocks free on both

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.240 
keep all of these blocks free on both
sides<00:03:48.660> of<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> minecart<00:03:49.380> because<00:03:49.950> depending

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
sides of the minecart because depending

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.250 
sides of the minecart because depending
on<00:03:50.580> where<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:51.000> have<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.510> may<00:03:51.690> spawn<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.140> on

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
on where you have it it may spawn you on

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.810 
on where you have it it may spawn you on
the<00:03:52.380> left<00:03:52.560> side<00:03:52.739> or<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> left<00:03:53.580> side

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the left side or the right the left side

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.910 
the left side or the right the left side
over<00:03:54.060> here<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.930> right<00:03:55.140> side<00:03:55.410> over<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:55.709> so

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
over here or the right side over here so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.380 
over here or the right side over here so
just<00:03:55.950> keep<00:03:56.220> all<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.580> these<00:03:56.700> blocks<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.180> either

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
just keep all of these blocks on either

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.270 
just keep all of these blocks on either
side<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> minecart<00:03:58.260> empty<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.769> you

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
side of the minecart empty and you

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.370 
side of the minecart empty and you
should<00:03:59.489> be<00:03:59.640> good<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.940> go<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.360> second<00:04:01.140> thing<00:04:01.290> to

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
should be good to go a second thing to

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.630 
should be good to go a second thing to
note<00:04:01.560> is<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:01.739> when<00:04:01.980> you're<00:04:02.130> actually<00:04:02.310> doing

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
note is that when you're actually doing

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.240 
note is that when you're actually doing
this<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.900> only<00:04:04.170> works<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.830> certain<00:04:05.160> directions

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
this it only works in certain directions

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.370 
this it only works in certain directions
so<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> actually<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> little<00:04:06.900> demo<00:04:07.200> over

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
so I actually have a little demo over

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.140 
so I actually have a little demo over
here<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.769> I've<00:04:07.860> built<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.580> can<00:04:08.700> see<00:04:08.910> here<00:04:09.120> I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
here that I've built you can see here I

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.699 
here that I've built you can see here I
have<00:04:09.450> all<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> four<00:04:10.080> different<00:04:10.230> cardinal

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
have all of the four different cardinal

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.560 
have all of the four different cardinal
directions<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.280> see<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.459> have<00:04:11.640> north<00:04:11.940> east

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
directions you can see I have north east

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.280 
directions you can see I have north east
south<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.860> west<00:04:13.950> on<00:04:14.730> my<00:04:14.910> map<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:16.109> will

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
south and west on my map and this will

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.960 
south and west on my map and this will
only<00:04:16.470> work<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:17.040> certain<00:04:17.340> directions<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.910> you

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
only work in certain directions so you

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.460 
only work in certain directions so you
can<00:04:18.180> see<00:04:18.330> here<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:18.660> if<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.810> come<00:04:18.989> over<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.200> to

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
can see here that if I come over here to

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.740 
can see here that if I come over here to
the<00:04:19.590> south-facing<00:04:19.830> one<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:21.030> go<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.690> I

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the south-facing one and I go in and I

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.659 
the south-facing one and I go in and I
come<00:04:21.959> out<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.350> will<00:04:22.380> actually<00:04:23.010> put<00:04:23.190> me<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.460> this

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
come out it will actually put me on this

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.790 
come out it will actually put me on this
side<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> minecart<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.590> glitch

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
side of the minecart and so this glitch

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.530 
side of the minecart and so this glitch
will<00:04:26.040> work<00:04:26.250> when<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.490> are<00:04:26.520> facing<00:04:26.970> south<00:04:27.270> and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
will work when you are facing south and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.840 
will work when you are facing south and
it<00:04:28.140> will<00:04:28.320> work<00:04:28.530> when<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.830> are<00:04:28.950> facing<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.700> the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
it will work when you are facing to the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.600 
it will work when you are facing to the
west<00:04:30.270> however<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.620> does<00:04:31.950> not<00:04:31.979> work<00:04:32.370> when<00:04:32.580> you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
west however it does not work when you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.029 
west however it does not work when you
are<00:04:32.729> facing<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.570> north<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.229> can<00:04:34.860> see

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
are facing to the north you can see

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.110 
are facing to the north you can see
there<00:04:35.220> when<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.400> try<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.700> get<00:04:35.850> out<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
there when I try to get out of the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.570 
there when I try to get out of the
minecart

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
minecart

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.760 
minecart
actually<00:04:36.879> puts<00:04:37.060> me<00:04:37.180> out<00:04:37.210> on<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.539> side<00:04:37.750> or<00:04:37.990> to

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
actually puts me out on this side or to

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.309 
actually puts me out on this side or to
the<00:04:38.949> east<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.270> both<00:04:40.509> of<00:04:40.539> these<00:04:40.780> don't<00:04:41.139> work

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
the east and so both of these don't work

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.689 
the east and so both of these don't work
even<00:04:41.650> though<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:41.800> can<00:04:41.979> see<00:04:42.099> that<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.340> builds

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
even though you can see that the builds

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.059 
even though you can see that the builds
are<00:04:42.789> identical<00:04:43.599> on<00:04:43.720> every<00:04:44.439> single<00:04:44.590> one<00:04:44.889> so

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
are identical on every single one so

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.020 
are identical on every single one so
that<00:04:45.219> is<00:04:45.310> something<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.580> keep<00:04:45.669> in<00:04:45.729> mind<00:04:45.879> that

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that is something to keep in mind that

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.600 
that is something to keep in mind that
it<00:04:46.150> works<00:04:46.360> west<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.229> south<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.189> in<00:04:48.460> my

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
it works west and south and in my

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.369 
it works west and south and in my
experience<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.300> what<00:04:49.360> I've<00:04:49.569> seen<00:04:49.870> when<00:04:50.110> I<00:04:50.139> do

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
experience and what I've seen when I do

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.409 
experience and what I've seen when I do
this<00:04:50.500> glitch<00:04:50.710> myself<00:04:51.159> is<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.789> it<00:04:51.909> works<00:04:52.120> best

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
this glitch myself is that it works best

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.390 
this glitch myself is that it works best
to<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.750> West<00:04:53.080> so<00:04:53.620> if<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.770> can<00:04:53.889> actually<00:04:54.099> get

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
to the West so if you can actually get

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.740 
to the West so if you can actually get
this<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.610> build<00:04:55.000> look<00:04:55.180> I'll<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.449> check<00:04:55.599> on

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
this to build look I'll just check on

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.999 
this to build look I'll just check on
your<00:04:55.870> map<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.199> make<00:04:56.289> sure<00:04:56.409> you're<00:04:56.530> facing<00:04:56.740> in

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
your map and make sure you're facing in

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.320 
your map and make sure you're facing in
the<00:04:57.099> direction<00:04:57.430> which<00:04:57.729> is<00:04:57.879> facing<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
the direction which is facing to the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.029 
the direction which is facing to the
left<00:04:58.419> where<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.229> little<00:04:59.349> guy<00:04:59.530> is<00:04:59.590> facing<00:04:59.830> to

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
left where your little guy is facing to

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.499 
left where your little guy is facing to
the<00:05:00.069> left<00:05:00.159> and<00:05:00.520> if<00:05:00.610> he's<00:05:00.759> facing<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> left

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
the left and if he's facing to the left

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.390 
the left and if he's facing to the left
it<00:05:01.689> is<00:05:02.050> going<00:05:02.139> to<00:05:02.439> work<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.710> best<00:05:02.919> but<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.340> will

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
it is going to work the best but it will

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.520 
it is going to work the best but it will
also<00:05:03.819> work<00:05:03.939> to<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.240> south<00:05:04.479> now<00:05:05.020> like<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.289> said<00:05:05.349> I

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
also work to the south now like I said I

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.110 
also work to the south now like I said I
have<00:05:05.860> had<00:05:06.009> some<00:05:06.189> difficulties<00:05:06.699> using<00:05:06.939> it<00:05:07.030> to

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
have had some difficulties using it to

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.820 
have had some difficulties using it to
the<00:05:07.210> south<00:05:07.419> where<00:05:07.930> sometimes<00:05:08.169> when<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:08.620> it

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
the south where sometimes when I do it

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.589 
the south where sometimes when I do it
like<00:05:08.919> when<00:05:09.069> I<00:05:09.099> try<00:05:09.310> to<00:05:09.340> do<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.639> over<00:05:09.759> over<00:05:10.449> there

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
like when I try to do it over over there

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.240 
like when I try to do it over over there
inside<00:05:10.930> of<00:05:11.020> that<00:05:11.110> rock<00:05:11.319> face<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:11.830> actually

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
inside of that rock face it actually

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.920 
inside of that rock face it actually
didn't<00:05:12.759> work<00:05:12.849> incredibly<00:05:13.180> well<00:05:13.569> and<00:05:13.750> it<00:05:13.840> was

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
didn't work incredibly well and it was

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.209 
didn't work incredibly well and it was
sometimes<00:05:14.110> glitchy<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.800> put<00:05:14.949> me<00:05:14.979> on<00:05:15.129> the

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:15.219 
sometimes glitchy and that put me on the

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.830 
sometimes glitchy and that put me on the
right<00:05:15.310> side<00:05:15.520> of<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.669> wall<00:05:15.849> but<00:05:16.389> I've<00:05:16.569> never

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
right side of the wall but I've never

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.420 
right side of the wall but I've never
I've<00:05:17.110> never<00:05:17.139> never<00:05:17.530> had<00:05:17.800> that<00:05:17.919> issue<00:05:18.039> going<00:05:18.280> to

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
I've never never had that issue going to

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.010 
I've never never had that issue going to
the<00:05:18.520> West<00:05:18.789> so<00:05:19.270> you're<00:05:19.419> having<00:05:19.539> any<00:05:19.719> kind<00:05:19.990> of

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
the West so you're having any kind of

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.450 
the West so you're having any kind of
problems<00:05:20.379> building<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.800> south<00:05:20.830> just<00:05:21.190> swab

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
problems building to the south just swab

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.709 
problems building to the south just swab
your<00:05:21.580> building<00:05:21.879> off<00:05:21.969> to<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.240> west<00:05:22.449> and<00:05:22.659> you

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
your building off to the west and you

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.469 
your building off to the west and you
should<00:05:23.500> be<00:05:23.680> good<00:05:23.889> to<00:05:24.039> go<00:05:24.069> now<00:05:24.759> as<00:05:24.940> far<00:05:25.150> as<00:05:25.210> the

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
should be good to go now as far as the

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.939 
should be good to go now as far as the
secret<00:05:25.780> base<00:05:25.870> entrance<00:05:26.259> goes<00:05:26.409> I<00:05:26.560> think<00:05:26.620> that

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
secret base entrance goes I think that

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.260 
secret base entrance goes I think that
that<00:05:27.159> is<00:05:27.280> about<00:05:27.400> all<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:27.819> have<00:05:27.940> for<00:05:28.090> this

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
that is about all I have for this

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.059 
that is about all I have for this
tutorial<00:05:28.719> I<00:05:28.840> don't<00:05:29.349> know<00:05:29.440> that<00:05:29.590> there<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.860> much

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
tutorial I don't know that there is much

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.040 
tutorial I don't know that there is much
more<00:05:30.279> to<00:05:30.340> say<00:05:30.610> on<00:05:30.819> it<00:05:30.849> like<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.479> said<00:05:31.719> just<00:05:31.750> make

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
more to say on it like I said just make

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.360 
more to say on it like I said just make
sure<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.259> you<00:05:32.349> hide<00:05:32.590> your<00:05:32.770> exit<00:05:33.099> a<00:05:33.129> little

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
sure that you hide your exit a little

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.129 
sure that you hide your exit a little
bit<00:05:33.460> better<00:05:33.580> than<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:33.909> did<00:05:33.969> I<00:05:34.300> know<00:05:34.599> that<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:34.930> lot

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
bit better than I did I know that a lot

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.689 
bit better than I did I know that a lot
of<00:05:35.169> people<00:05:35.500> in<00:05:35.650> my<00:05:35.770> past<00:05:36.009> tutorials<00:05:36.550> have

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
of people in my past tutorials have

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.519 
of people in my past tutorials have
actually<00:05:37.120> built<00:05:37.330> their<00:05:37.479> bases<00:05:37.930> are<00:05:38.319> their

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
actually built their bases are their

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.649 
actually built their bases are their
exits<00:05:38.949> rather<00:05:39.129> under<00:05:39.490> water<00:05:39.789> and<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.509> that

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
exits rather under water and so that

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:41.850 
exits rather under water and so that
might<00:05:40.810> be<00:05:40.900> something<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:41.199> keep<00:05:41.349> in<00:05:41.500> mind<00:05:41.680> it's

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
might be something to keep in mind it's

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.529 
might be something to keep in mind it's
just<00:05:42.039> really<00:05:42.219> as<00:05:42.460> long<00:05:42.669> as<00:05:42.969> you<00:05:43.060> can<00:05:43.180> hide<00:05:43.360> the

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
just really as long as you can hide the

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.540 
just really as long as you can hide the
exit<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:43.900> can<00:05:43.960> have<00:05:44.229> yourself<00:05:44.319> a<00:05:44.620> 100%<00:05:45.310> hidden

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
exit you can have yourself a 100% hidden

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.129 
exit you can have yourself a 100% hidden
base<00:05:45.729> and<00:05:45.969> if<00:05:46.360> you<00:05:46.449> guys<00:05:46.539> are<00:05:46.690> worried<00:05:47.020> about

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
base and if you guys are worried about

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.050 
base and if you guys are worried about
people<00:05:47.860> being<00:05:48.069> able<00:05:48.219> to<00:05:48.340> see<00:05:48.430> your<00:05:48.610> name<00:05:48.819> tag

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
people being able to see your name tag

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.519 
people being able to see your name tag
all<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.690> have<00:05:49.779> to<00:05:49.870> do<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.080> when<00:05:50.199> you're<00:05:50.319> in<00:05:50.409> the

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
all you have to do is when you're in the

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:51.869 
all you have to do is when you're in the
base<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:50.860> go<00:05:50.979> ahead<00:05:51.069> and<00:05:51.279> crouch<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.759> they

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
base just go ahead and crouch and they

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:52.890 
base just go ahead and crouch and they
won't<00:05:52.089> be<00:05:52.150> able<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.389> see<00:05:52.479> your<00:05:52.569> name<00:05:52.719> tag

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
won't be able to see your name tag

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.839 
won't be able to see your name tag
anymore<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:53.500> then<00:05:53.889> you<00:05:53.979> can<00:05:54.129> obviously<00:05:54.250> UNCHR

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
anymore and then you can obviously UNCHR

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.390 
anymore and then you can obviously UNCHR
out<00:05:54.909> once<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.360> leave<00:05:55.569> your<00:05:55.719> base<00:05:56.099> so<00:05:57.099> anyway

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
out once you leave your base so anyway

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.010 
out once you leave your base so anyway
as<00:05:57.460> far<00:05:57.639> as<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:57.819> tutorial<00:05:58.210> goes<00:05:58.389> I<00:05:58.569> think

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
as far as the tutorial goes I think

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.390 
as far as the tutorial goes I think
that's<00:05:59.199> about<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.710> for<00:05:59.830> me<00:05:59.949> I<00:05:59.979> really<00:06:00.279> do

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
that's about it for me I really do

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.740 
that's about it for me I really do
