00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 there they suddenly appear in the stands 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.500
 and they represent the oldest 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.620

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.890
 and it makes its sound noticeable 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.030
 As you can see they are dressed with their usual 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.510
 suits that according to the color indicate their 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.510

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.040
