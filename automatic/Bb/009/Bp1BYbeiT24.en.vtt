00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that note once then it might even be

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.070 
that note once then it might even be
easiest<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> throw<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.420> more<00:01:30.450> note<00:01:30.869> right

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080

that would be the low E so a a five note
bundle<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.090> sound<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.300> this

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.140 

that's<00:03:12.720> riff<00:03:12.959> three<00:03:13.260> riff<00:03:14.040> for<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.670> almost

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
that's riff three riff for is almost

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.820 
that's riff three riff for is almost
identical<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.930> except<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.680> has<00:03:16.800> a

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
identical to that except it has a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.560 
identical to that except it has a
slightly<00:03:17.190> different<00:03:17.370> picking<00:03:18.000> pattern<00:03:18.360> and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
slightly different picking pattern and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.330 
slightly different picking pattern and
it<00:03:18.630> would<00:03:18.720> sound<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:18.989> this

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:36.230 

slower

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.360 

again<00:03:37.240> still<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.810> 97<00:03:38.350> on<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:38.950> G<00:03:39.160> and

again still in the 97 on the G and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.670

ending on that eighth fret of the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.890 
ending on that eighth fret of the
b-string<00:03:41.950> just<00:03:42.670> have<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.030> double<00:03:43.570> picking

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
b-string just have the double picking

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.460 
b-string just have the double picking
style<00:03:44.200> there<00:03:45.030> riff<00:03:46.030> 5<00:03:46.390> is<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:47.200> slide

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470

four strings but I'm only going to be

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.050 
four strings but I'm only going to be
playing<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.150> B<00:04:02.110> G<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.890> D<00:04:03.220> strings<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:03.940> a

playing the B G and D strings in a

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.040 
playing the B G and D strings in a
little<00:04:04.270> pattern<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.660> would<00:04:04.780> sound<00:04:04.930> like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
little pattern that would sound like

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.530 
little pattern that would sound like
this<00:04:08.580> then<00:04:09.580> you're<00:04:09.730> gonna<00:04:09.820> move<00:04:10.030> down<00:04:10.240> to<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
this then you're gonna move down to the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.780 
this then you're gonna move down to the
twelfth<00:04:10.870> fret<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.230> repeat<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:15.280> slower<00:04:15.640> on

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
twelfth fret and repeat it so slower on

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:25.030 
twelfth fret and repeat it so slower on
that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.879 

ref<00:04:26.040> six<00:04:26.400> takes<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:27.000> into<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.780> outro<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.530> the

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
ref six takes you into the outro of the

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.670 
ref six takes you into the outro of the
song<00:04:29.240> again<00:04:30.240> you're<00:04:30.780> back<00:04:30.960> down<00:04:31.260> here<00:04:31.440> at<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
song again you're back down here at the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.010 
song again you're back down here at the
nine<00:04:31.860> seven<00:04:32.310> on<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.490> G<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:33.479> pattern<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:33.990> a

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
nine seven on the G the pattern is a

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.480 
nine seven on the G the pattern is a
little<00:04:34.080> different<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.919> involves<00:04:35.400> a

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
little different and it involves a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:58.489 
little different and it involves a
vibrato<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.060> let<00:04:36.389> me<00:04:36.479> play<00:04:36.630> that<00:04:46.400> slower

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:01.350 

then<00:04:59.499> riff<00:04:59.710> 7<00:05:00.129> is<00:05:00.370> gonna<00:05:00.699> be<00:05:00.819> a<00:05:00.849> little<00:05:00.969> trill

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
then riff 7 is gonna be a little trill

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360 
then riff 7 is gonna be a little trill
down<00:05:01.599> here<00:05:01.900> at<00:05:02.020> this<00:05:02.169> second<00:05:02.590> fret<00:05:02.830> on<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.069> D

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
down here at this second fret on the D

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.610 
down here at this second fret on the D
string<00:05:03.479> which<00:05:04.479> is<00:05:04.629> hammering<00:05:05.080> on<00:05:05.259> and<00:05:05.499> pulling

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
string which is hammering on and pulling

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.010 
string which is hammering on and pulling
off<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.129> open<00:05:06.699> string<00:05:06.969> and<00:05:07.689> it<00:05:07.779> would<00:05:07.870> sound

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
off to open string and it would sound

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.709 
off to open string and it would sound
like<00:05:08.080> this

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:22.580 

slower

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.140 

and<00:05:23.590> then<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.919> final<00:05:24.280> sound<00:05:24.460> of<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.730> song<00:05:24.940> is

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
and then the final sound of the song is

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.270 
and then the final sound of the song is
the<00:05:25.480> little<00:05:25.720> slide<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.169> runs<00:05:26.350> up<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
the little slide that runs up the the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.680 
the little slide that runs up the the
entire<00:05:27.610> neck<00:05:27.910> there<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.150> happen<00:05:28.480> to<00:05:28.540> have<00:05:28.630> a

entire neck there I happen to have a

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.470 
entire neck there I happen to have a
slide<00:05:28.930> for<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:29.410> I'll<00:05:29.530> play<00:05:29.680> that<00:05:29.889> for<00:05:30.100> you

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
rather than just stopping at the end of

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.379 
rather than just stopping at the end of
the<00:05:33.040> neck<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.370> may<00:05:33.520> even<00:05:33.639> want<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.000> run<00:05:34.180> the
