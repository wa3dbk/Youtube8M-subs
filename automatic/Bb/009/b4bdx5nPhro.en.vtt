standpoint<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> start<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:35.610> let<00:01:36.299> me<00:01:36.390> put

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
standpoint so to start off let me put

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.039 
standpoint so to start off let me put
the<00:01:36.810> Box<00:01:37.049> down<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.549> start<00:01:41.790> off<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
the Box down so to start off we have a

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
the Box down so to start off we have a
high<00:01:46.049> model<00:01:47.509> with<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.960> all<00:01:49.140> flying<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.680> it's

high model with it's all flying it it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.190 
high model with it's all flying it it's
again<00:01:51.079> Kobe<00:01:52.079> 9<00:01:52.579> not<00:01:53.579> real<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.390> runner<00:01:54.780> flying

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
again Kobe 9 not real like runner flying

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
again Kobe 9 not real like runner flying
it<00:01:56.210> like<00:01:57.210> um<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:58.560> runners<00:01:59.030> that<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.210> came

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
it like um the runners that they came

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
it like um the runners that they came
out<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.350> fact<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.490> fuse

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
out with it's more like fact with fuse

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.870 
out with it's more like fact with fuse
on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.479> inside<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.219> stability<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
on the inside to get more stability so I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930 
on the inside to get more stability so I
can<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.119> why<00:02:06.240> they<00:02:06.360> did<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
can see why they did that but the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.339 
can see why they did that but the
traction<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.629> really<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:10.020> there's<00:02:10.200> always

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
traction is really good there's always

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.990 
traction is really good there's always
like<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:11.209> nubs

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
like little nubs

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.350 
like little nubs

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.330 
but yeah yeah I don't even know if it's
all<00:02:37.990> exhume<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.530> think<00:02:38.740> it's<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.920> zoom<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
all exhume I think it's a zoom in the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.520 
all exhume I think it's a zoom in the
heel<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:40.030> yeah<00:02:40.270> there's<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
heel but yeah there's that for the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.730 
heel but yeah there's that for the
performance<00:02:42.300> it's<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.900> strictly

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
performance it's for strictly

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.980 
performance it's for strictly
performance<00:02:45.400> I'm<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.270> gonna<00:02:46.420> say<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
performance I'm not gonna say this is

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.490 
performance I'm not gonna say this is
worth<00:02:47.140> it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
worth it

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.060 
worth it
I<00:02:47.530> think<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> low<00:02:48.280> top<00:02:48.580> does<00:02:48.850> just<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.270> well

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
I think the low top does just as well

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.220 
I think the low top does just as well
not<00:02:51.070> even<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.459> low<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> normal

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
not even the low like just the normal

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.100 
not even the low like just the normal
low<00:02:53.410> like<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> hundred<00:02:54.430> eighty<00:02:54.490> bucks<00:02:55.110> does

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
low like a hundred eighty bucks does

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.500 
low like a hundred eighty bucks does
well<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.890> feel<00:02:57.040> like<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.670> shoe<00:02:57.880> looks
