wrong<00:01:14.460> uh<00:01:16.790> flash<00:01:17.790> red<00:01:19.430> then<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
wrong uh flash red then you have to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
wrong uh flash red then you have to
count<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.270> many<00:01:21.479> times<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.020> clashes<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
count how many times it clashes and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399 
count how many times it clashes and
that's<00:01:22.890> however<00:01:23.280> many<00:01:23.580> points<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.140> if

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that's however many points you get if

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.830 
that's however many points you get if
they<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.890> flash<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> same<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.689> we

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
they all flash at the same time and we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.399 
they all flash at the same time and we
got<00:01:28.080> ten<00:01:28.350> points<00:01:29.270> next<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> called<00:01:30.990> Simon

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
got ten points next one is called Simon

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.710 
got ten points next one is called Simon
lights<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:33.020> lights<00:01:34.020> off<00:01:34.520> okay<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
lights out lights off okay so you got to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
lights out lights off okay so you got to
rearrange<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.320> blocks<00:01:37.439> until<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
rearrange the blocks until one of the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
rearrange the blocks until one of the
one<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.119> turn<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:44.270> see<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.540> couldn't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
one of them turn off see I just couldn't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.630 
one of them turn off see I just couldn't
get<00:01:46.020> them<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.350> off<00:01:46.909> slowly<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.750> I

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
get them all off slowly one off so I

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
get them all off slowly one off so I
think<00:01:50.640> once<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.509> gotta<00:01:51.689> keep<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
think once it's off you gotta keep it in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.889 
think once it's off you gotta keep it in
that<00:01:52.259> position<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:59.479> 90<00:02:00.479> seconds

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that position so and you have 90 seconds

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.039 
that position so and you have 90 seconds
so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> do<00:02:02.450> if<00:02:03.450> you're<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.990> you
