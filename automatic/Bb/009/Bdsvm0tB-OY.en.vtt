00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 First, we need a kilo 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:23.659

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.230
 I'll margarine the eggs and butter 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.230
 Listen sugar properly 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.910
 Sun sank the sea at that, I then 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.910
 left in there 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.190
 i have my day on mine 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.280
 sheet metal plates speak and evaluate these 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.770
 then bake at 21 degrees about 20 minutes 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.990
 so now I prepare my peace before 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.990
 as it stands on the packaging I 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.780
 have measured 500 milliliters of milk 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.450

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.610
 given bauble and then have mine 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.330
 Add people for the honda and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.570

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.180
 then I leave the remaining milk 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.649
 Cook 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.110
 Here are my milk with the powder 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.960

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.760
 on the hot stove plate that touches 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.760
 whole 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.620
 that is something to break again 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.209
 Now I will do the repo again 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.670

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.250
