00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
which i thought was quite nice and yeah

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.080 
which i thought was quite nice and yeah
thought<00:01:11.220> it'd<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> case<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
thought it'd just be a case like this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.040 
thought it'd just be a case like this
but<00:01:13.880> obviously<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> like

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
but obviously it's not because it's like

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.450 
but obviously it's not because it's like
