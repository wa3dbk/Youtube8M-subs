00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
like to show you my latest project which

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.070 
like to show you my latest project which
is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.710> module<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:12.469> control<00:00:13.469> my<00:00:13.769> Linux<00:00:14.190> desktop

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
is a module to control my Linux desktop

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
is a module to control my Linux desktop
using<00:00:16.080> my<00:00:16.529> hands<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:18.320> this<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
using my hands and this is actually the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.730 
using my hands and this is actually the
source<00:00:20.880> code<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.869> written<00:00:22.439> Python<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.689> it's

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
source code it's written Python and it's

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.060 
source code it's written Python and it's
it<00:00:25.740> makes<00:00:25.980> use<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:28.170> device<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it makes use of this this device here is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.870 
it makes use of this this device here is
we<00:00:29.310> will<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:30.390> called<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.289> leap<00:00:31.560> motion<00:00:31.880> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
we will think called a leap motion it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.220 
we will think called a leap motion it's
actually<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> very<00:00:34.790> very<00:00:35.790> nice<00:00:36.000> capture<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
actually a very very nice capture and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.770 
actually a very very nice capture and
what<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.160> does<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.790> recognizes<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
what it does is it recognizes the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
what it does is it recognizes the
movement<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.649> hand<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.700> three

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
movement of your hand in three

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.709 
movement of your hand in three
dimensions<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.379> translates<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.370> into

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
dimensions and it translates that into

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
dimensions and it translates that into
events<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.530> read<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
events that you can then read with the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.250 
events that you can then read with the
API<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> ships<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:50.329> I'm<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> turn

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
API that it ships with I'm going to turn

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.520 
API that it ships with I'm going to turn
on<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:53.489> flashy<00:00:54.120> mouth<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> see

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
on this flashy mouth so that you can see

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.240 
on this flashy mouth so that you can see
the<00:00:56.370> movement<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.989> mouse<00:00:58.199> pointer<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the movement of the mouse pointer on the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330 
the movement of the mouse pointer on the
screen<00:00:59.930> sorry<00:01:00.930> if<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.230> distracting<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
screen sorry if it is distracting but I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.140 
screen sorry if it is distracting but I
think<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:07.130> well<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> found<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
think so the well I found what I got to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050 
think so the well I found what I got to
be<00:01:09.270> motion<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:11.369> doesn't<00:01:11.610> come<00:01:11.880> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
be motion is that it doesn't come with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
be motion is that it doesn't come with
any<00:01:12.090> software<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.720> laners<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> thought

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
any software for laners which I thought

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
any software for laners which I thought
was<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.280> disappointing<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.420> even<00:01:16.020> for

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
was very disappointing and even for

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.039 
was very disappointing and even for
Windows<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.830> doesn't<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.820> proper<00:01:18.150> desk

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Windows it doesn't have a proper desk

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
Windows it doesn't have a proper desk
top<00:01:19.350> navigation<00:01:20.159> system<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.420> think

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
top navigation system which is I think

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
top navigation system which is I think
the<00:01:22.170> first<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> do<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the first thing that you do with a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.469 
the first thing that you do with a
device<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.090> would<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
device like this you would like to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
device like this you would like to
control<00:01:24.840> your<00:01:24.960> desktop<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.060> I've

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
control your desktop with it and so I've

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
control your desktop with it and so I've
been<00:01:27.240> working<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:28.200> using<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.369> API<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:32.700> come

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
been working on using the API to to come

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.340 
been working on using the API to to come
up<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.409> something<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
up with something like that so as you

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
up with something like that so as you
can<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.799> some<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> basic<00:01:39.060> things<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.450> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
can see some of the basic things that I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.590 
can see some of the basic things that I
can<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.770> move<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.030> mouse

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
can do here is I can move the mouse

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.850 
can do here is I can move the mouse
pointer<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.549> grab<00:01:44.790> windows<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
pointer I can grab windows and

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.370 
pointer I can grab windows and
those<00:01:46.010> windows<00:01:46.430> alone<00:01:48.970> windows<00:01:49.970> here<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:51.140> my

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
those windows alone windows here with my

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.540 
those windows alone windows here with my
pointer<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.280> could<00:01:52.790> even<00:01:52.910> make<00:01:53.210> clicks<00:01:53.720> by

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
pointer I could even make clicks by

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.410 
pointer I could even make clicks by
going<00:01:57.490> moving<00:01:58.490> my<00:01:58.580> finger<00:01:59.030> towards<00:01:59.330> the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
going moving my finger towards the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.460 
going moving my finger towards the
screen<00:02:00.880> but<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.240> nothing<00:02:02.600> very<00:02:03.020> very

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
screen but that's nothing very very

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.630 
screen but that's nothing very very
convenient<00:02:05.680> so<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:06.710> can<00:02:06.950> grab<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.280> window

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
convenient so I can grab the window

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.699 
convenient so I can grab the window
something<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:10.759> this<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.900> record<00:02:12.290> window

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
something like this I can record window

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.199 
something like this I can record window
and<00:02:13.100> throw<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.910> away

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
and throw it away

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.900 
and throw it away
and<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.990> means<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.130> meaning<00:02:16.700> gets

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
and that means that the meaning gets

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.600 
and that means that the meaning gets
minimized<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.800> debug<00:02:19.100> mode<00:02:19.130> right

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
minimized but it's in debug mode right

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.180 
minimized but it's in debug mode right
now<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.990> needs<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> minimize<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.010> then

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
now so it needs to minimize and then

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.920 
now so it needs to minimize and then
it's<00:02:22.370> thrown<00:02:22.940> back<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.450> screen<00:02:23.630> that's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
it's thrown back of the screen that's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.890 
it's thrown back of the screen that's
something<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.500> meant<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.610> way<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.160> back

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
something I meant that way in the back

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:42.550 
something I meant that way in the back
so<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.580> very<00:02:40.780> sensitive

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
so it is and so it is very sensitive

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.770 
so it is and so it is very sensitive
it<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.070> pretty<00:02:43.400> accurate<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:47.060> we<00:02:47.750> can

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
it is pretty accurate and we can we can

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.240 
it is pretty accurate and we can we can
do<00:02:48.110> there's<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.440> lot<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.650> things<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.100> can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
do there's a lot of things that you can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.780 
do there's a lot of things that you can
do<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.550> it<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.910> recognizes<00:02:50.450> lots<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
do with it it recognizes lots of

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.770 
do with it it recognizes lots of
gestures<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.820> things<00:02:53.269> like<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:55.780> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
gestures and things like that and the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.330 
gestures and things like that and the
Python<00:02:57.230> API<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:58.070> very<00:02:58.580> good<00:02:58.970> only<00:02:59.810> from

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
Python API is very good only from

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.690 
Python API is very good only from
there<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:02.920> relatively<00:03:03.220> easy<00:03:03.430> to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
there so so it's relatively easy to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.990 
there so so it's relatively easy to
write<00:03:04.060> applications<00:03:04.569> for<00:03:05.170> Eclipse

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
write applications for Eclipse

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.300 
write applications for Eclipse
sometimes<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:08.020> takes<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.349> bit<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.500> practice<00:03:08.770> to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
sometimes it takes a bit of practice to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.440 
sometimes it takes a bit of practice to
get<00:03:10.239> used<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.840> new<00:03:10.900> way<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.550> things

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
get used to this new way of things

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.199 
get used to this new way of things
another<00:03:13.900> thing<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.260> do<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.970> with<00:03:15.970> this

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
another thing you can do is with this

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.790 
another thing you can do is with this
module<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.349> bring<00:03:17.530> up<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
module is that we can bring up the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.850 
module is that we can bring up the
desktop<00:03:18.069> by<00:03:18.280> putting<00:03:19.000> your<00:03:19.120> hand<00:03:19.269> like<00:03:19.420> this

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
desktop by putting your hand like this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.050 
desktop by putting your hand like this
go<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.209> any<00:03:23.099> we<00:03:24.099> know<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.819> open

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
go to any we know that you like to open

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.370 
go to any we know that you like to open
and<00:03:25.390> then<00:03:25.569> open<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.230> directly<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:28.450> then<00:03:29.110> as

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
and then open it directly and then as

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.180 
and then open it directly and then as
you<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.709> seen<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.940> also<00:03:31.090> do<00:03:32.050> rotations<00:03:32.890> of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you have seen I can also do rotations of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.800 
you have seen I can also do rotations of
my<00:03:33.519> hand<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.769> switch<00:03:36.580> tests<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.330> things<00:03:37.630> like

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
my hand to switch tests and things like

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.840 
my hand to switch tests and things like
that<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:40.090> have<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.540> be<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:41.640> bit<00:03:42.640> careful

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
that you have to be a bit careful

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.030 
that you have to be a bit careful
because<00:03:43.090> I've<00:03:43.569> seen<00:03:43.930> that<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:46.450> uses<00:03:46.630> infrared

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
because I've seen that it uses infrared

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.339 
because I've seen that it uses infrared
infrared<00:03:48.040> light<00:03:48.280> from<00:03:48.310> from<00:03:49.180> your<00:03:49.390> hand<00:03:49.900> and

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
infrared light from from your hand and

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.680 
infrared light from from your hand and
he<00:03:50.739> can<00:03:50.950> he<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.459> be<00:03:51.610> confused<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.330> there's<00:03:52.540> a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
he can he can be confused if there's a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.930 
he can he can be confused if there's a
lot<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.840> infrared<00:03:53.580> background<00:03:54.580> in<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
lot of infrared background in the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.600 
lot of infrared background in the
environment<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.069> right<00:03:57.069> now<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.430> not<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
environment and right now this is not a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.490 
environment and right now this is not a
very<00:03:57.880> good<00:03:58.030> location<00:03:58.209> because<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.230> set

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
very good location because I have it set

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.170 
very good location because I have it set
right<00:04:00.099> next<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:03.250> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
right next to the to the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.380 
right next to the to the
to<00:04:04.629> my<00:04:04.780> laptop<00:04:05.049> fan<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.489> getting<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.790> lot

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
to my laptop fan so it's getting a lot

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.420 
to my laptop fan so it's getting a lot
of<00:04:07.450> hot<00:04:07.959> air<00:04:08.200> blown<00:04:08.560> right<00:04:08.829> into<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.159> device

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
of hot air blown right into the device

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.819 
of hot air blown right into the device
but<00:04:10.000> still<00:04:10.299> as<00:04:10.840> you<00:04:10.959> can<00:04:11.079> see<00:04:11.260> it's<00:04:11.560> pretty

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
but still as you can see it's pretty

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.300 
but still as you can see it's pretty
accurate<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:13.859> pretty<00:04:14.859> nice<00:04:15.129> as<00:04:15.310> well<00:04:15.489> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
accurate and pretty nice as well the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.170 
accurate and pretty nice as well the
things<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:20.970> well<00:04:21.970> that's

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
things like that so well that's

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.580 
things like that so well that's
basically<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.050> very<00:04:23.259> experimental

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
basically this is a very experimental

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.249 
basically this is a very experimental
modules<00:04:24.370> -<00:04:24.580> there's<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:25.449> lot<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.870> very<00:04:26.110> nice

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
modules - there's a lot of very nice

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.350 
modules - there's a lot of very nice
things<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.889> you<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.130> do<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.850> can<00:04:28.030> consid

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
things that you can do you can consid

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.080 
things that you can do you can consid
with<00:04:28.509> this<00:04:28.660> device<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:30.550> conceive<00:04:30.880> an

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
with this device you can conceive an

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.749 
with this device you can conceive an
interface<00:04:31.930> kind<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.470> like<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.919> one<00:04:33.250> that<00:04:33.520> we

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
interface kind of like the one that we

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.370 
interface kind of like the one that we
see<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.060> science<00:04:34.389> fiction<00:04:34.660> movies<00:04:35.169> like

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
see in science fiction movies like

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.650 
see in science fiction movies like
Minority<00:04:35.949> Report<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:36.910> things<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:37.389> that

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
Minority Report and things like that

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:46.920 
Minority Report and things like that
where<00:04:38.259> you<00:04:38.289> can<00:04:44.130> then<00:04:45.130> toss<00:04:45.759> it<00:04:45.789> away

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
where you can then toss it away

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.740 
where you can then toss it away
that<00:04:47.380> some<00:04:47.650> things<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:51.610> what<00:04:51.849> I<00:04:52.090> think<00:04:52.449> that's

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
that some things so what I think that's

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.180 
that some things so what I think that's
it<00:04:53.580> being<00:04:54.580> working<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:55.840> for<00:04:56.139> a<00:04:56.740> couple<00:04:57.009> of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
it being working this for a couple of

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.140 
it being working this for a couple of
days<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:59.590> think<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.699> has<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.910> lot<00:05:01.090> of

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
days and I think it has a lot of

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.810 
days and I think it has a lot of
potential<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.740> basically<00:05:03.220> what<00:05:03.699> I've

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
potential this is basically what I've

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.050 
potential this is basically what I've
done<00:05:03.970> here<00:05:04.300> is<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.660> quick<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.080> dirty<00:05:05.320> hack<00:05:06.060> it's

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
done here is a quick and dirty hack it's

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.969 
done here is a quick and dirty hack it's
not<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.570> smartest<00:05:08.169> way<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.500> doing<00:05:08.770> things

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
not the smartest way of doing things

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.930 
not the smartest way of doing things
using<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.960> X<00:05:11.229> do<00:05:11.440> tool<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:13.380> translate<00:05:14.380> these

but<00:05:22.810> I'm<00:05:23.110> sure<00:05:23.289> there's<00:05:24.389> much<00:05:25.389> more<00:05:25.570> efficient

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
but I'm sure there's much more efficient

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.740 
but I'm sure there's much more efficient
ways<00:05:26.229> to<00:05:26.260> do<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:28.180> I'm<00:05:28.300> really<00:05:28.330> looking

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
ways to do it so I'm really looking

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.689 
ways to do it so I'm really looking
forward<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.320> other<00:05:29.830> applications<00:05:30.130> that

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
forward to other applications that

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.719 
forward to other applications that
people<00:05:30.849> won't<00:05:31.240> do<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:32.340> think<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.400> would<00:05:33.490> be<00:05:33.550> very

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
people won't do I think it would be very

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.670 
people won't do I think it would be very
nice<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.120> have<00:05:34.210> a<00:05:34.270> real<00:05:35.020> three-dimensional

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
nice to have a real three-dimensional

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.999 
nice to have a real three-dimensional
desktop<00:05:36.550> where<00:05:36.759> you<00:05:37.419> can<00:05:37.599> have<00:05:37.870> Windows<00:05:38.800> with

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
desktop where you can have Windows with

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.940 
desktop where you can have Windows with
depth<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.849> you<00:05:40.030> can<00:05:40.270> you<00:05:41.020> can<00:05:41.050> base

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
depth and you can you can base

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.670 
depth and you can you can base
grabbing<00:05:42.760> we<00:05:42.910> know<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.420> he's<00:05:43.540> fourth<00:05:44.290> down

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
grabbing we know that he's fourth down

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.330 
grabbing we know that he's fourth down
and<00:05:45.330> pull<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.360> out<00:05:46.540> we<00:05:46.720> bring<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.140> up<00:05:47.230> that<00:05:48.130> sort

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
and pull it out we bring it up that sort

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.580 
and pull it out we bring it up that sort
of<00:05:48.370> things<00:05:48.640> I<00:05:48.940> think<00:05:49.300> that's<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.750> future<00:05:50.170> with

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
of things I think that's the future with

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.700 
of things I think that's the future with
this<00:05:50.740> kind<00:05:50.980> of<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.640> interfaces<00:05:52.470> well<00:05:53.470> that's

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
this kind of the interfaces well that's

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.400 
this kind of the interfaces well that's
basically<00:05:53.980> it<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:54.940> hope<00:05:55.780> you<00:05:55.900> liked<00:05:56.110> it<00:05:56.230> and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
basically it I hope you liked it and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.280 
basically it I hope you liked it and
thanks<00:05:57.100> for<00:05:57.220> watching
