00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.359
 the bazaar 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.780
 well in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.559
 find the skull 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.559
 in your daddy in the halo game 3 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.099
 and good you have to go to the phase of 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:27.400
 covenant towards the final part where 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.400
 there are all these seven rings in total 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.090
 and you have to jump through 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.510
 some of these rings following a 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 sequence determined that right now you 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.340
 I 'll show it down here in the video 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.830
 there you have it 46 54 534 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.540
 ok now I'm jumping for the ring 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.540
 number 4 which is the intermediate ring 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.490
 We can number the rings from the 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.760
 elevator number 1 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.950
 to the bottom where is where is the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.060
 prophet that would be number seven 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.280
 then we are counting 1 2 3 to 7 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.680
 this is ring 6 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.780
 the one that follows is the 7 that's why it does not 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 no jumping, no need to jump 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.560
 for the first two 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.610
 and well you see what 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.710
 following this sequence 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.230
 we move mostly on this part 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.230
 now it's ring number 5 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.299
 the next one is 4 on 4 also if you 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.990
 you set to take it as a reference 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.200
 have 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.130
 and a strip of red color that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.130
 difference from others 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.360
 alright now back to number 5 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.400
 and then only 3 and 4 are missing if 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.460
 you follow the steps as they are in the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.960
 video the skull will appear 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 safely 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.300
 look here 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.610
 and we jump by number 3 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.610
 and it is only back to 4 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 to this it is as we know we have 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.510
 done well look at the rings light up 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.079
 intermittently the seven rings 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.569
 they light up okay this means that 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.950
 the skull has appeared where is the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.459
 skull in the bottom portion 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.470
 in front of the light bridge let's say in the 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.769
 sector where you meet the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.769
 prophet 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.520
 so good you just have to 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.280
 will go to this part and catch the skull 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.550
 creating there is there is there is the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.550
