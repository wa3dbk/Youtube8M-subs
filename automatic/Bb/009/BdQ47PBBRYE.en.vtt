00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.290
 if what you want to do is a standard 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.589
 more giant in the cabin and a place 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:18.120
 where you can play the cd in weapons are you 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:18.120
 in the indicated channel let's start 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.540
 Y 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.940
 with bars eyes grills bone powder 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.100
 trees any something that you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:48.750
 like and signals frames and grip glasses 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.269
 or signs and frames good if you want 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 do that is deciding first let's go 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.670
 to need to close make as if a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.890
 small sample of closed all over the place 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.150
 to close the whole place it serves as 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.010
 for 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.500
 approach 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.590
 give more ambience to the game as the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.869
 normal one man train 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.480
 there has not been to plant a tree 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.900
 and they will put it 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.870
 growing is very easy but in 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.420
 growing like that a lot of trees 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.450
 and now we put more much more 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.200
 atmosphere that will be much grass in 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.100
 whole place 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.719
 what is all they can do to make 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.719
 merman is a bit 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.180
 and well then well they will stay 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.990
 and they will also need 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.970
 what is called gravel 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.950
 my jug whatever 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 now as in the species of the road to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 which is not going to take you there 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 nowhere 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.329
 to which is a very silly way what 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.299
 is going to try now is a poster to which 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.299
 you can put whatever you take 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.420
 well, he's going to come in and he's going to say 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.620
 goodbye I found the note takes it out and it 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.210
 takes it 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.890
 and if they want to do something similar in 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.680
 sell stain that not a box 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.720
 that is similar to him and well then well 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 it's going to be like I have it I 'm in a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 want I put a cabin and here goes to

 little is for the players they are going to put 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.930
 a chest in which everything you can 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.420
 to do is to maintain ourselves by others of with 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.300
 eyes 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.510
 and armors to defend themselves from weapons 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.870
 now to do is sell hand goes to 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.870

 obsidian that is for shoes like 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.190
