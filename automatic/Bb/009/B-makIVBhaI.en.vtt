00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.500
 welcome all channel michael h and 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:10.019
 today is another base for 7 than the hall 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.799
 it is based on both honor and structure 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.140
 as you see, let's show you quickly 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.689
 you build it in the center, we put our 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.580
 black elixir vault since i 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.289
 again farmly black elixir to burn 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.769
 your cards for so still smart 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.220
 punish the first level I want the same 2 me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.570
 need 12,500 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.720
 elixir so we are sure 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.100
 strange thing is difficult to the available space in 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:51.040
 the very middle of the heart of our base 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:55.700
 everything else is already located around 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.800
 such an asymmetric base geometrically 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.010
 right nothing like that 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.210
 I don't have the supernatural 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.760
 we set traps between ours 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.030
 shooting moods between our 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.920
 defenders necessarily bombs which 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.700
 we also need to deliver now 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.570
 bombs and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.420
 around we will finish building the structure 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.420
 quietly take out of our base 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.280
 it's quick pretty now 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.720
 deliver the structure 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.410
 and I will definitely show you my attacks on 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.940
 this base 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:52.200
 I have basically only 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 finish mine all mine and stay king 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.400
 honestly i don't know was not interested 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:04.650
 if the third level is king for tx 5 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 but time will tell me there is still there 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.300
 6 hours so he plunged from me and you can 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.060
 will be already look further so let's 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.060
 look 65 cents attack on base 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:27.180
 attacking with fifth bows a fly has flown to me 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.560
 I asked to protect the bows or balls to me 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.560
 someone threw geeks 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 to protect hygiene to protect it at all 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.830
 just something incredible just 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.370
 see how they jump pulled out 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.490
 in general labor 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.500
 no amount at all 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.500
 the enemy dunk this money flies 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 now she lures everything lures not 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:04.329
 fit how do you clean brow ok 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.420
 here he is now soak you gigov from 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:11.970
 nothing will be left for a century 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:19.030
 understand what happened he releases his 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:24.760
 giants produce flies flies wets a lot 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.189
 rdf hygiene sneaks on comes to 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.609
 our sorcerer kills about 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:36.909
 and the moment of truth and about how many there are two 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:44.579
 too small rdf kills from that side 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.579
 hand flies flies 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.959
 got to the black elixir and 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.290
 Thank God rdf we do not sleep kills 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.530
 all flies, we still have the main 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.519
 number of black letters 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.310
 giants are trying to do something further there 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.530
 break the walls how many have we come with 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.580
 only 1 2 3 wall broads not so 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.160
 just let him have their remnants 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.540
 thinks maybe something can catch 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 no this and bows 3 flies 5 barbarian 5 hygiene and 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.970
 fourth bombers 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.919
 and so on in general, the base itself showed 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.300
 quite good four plus 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.740
 pyaterochka pyaterochka on not previously you 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.169
 will be first let's start with 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.419
 that this army is higher than the army of this base 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.419
 which can be held on pyaterochka you 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:51.389
 Anyone looking next so 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.389
 launches gigs he launched a bomber 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.430
 kills in on rdf flew away 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:07.680
 one giant launches angel pierced 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.990
 parallel he is a giant report yes and he 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.099
 no decide to go network and weird maneuver 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.129
 generally very first after to the gun then 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:20.699
 noticed that we have a card 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.409
 Tesla can also be beaten for the first time. 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.940
 I see this is not the first thing that one 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:30.240
 side and then change your mind 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.870
 but generally unique so that we have 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.919
 further flew a couple of pieces he launches 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.470
 managed to gain 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:45.840
 King 2 came over there and now 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.530
 we got the nastiest goblins 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.969
 who stole as much as 700 units from me 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.729
 I just lacked everything 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:58.710
 Diet 60 units to 12 thousand five hundred 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.280
 fix so i had to do 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.340
 a few more so I just put it off for now 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.780
 the army is done at the kiss waited while it 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.639
 do to attack and here I have 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.250
 covered in 700 units 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:17.219
 elixir here attacked mbit 4 army from 4 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.069
 the army did not keep us our base 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:24.420
 for some reason I feel the fifth holding back and 4 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:28.590
 not kept now we see who it is 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.990
 but this 8 got us on according to what 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.280
 I liked the base which time 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.970
 make sure that 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.210
 and clean structures for bo 7 than hall 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.070
 this is the very same thing because so far 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.170
 then attack me often and when 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:46.170
 giants giants are very good 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:49.140
 hold up the fences with this in general arrange 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.370
 imagine this base will improve if 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.920
 do you have any suggestions for 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.320
 improvement of this base is necessary 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.300
 write in the comments discuss with you 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.550
 It will be very interesting to subscribe to 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.950
