00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that I'd worked the science into the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
and really into science and learning

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.570 
and really into science and learning
they'll<00:01:13.140> come<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.680> ask<00:01:13.920> me<00:01:14.070> questions
