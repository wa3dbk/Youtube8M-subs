00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
nice open area that I can work with this

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
nice open area that I can work with this
box<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.340> can<00:02:26.519> try<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> reach<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.090> inside

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
box in so I can try to reach out inside

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
now with that lose the airbox you saw it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.440 
now with that lose the airbox you saw it
just<00:02:57.380> kind<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.740> fell<00:02:57.920> way<00:02:58.130> there<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:59.180> still

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
just kind of fell way there it's still

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.300 
just kind of fell way there it's still
inside<00:02:59.780> there<00:02:59.990> we<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.350> need<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.650> figure<00:03:01.160> out

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
inside there we just need to figure out

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.950 
inside there we just need to figure out
a<00:03:01.340> way<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.520> work<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.880> out<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.300> if<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.840> it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
a way to work it out and if you do it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.940 
a way to work it out and if you do it
this<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.470> right<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:04.520> tilt<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.030> turn<00:03:05.180> this

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
this just right you tilt and turn this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.420 
this just right you tilt and turn this
there<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:06.980> go

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
there you go

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.270 
there you go
the<00:03:07.970> airbox<00:03:08.270> will<00:03:08.480> come<00:03:08.630> out<00:03:08.780> completely<00:03:09.280> so

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
the airbox will come out completely so

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.640 
the airbox will come out completely so
now<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.520> I<00:03:10.640> have<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> airbox<00:03:11.240> out<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.840> can<00:03:12.530> go

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
now that I have the airbox out I can go

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.500 
now that I have the airbox out I can go
ahead<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.920> start<00:03:13.160> thinking<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.730> replacing

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
ahead and start thinking about replacing

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.140 
ahead and start thinking about replacing
it<00:03:14.900> with<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.110> conical<00:03:15.410> air<00:03:15.650> filter<00:03:16.150> replacing

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
it with the conical air filter replacing

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.700 
it with the conical air filter replacing
with<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.300> conical<00:03:17.690> air<00:03:17.870> filter<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.350> quite<00:03:18.560> easy

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
with a conical air filter is quite easy

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.180 
with a conical air filter is quite easy
in<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.040> case<00:03:19.150> I've<00:03:20.150> removed<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:21.190> intake

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
in this case I've removed the intake

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.650 
in this case I've removed the intake
manifold<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:22.820> I<00:03:22.850> have<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> carburetor

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
manifold so I have the carburetor

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.810 
manifold so I have the carburetor
exposed<00:03:24.020> directly<00:03:24.470> from<00:03:24.590> behind<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.460> I

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
exposed directly from behind here and I

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.670 
exposed directly from behind here and I
have<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> clear<00:03:26.390> visible<00:03:26.810> sight<00:03:27.020> to<00:03:27.260> see<00:03:27.290> this

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
have a clear visible sight to see this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.910 
have a clear visible sight to see this
this<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.730> a<00:03:28.820> 42<00:03:29.240> millimeter<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.650> will<00:03:30.770> fit

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
this is a 42 millimeter and it will fit

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
this is a 42 millimeter and it will fit
right<00:03:31.070> over<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.400> opening<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.910> that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
right over the opening of that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.500 
right over the opening of that
carburetor<00:03:32.830> which<00:03:33.830> allows<00:03:34.100> me<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.280> just<00:03:35.240> snap

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
carburetor which allows me to just snap

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.370 
carburetor which allows me to just snap
that<00:03:35.720> right<00:03:35.870> into<00:03:36.050> place

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
that right into place

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.040 
that right into place
and<00:03:36.680> rotate<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:39.200> pipe<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:41.050> clamp

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
and rotate the the pipe of the clamp

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.860 
and rotate the the pipe of the clamp
here<00:03:44.800> now<00:03:45.800> once<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.100> rotate<00:03:46.460> that<00:03:46.490> clamp<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:47.270> can

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
here now once I rotate that clamp I can

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.810 
here now once I rotate that clamp I can
then<00:03:48.020> just<00:03:48.200> take<00:03:48.380> my<00:03:48.530> screwdriver<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.280> go

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
then just take my screwdriver and go

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:58.160 
then just take my screwdriver and go
through<00:03:50.030> there<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:51.280> tighten<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.490> clamp<00:03:52.820> up

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.220 

yeah<00:03:59.250> it's<00:04:00.250> good<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.520> solid<00:04:00.900> so<00:04:01.900> that's<00:04:02.080> all

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
yeah it's good and solid so that's all

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.130 
yeah it's good and solid so that's all
there<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:03.090> installing<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.540> air<00:04:04.750> filter

what<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.360> did<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.930> drilled<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.230> few<00:05:02.260> extra

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
what I did is I drilled a few extra

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.470 
what I did is I drilled a few extra
holes<00:05:02.950> in<00:05:03.130> there<00:05:03.310> so<00:05:03.940> that<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.120> could<00:05:04.300> actually

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
holes in there so that I could actually

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.150 
holes in there so that I could actually
put<00:05:04.660> some<00:05:04.990> screws<00:05:05.260> inside<00:05:05.770> there<00:05:06.010> and

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
put some screws inside there and

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.280 
put some screws inside there and
actually<00:05:06.760> hold<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.270> place<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:08.110> then<00:05:08.260> I

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
actually hold that in place and then I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.630 
actually hold that in place and then I
went<00:05:08.470> ahead<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:08.680> put<00:05:08.890> a<00:05:08.919> little<00:05:09.070> bit<00:05:09.220> of<00:05:09.310> RTV

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
went ahead and put a little bit of RTV

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.880 
went ahead and put a little bit of RTV
sealant<00:05:09.970> around<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.600> edges<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.050> it<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.770> to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
sealant around the edges of it just to

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.680 
sealant around the edges of it just to
make<00:05:12.040> sure<00:05:12.070> that's<00:05:12.490> an<00:05:12.610> airtight<00:05:13.030> seal<00:05:13.330> and

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
make sure that's an airtight seal and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.330 
make sure that's an airtight seal and
then<00:05:14.410> I'll<00:05:14.530> go<00:05:14.680> ahead<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.980> take<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.280> and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
then I'll go ahead and take this and

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.060 
then I'll go ahead and take this and
mount<00:05:15.669> it<00:05:15.790> directly<00:05:15.880> back<00:05:16.300> on<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.660> bike<00:05:17.070> in

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
mount it directly back on the bike in

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.580 
mount it directly back on the bike in
place<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:19.030> other<00:05:19.150> filter<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:20.470> that

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
place of the other filter and that

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.550 
place of the other filter and that
allows<00:05:20.830> me<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.250> mount<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:22.810> classic<00:05:23.320> style

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
allows me to mount this classic style
