00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
checkpoint so basically this is a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
checkpoint so basically this is a
building<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> you'd<00:00:37.649> find<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> road<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
building that you'd find on the road and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
it'll contain some stormtroopers now

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979 
it'll contain some stormtroopers now
check<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.190> cargo<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.629> check<00:00:42.840> your

check your cargo and it check your

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
check your cargo and it check your
vehicle<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.309> take<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
vehicle and they can take you on the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.970 
vehicle and they can take you on the
side<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> hold<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.079> case<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.710> need<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
side and hold you in case they need to

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.869 
side and hold you in case they need to
interrogate<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
interrogate you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.180 
interrogate you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so you can see the rebel speeder got

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
so you can see the rebel speeder got
shot<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.000> fire<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.690> then<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
shot there it's on fire and then you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
shot there it's on fire and then you
have<00:00:52.469> four<00:00:52.710> rebels<00:00:53.039> they're<00:00:53.190> charging<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.879> the

have four rebels they're charging on the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.740 
have four rebels they're charging on the
sides<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:56.149> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> contained

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
sides of it we have kind of contained

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.139 
sides of it we have kind of contained
our<00:00:58.050> containment<00:00:58.829> areas<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> either

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
our containment areas so they can either

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
our containment areas so they can either
store<00:01:00.390> prisoners<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.260> equipment

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
store prisoners there or just equipment

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 
store prisoners there or just equipment
that<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.140> top

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that they need so on this one the top

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.969 
that they need so on this one the top
simply<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.129> lifts<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> then

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
simply just lifts off there and then

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.200 
simply just lifts off there and then
this<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.610> speeder<00:01:09.000> right

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

this one we have a little speeder right
there<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.200> side<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
there and then on the other side we have

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.770 
there and then on the other side we have
some<00:01:15.990> cargo<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.710> gun<00:01:19.710> crates

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
some cargo we have some gun crates

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.120

full of guns there and that's the main

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.100 
full of guns there and that's the main
reason<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> rebels<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.570> storming

this<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.560> checkpoint<00:01:29.430> area<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.600> get<00:01:30.750> hold

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this little checkpoint area to get hold

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
this little checkpoint area to get hold
of<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.259> speeder<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.070> weapons<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
of that speeder and the weapons so that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260 
of that speeder and the weapons so that
they<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.590> bring<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.770> supplies<00:01:35.119> for<00:01:36.119> their

the<00:01:43.770> checkpoint<00:01:44.600> itself<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the checkpoint itself you can see the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
the checkpoint itself you can see the
different<00:01:50.640> techniques<00:01:50.909> use<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.479> really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
so that does it for this mini mark

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.580 
so that does it for this mini mark
