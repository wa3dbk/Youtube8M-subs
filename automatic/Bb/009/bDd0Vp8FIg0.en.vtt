00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hello, friends, what about, today I decided 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.190
 change background taking advantage of that 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.170
 I'm visiting here in Holland ando 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.680
 visiting my sister and well I said 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.449
 let me take advantage because because it provides 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.180
 precisely here I bought the base of 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.660
 burgio to the health and mix that is this 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.520
 is this is the serum there are two not what 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.640
 forget because I am going to review today 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.670
 is the one that comes in gel format and does not 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.610
 the normal not the standard I want to tell you 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.550
 before starting that I tried with the 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.130
 standard and I did not like it I did not like it for 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.860
 nothing texture especially for my skin 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.320
 I would not say that for all skins to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.899
 all skin types better despite 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.720
 that my skin is normal tends to dry 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 in some points then to me the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.309
 agency mix I found it alone I thought 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 It is very dry for my skin and I decided 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.329
 try with it and with the serum better said 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.920
 which contains this base in the first place 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.090
 let's talk about the content that is what 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.719
 that thicker 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.159
 It does it for me because it has let 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.569
 say that you have a fruit complement 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.850
 hipervitaminado or we are talking 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:22.240
 of my favorite fruit the pomegranate in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.659
 first place has also the berries 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.149
 these are the gogh and gauguin that are 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.450
 super super known because they are 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.850
 antioxidants and also contains lychee 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.399
 another fruit that I like to mention the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.009
 I want to tell you what the base brings here 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.689
 what it says says makeup background in 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.329
 gel is anti instantaneous fatigue 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.849
 glow concentrate 16 hours 16 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.399
 hours I can not tell you why I have not 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.379
 had put for that amount of time 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.450
 If I can tell you what I wear it and 

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.270
 applied is a makeup that looks very 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.520
 natural you do not look at all overloaded 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.880
 you do not feel heavy skin 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.189
 with excess I mean thick with 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.280
 the face but you feel it very very 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.800
 light in the base I'm going to show you 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.250
 within a moment the consistency 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 that has the smell has a very perfume 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.500
 very soft so it's not a problem 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.129
 for people who are hypersensitive 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.959
 to strong smells for example like me 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.650
 I start to sneeze by any 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.690
 thing is not based because it is very good to 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.410
 I really like the aroma that it has for 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.590
 the matter of fruits and it's a therapy 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.440
 they say it's an enriching therapy 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.049
 for the skin with those vitamins that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.819
 they contain such fruits good nothing I 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.489
 here is here my husband is 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.319
 and well and I'm going to record this video I'm going 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.340
 to do a little bit fast here they have 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.769
 this is the consistency of the base and 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.799
 I want to tell you that my tone I did not choose 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.749
 a little bit dark I do not know why when 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.450
 I tried it on my face here can you 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.730
 see and adheres immediately to the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.069
 skin is a very soft feeling very 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.879
 cool that gives you this is number 56 the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.730
 bronze light bronze is called is like a 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.349
 bronze clear that my skin really 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 it's going very well you do not drink too much 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.650
 tanned today true not in spite of 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.680
 that I have a strong natural light but 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.199
 I really feel delighted with the 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.829
 base I want to tell you that the duration 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:42.510
 it is prolonged the coverage is medium 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:46.500
 I want to tell you that you will need 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.469
 they have spots or marks of granites and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.939
 Outbreaks are going to need a clear 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.769
 little bit of corrector I have not put 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.569
 the concealer even though I have some 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.129
 spots under here on the chin 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.329
 but the base later with its coverage 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:04.379
 media has covered them in a very 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:08.370
 very clear very accurate really very well 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.760
 I am pleasantly surprised with the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.390
 zero as I said this is the gel feels 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.540
 cooler in the lighter skin 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.120
 it's excellent for me when it costs 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.180
 good base the base is from the burger brand 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.530
 and burgio is a brand that is known 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.870
 because it has some prices 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.590
 let's say affordable by comparing the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.160
 Mark with others was not cost me 14 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.100
 euros with 50 has 30 ml although you 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.650
 they see that the bottle is that if it looks like 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.540
 big on camera but it 's finite it does not 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.390
 be surprised when you see it in person if 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.140
 they will buy it because the bottle is 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.030
 as compact that 's more elongated 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.730
 that the others that I have was 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.550
 comparing with another base and this one if it's 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.330
 more elongated despite the fact that despite 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.140
 that is fine brings the standard content 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.940
 that are 30 30 milliliters I'm going to 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.490
 keep using it will be like makeup 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.220
 daily I can also combine with 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.520
 Crims lived either to use is 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.889
 very well the skin feels very healthy 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.080
 It is anti fatigue as I told you something of 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.960
 luminosity too and that's something I 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.650
 like and what of course is here promises 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.479
 I do not like that the skin revives the prey 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.340
 you know that they can leave it here below 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.919

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.229

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:45.530
