00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.330 
wanted to test that out and see how it
is<00:02:31.800> now<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.519> still<00:02:32.790> accurate

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
is now you see if it's a still accurate

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630 
is now you see if it's a still accurate
no<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.640> slightly<00:02:36.000> moves<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.750> right<00:02:37.640> it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
no it slightly moves to the right it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.660 
no it slightly moves to the right it's
not<00:02:38.730> bad<00:02:39.000> though<00:02:39.410> slightly<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.709> right<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.190> guess

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
not bad though slightly so right I guess

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.119 
not bad though slightly so right I guess
