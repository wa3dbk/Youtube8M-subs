some of the better TVs we've seen it's
contrast<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.090> also<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> little<00:02:12.599> bit<00:02:12.810> less

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
contrast is also a little bit less

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
contrast is also a little bit less
because

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
because

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
because
you<00:02:13.860> achieving<00:02:14.220> those<00:02:14.400> deep<00:02:14.760> blacks<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.360> TV

you achieving those deep blacks the TV
actually<00:02:16.080> tends<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> mute<00:02:16.560> highlights<00:02:17.010> a

actually tends to mute highlights a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.440 
actually tends to mute highlights a
little<00:02:17.280> bit<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.640> slightly<00:02:18.270> less

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450

contrast color is very accurate although

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.310 
contrast color is very accurate although
again<00:02:21.120> there's<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.450> little<00:02:21.780> bit<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.110> orange

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
