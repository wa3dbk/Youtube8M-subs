 blanket will allow the equator to attend 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.490
 traffic of ships and cargo that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.230
 Join us to know the work 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.890
 the concept of port development 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.500
 blanket is to position it as a port of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.940
 international transfer of cargo 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.010
 through the granting of services and

 effectively following the presentation 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 of the mobility strategic plan that 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.900
 in port and port airport matters 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.690
 road determines what is the 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.830
 planning that governs national 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.830
 begins and specifically in the sector 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.300
 port consists of an investment in 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.690
 the port of blanket to develop its 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.010
 infrastructure and in that way power 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.200
 provide a better service to the commerce 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.149
 outside in this context there are three 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.860
 bidding companies that aspire to 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.380

 investments will be 951 million 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.940
 dollars in the 22 years that lasts 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 initially the concession the new 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.920
 dealer will be announced on 25 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.150
 next august 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 currently also the mystery 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.960
 transport rushed to a few hours 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.580
 distributed maintenance that entailed 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.590
 also to the development of the port in order 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 that are ready consisting of the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.970
 repair and rehabilitation of the

 international gogh with a reinforcement 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 to increase capacity 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.119
 resistance invites these springs 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.430
 since they already adapt of more than 40 years of 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.570
 construction and service because it merited 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.110
 and to a reinforcement the port of 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.270
 blanket is 25 nautical miles an hour 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.030
 of the international traffic route and to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.909
 only 600 miles a day from the channel

 Panama is a port open to the sea without 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.440
 Access channels with a depth 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.369
 natural 12 meters and depressions of 15 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.009
 and 18 meters only 150 and 400 meters from 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.810
 distance from the breakwater its privileged 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.340
 facilities are in a straight line to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.080
 countries of the Asian basin of 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 peaceful that has great movement 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.980
 good international represents a lot 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.409
 a lot because 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.690
 it's just needed sometimes there's 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.209
 several enough boats that come to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.250
 port to download arrives for 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.330
 download and sometimes have no place 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.640
 then you have to wait sometimes 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.010
 several days to download one was 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.590
 another and so on 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.200
 but nevertheless 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.910
 the expansion that will be made in the future 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 not too far away you can maneuver and the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.120
 military both the arrival and departure of 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.800
 these ships to be able to operate 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.049
 openly without any portrait during 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.459
 all the stay in port these are the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.769
 initiatives that the government promotes 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.569
