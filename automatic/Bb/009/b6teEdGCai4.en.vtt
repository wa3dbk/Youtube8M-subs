this big touchpad in the middle that's

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.310 
this big touchpad in the middle that's
also<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.850> button<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.600> think<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.900> actually<00:04:07.200> bring

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
also a button I think you actually bring

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.870 
also a button I think you actually bring
up<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.769> call<00:04:07.950> duty<00:04:08.100> leaderboards<00:04:08.700> in

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
up like the call duty leaderboards in

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.670 
up like the call duty leaderboards in
Call<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.150> Duty<00:04:09.510> when<00:04:09.989> you<00:04:10.080> press<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.320> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
Call of Duty when you press that and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.350 
Call of Duty when you press that and
things<00:04:10.860> like<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.459> I'm<00:04:11.910> sure<00:04:12.060> other

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
things like that and I'm sure other

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.880 
things like that and I'm sure other
games<00:04:12.600> would<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.200> cool<00:04:13.350> uses<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.800> it

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
games would have really cool uses for it

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.410 
games would have really cool uses for it
as<00:04:13.950> well<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.430> cool<00:04:14.640> looks<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.269> it's

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
as well so that's cool looks like it's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.140 
as well so that's cool looks like it's
