Fahrenheit um so you know I decided well

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
setting and tried to curl them it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.399 
setting and tried to curl them it
flipped<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> ends<00:01:35.729> under<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.689> maybe

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
flipped the ends under for like maybe

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.770 
flipped the ends under for like maybe
two<00:01:37.560> minutes<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.400> even<00:01:39.329> after<00:01:39.600> putting

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.639 
went ahead and put it on the high
setting<00:01:46.979> decided<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> try<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.390> still<00:01:49.350> didn't

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.730 
setting decided to try it still didn't
curl<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.210> also<00:01:51.570> didn't<00:01:52.110> damage<00:01:52.350> them

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
curl them but it also didn't damage them

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.200

the<00:02:10.150> extensions<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:11.080> know<00:02:11.230> I'd<00:02:11.350> pull

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
the extensions and so you know I'd pull

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.860 
the extensions and so you know I'd pull
like<00:02:12.100> this<00:02:12.280> part<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.000> straighten<00:02:13.720> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
like this part up and straighten this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.660 
like this part up and straighten this
and<00:02:14.170> put<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.440> later<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.190> then<00:02:15.340> hold<00:02:15.520> on

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and put that later in and then hold on

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.460 
and put that later in and then hold on
you<00:02:16.000> know<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.420> do<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.200> I

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you know and do it like that and I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.900 
you know and do it like that and I
straightened<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.280> went<00:02:18.430> inside<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.760> all

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
straightened it as I went inside of all

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.880 
straightened it as I went inside of all
at<00:02:19.090> once<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.050> can<00:02:20.290> make<00:02:20.410> sure<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> was<00:02:20.770> a

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
at once so that I can make sure it was a

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.940 
at once so that I can make sure it was a
screen<00:02:21.250> right<00:02:21.490> um<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:23.140> know<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.350> did<00:02:23.740> go

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
screen right um and you know I did go

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.400 
screen right um and you know I did go
over<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.340> extensions<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:25.180> couple<00:02:25.690> times<00:02:25.930> you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
over the extensions a couple times you

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.500 
over the extensions a couple times you
know<00:02:26.500> mostly<00:02:26.890> accident<00:02:27.460> right<00:02:27.820> whatever

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
know mostly accident right whatever

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.480 
know mostly accident right whatever
oh<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:30.360> haven't<00:02:31.360> tried<00:02:31.600> anything<00:02:32.080> over<00:02:32.620> 340<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
oh I haven't tried anything over 340 and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.360 
oh I haven't tried anything over 340 and
I<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.240> I<00:02:34.330> have<00:02:34.510> my<00:02:34.720> flat<00:02:35.410> iron<00:02:35.590> set<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.160> like

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
I think I have my flat iron set to like

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.420 
I think I have my flat iron set to like
320<00:02:36.940> right<00:02:37.120> now<00:02:37.270> uh<00:02:38.010> typically<00:02:39.010> don't<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.250> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
320 right now uh typically don't like to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.560 
320 right now uh typically don't like to
go<00:02:39.550> any<00:02:39.670> higher<00:02:39.760> than<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.150> cuz<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.540> just

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
go any higher than that cuz it just

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.590 
go any higher than that cuz it just
seems<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.930> finer<00:02:41.200> hair<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:42.370> um<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.300> know<00:02:43.330> do

seems a finer hair but um you know do

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.790 
seems a finer hair but um you know do
you<00:02:43.690> think<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.990> extensions<00:02:44.500> out<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.740> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
they feel and look just like they did

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.340 
they feel and look just like they did
when<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:21.580> came<00:03:21.610> out<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> package<00:03:22.239> I'm<00:03:22.930> so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
when they came out of the package I'm so

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.370 
when they came out of the package I'm so
happy<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.890> them<00:03:24.070> um<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.959> know<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.260> right

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
happy with them um you know and right

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.750 
happy with them um you know and right
now<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.590> can<00:03:26.800> see<00:03:26.950> I've<00:03:27.070> got<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.370> clips<00:03:27.580> on

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
now you can see I've got the clips on

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.440 
now you can see I've got the clips on
there<00:03:27.940> spray<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:30.160> I'm<00:03:30.280> thinking<00:03:30.910> that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
there spray but I'm thinking that

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.330 
there spray but I'm thinking that
because<00:03:31.750> they<00:03:31.900> did<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.320> well<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.950> glue<00:03:33.250> them

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
because they did so well I and glue them

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.460 
because they did so well I and glue them
in<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:34.510> way<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> don't<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.140> mess<00:03:35.320> with

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
in that way I don't have to mess with

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.050 
in that way I don't have to mess with
them<00:03:35.590> every<00:03:35.800> day<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.250> they'll<00:03:36.550> be<00:03:36.640> easier<00:03:36.940> to

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
them every day and they'll be easier to

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.040 
them every day and they'll be easier to
hide<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.100> guess<00:03:39.370> basically<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.750> bottom

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
hide but I guess basically the bottom

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.290 
hide but I guess basically the bottom
line<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.530> they<00:03:41.860> are<00:03:42.010> really<00:03:42.760> really<00:03:43.150> really

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
line is they are really really really

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.330 
line is they are really really really
good<00:03:43.540> extensions<00:03:44.080> for<00:03:44.440> such<00:03:45.070> a<00:03:45.100> low<00:03:45.340> price<00:03:45.720> um

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
good extensions for such a low price um

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.640 
good extensions for such a low price um
you<00:03:48.340> know<00:03:48.459> they<00:03:48.850> seem<00:03:49.570> like<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.930> last<00:03:49.959> card<00:03:50.560> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
long time but I would definitely
