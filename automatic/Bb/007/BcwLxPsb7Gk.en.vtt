 to the insurrection istes of the planets 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.580
 destroyed by the young man to this with the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.830
 so that the recent news does not 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 scare the general population and avoid 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.170
 so a chaos among the masses 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.840
 on the other hand the prophet of grief 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.880
 considered it prudent to send a 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.240

 humans to keep hidden the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.320
 secret the new prophets had 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.380

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.970
 combat skills 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.310
 in addition the brooks were still of low class 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.170
 within the copinh hierarchy so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.260

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.000
 the appointment of a new inquisitor 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.000
 under the orders of the prophets caused 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.639
 rage among the entities the opposition to 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.099

 the policies of the new prophets 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.600
 thus consolidating the power for their 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.470
 leaders during the course of the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.780
 years 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.780
 the admiral code fought the forces 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.180
 of the young man and the NGO, he said 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.090
 war in secret during one of the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 fighting an elite was seriously injured 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.280
 but captured alive 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.440
 during the mandate of the prophets he was 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.319
 ordered all young people to learn the 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.300
 human language this in order to 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.949
 capture ships and prisoners for 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.520
 get the location of other settlers 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:50.770
 humans so when caught this 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:55.000
 He could be questioned by his hands 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.510
 we are the glorious saints 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.710
 heirs 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:06.930
 because you attack us by being 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:10.220
 set as unclean a scourge that 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.220
 must do 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.270
 knowing that the enemy would not stop 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.600
 until destroying humanity by 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.150
 complete the admiral created a protocol 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.400
 of rules that should be followed for 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.500
 prevent the young person from finding the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.950
 land or any of its colonies 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.299
 said protocol would be known as the 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.619
 protocol co 

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:35.599
 since our enemies do not 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:37.729
 they will stop until they destroy completely 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.709
 our race and watching for their 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.409
 blind attacks that still do not discover the 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:45.049
 Location of the land is indispensable 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.819
 that the following rules are followed if 

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:49.609
 we want to preserve the location of the 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.909
 land and its colonies far from the 

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:56.889
 young man's hands the prisoner better 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:06:01.039
