00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.980
 pressing more tone for a better view ie we have a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.420
 differential here in the original photograph 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.550

 copied in one 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.829
 I can minimize that now finally use the tool and above all 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 which is located in the dollars bar that is a small point that a 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.239
 brechinha 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.919
 swazi always initially and the margins force the gara to

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:43.959
 28 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.239
 with this selected work I will only warn in a way to distort the skin 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.209
 of the character 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.409
 that's how it ended up working really looks like a painting to the eye 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.359
 subsequently do one before and after you will see that the difference of the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.669
 our work with smooth movements 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.669
 the honda circle equipped by circumventing it that the skin of the character modifying its 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.910
 texture is a work of patience 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.359
 however the final result is very interesting 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.569
 I'm doing the part of the face here and at home with the car started to be able to do 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.419
 this with a tranquility of the world distorting it here the idea is that 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.729
 really gets a little distorted from the harbor a painting is never made 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:26.219
 mainly al ahli is made comprehensively yes we go here 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.239
 distorted all the skin promised us final result but here caern is 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.569
 lightly - both be obtained I'm not half the face that I because I go 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.089
 paste another part that we see difference from one to another I think 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.159
 it's already satisfactory so far I'll do the following diesel dump here 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.540
 my complete tool norm you can a thousand team found same prices 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:50.019
 You can make it better to see a little more by selecting which half of the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.709
 face of the character go portugalete from my keyboard back in my palette of 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.169
 blazer enabled the given leadership of the original image after that so that 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.449
 our work has an even greater highlight of the client and salesperson meeting j 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.199
 and in law the copy of pituba and mold multiplan haia 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.509
 see the difference 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.789
 now yes we really have an effect 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.260
 very special here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.539
 lately 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.569
