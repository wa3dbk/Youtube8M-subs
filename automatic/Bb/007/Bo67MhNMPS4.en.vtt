00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.260

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.560
 What is it that you can explain a 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.860
 little bit why did you wish that I 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.840
 Vienna 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 so because I stopped the cigarette 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.720
 four years ago the prepaid these ten 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.520
 kilos I never really have time to 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.020
 prepare me a meal I have schedules 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.460
 who are constantly changing so there are two 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.720
 three days in a row it goes sandwiches 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.550
 salads finally a little bit of everything and 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.870
 anything and little cookies 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.460
 because we had the time for it 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.899
 when you see there agree the goal 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.780
 today is to see together a 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.970
 little quick easy recipes to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.500
 do and eat balanced okay 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.780
 so here we do today we will do 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.690
 a veggie based input or 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.060
 raw zucchini with tomatoes 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.850
 cherries agree courses I believed so 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.070
 yes she can very well eat raw and in 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.650
 the more we have the interest to preserve 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.180
 vitamins and minerals and then 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.430
 then in a dish of resistance we go 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.890
 make a recipe based on chicken that 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.720
 is a rather lean meat with some 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.520
 mustard and cream 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.920
 ok accompanied by vegetables such 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 carrots and cereals and pulses 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.789
 for the starchy okay and for dessert 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.399
 as I know you do not necessarily like 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.049
 the cheese and ben I actually chose to 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.600
 make yoghurt that is very good 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.659
 also cheese with a fruit base 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.249
 frozen and then small nuggets of 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.039
 chocolate that for rape on chocolate 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.539
 I love that here you go 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.880
 okay so christian let's go in 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.280
 made preparing the entrance is based on 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 caujac with cherry tomatoes and a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.069
 Vinaigrette 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.530
 these are two vegetables that are poor in 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.270
 calories and high fiber and suddenly 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.429
 the fact that they are input 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 immediately brought full of satiety 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.119
 from the beginning of the meal and so it allows 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 to eat a little less of the dish of 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.289
 resistance is a little bit less of the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.359
 okay dessert here we go really 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.219
 replace the mustard with honey it 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.909
 will remain the base if you put a spoon 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.709
 honey coffee 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.029
 you lead Cairo to coffee and balsamic 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.079
 human teaspoon of oil and 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:03.340
 after we will put a teaspoon 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.490
 of water it allows to lighten the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.619
 vinaigrette then live there is more than 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.360
 oath and therefore there are later 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.490
 christian does one have an entry of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.110
 crudités what is interesting it is 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.330
 crudity brings speed 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 and minerals and above all brings the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.600
 vitamin c found only in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 crudités and that is essential 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.680
 for operation
