Top Gear Presents:

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.080
"Sideways or in Circles"

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.160
We argued at TG whether spectacular driving is as fast as effectual driving.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.700
Or put simply - whether it's faster to blaze around the track sideways or maybe to drive classically

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
and go in a circle without trying to impress spectators.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.120
We chose a place to check it out - it's a kart circuit near MotoArena ToruÅ„.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.560
And we chose two radically different cars - the one I'm sitting in now,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.880
which is a production Ford Transit with a 2.2-litre Diesel engine with 140hp.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.300
It's a 140 Sport model.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.880
And a worthy opponent - Mr. Marcin Wicik will drive a Transit

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.740
with a V8 petrol engine with a powerful output of 400hp.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.220
