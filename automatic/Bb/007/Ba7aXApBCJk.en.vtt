00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
we know now it seems to be a very

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859

disengaged<00:01:32.159> president<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.450> if<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:33.780> had

would<00:01:36.509> made<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> big<00:01:36.990> difference<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.650> not
