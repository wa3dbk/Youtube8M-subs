00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
between gold and Xbox screen and it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.020 
between gold and Xbox screen and it
actually<00:00:42.390> looks<00:00:42.780> pretty<00:00:42.930> cool<00:00:43.230> because

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
actually looks pretty cool because

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.340 
actually looks pretty cool because
yellow<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.570> different<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> goal

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
yellow is a lot different from the goal

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.450 
yellow is a lot different from the goal
the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> color<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.820> everything<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
the way the color is and everything and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
the way the color is and everything and
it<00:00:50.460> looks<00:00:50.670> real<00:00:50.850> nice<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.590> next<00:00:52.620> thing

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it looks real nice so the next thing

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
it looks real nice so the next thing
we're<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.489> gunmetal<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.239> guess

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

this<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.140> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> looks<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.680> gray

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
this one kind of looks like a gray

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.660 
this one kind of looks like a gray
bluish<00:00:56.699> color<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.510> guess<00:00:57.539> good<00:00:58.289> thing<00:00:58.609> but<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it looks looks pretty nice i think i

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.280

so it's pretty fun and the colors look

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
so it's pretty fun and the colors look
pretty<00:01:13.229> cool<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:15.090> didn't<00:01:15.390> pre-order

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
pretty cool on if you didn't pre-order

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.710 
pretty cool on if you didn't pre-order
it<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> sucks<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it that kind of sucks because the the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
purdah colors are really cool and they

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
purdah colors are really cool and they
make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> character<00:01:21.750> look<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.170> nice<00:01:22.290> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130

there's<00:01:23.340> black<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.710> least

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's black here and this is my least

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
there's black here and this is my least
favorite<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.759> why<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> don't<00:01:27.479> know

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
favorite I don't know why I don't know

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.880 
favorite I don't know why I don't know
why<00:01:27.659> they<00:01:27.780> did<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> blocking<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.650> could<00:01:28.799> have

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
why they did a blocking they could have

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.530 
why they did a blocking they could have
done<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.040> purple<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.670> guess<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> purple

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
done a purple one I guess the purple

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.830 
done a purple one I guess the purple
would<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> bit<00:01:30.840> cooler<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.009> guess<00:01:32.509> blacks<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
would a bit cooler but I guess blacks in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.890 
would a bit cooler but I guess blacks in
i<00:01:34.170> guess<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.420> still<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.720> there's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
i guess but you can still see there's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
i guess but you can still see there's
some<00:01:36.930> colors<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> them<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.520> completely

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
some colors on them it's not completely

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
some colors on them it's not completely
black<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.310> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> confusing<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.509> uh<00:01:43.670> that's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
black so kind of confusing but uh that's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
black so kind of confusing but uh that's
that's<00:01:45.119> black<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.750> pre-order<00:01:46.140> colors

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that's black for the pre-order colors

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.289 
that's black for the pre-order colors
and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.100> only<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.490> these<00:01:47.670> colors<00:01:48.090> if

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and then you only got these colors if

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
and then you only got these colors if
you<00:01:48.329> preorder<00:01:48.659> crackdown<00:01:49.290> two<00:01:49.470> when<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.979> got
