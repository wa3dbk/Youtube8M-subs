00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.910 
in that John wrote yeah right let me
drop<00:04:40.310> speak<00:04:41.060> write<00:04:41.480> don't<00:04:41.810> tape<00:04:42.380> them<00:04:42.560> up<00:04:42.710> and

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
drop speak write don't tape them up and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.300 
drop speak write don't tape them up and
shut<00:04:43.130> them<00:04:43.280> down<00:04:43.430> right<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:45.650> if<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.070> tune

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
shut them down right and if you tune

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.580 
shut them down right and if you tune
them<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:46.900> then<00:04:47.900> that's<00:04:48.110> what<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.440> all

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
them then then that's what it's all

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.290 
them then then that's what it's all
about<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:49.160> know<00:04:49.280> it<00:04:49.580> but<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:49.880> takes<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.180> little

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
about you know it but it takes a little

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.000 
about you know it but it takes a little
bit<00:04:50.480> of<00:04:50.570> more<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.750> an<00:04:50.840> ear<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.350> know<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.830> easy

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
bit of more of an ear you know it's easy

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.490 
bit of more of an ear you know it's easy
to<00:04:52.100> stick<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.460> pillow<00:04:52.910> or<00:04:52.940> something<00:04:53.180> or<00:04:53.720> tape

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
to stick a pillow or something or tape

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.020 
to stick a pillow or something or tape
all<00:04:54.680> over<00:04:55.010> them<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.220> they<00:04:55.640> don't<00:04:55.730> even<00:04:55.880> have

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
all over them and they don't even have

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.100 
all over them and they don't even have
to<00:04:56.150> be<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.360> tune<00:04:56.540> man<00:04:56.690> because<00:04:56.900> you're<00:04:56.990> just

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
to be in tune man because you're just

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.050 
to be in tune man because you're just
getting<00:04:57.230> up<00:04:57.410> that<00:04:57.440> yeah<00:04:57.980> exactly<00:04:58.220> yeah<00:04:58.850> and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
getting up that yeah exactly yeah and

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.390 
getting up that yeah exactly yeah and
the<00:04:59.960> technique<00:05:00.380> doesn't<00:05:00.590> show<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.250> got

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
the technique doesn't show you got

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.200 
the technique doesn't show you got
technique

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
technique

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.910 
technique
yeah<00:05:02.450> true<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:03.260> was<00:05:03.410> what<00:05:03.590> was<00:05:03.680> cool<00:05:03.860> about

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
yeah true that was what was cool about

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.490 
yeah true that was what was cool about
winning<00:05:04.460> of<00:05:04.520> Billy<00:05:04.730> they<00:05:04.970> kind<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.470> they<00:05:06.470> were

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
winning of Billy they kind of they were

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.560 
winning of Billy they kind of they were
innovators<00:05:07.160> in<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.460> era<00:05:07.640> because<00:05:08.060> they<00:05:08.210> to

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
innovators in that era because they to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.820 
innovators in that era because they to
me<00:05:08.690> they<00:05:08.900> were<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.110> first<00:05:09.290> guys<00:05:09.470> anyway<00:05:09.800> I
