00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.950
 very good and side drone minecraft 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.840
 pattern is a new program 1.7 point 10 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.210
 called the following mode work with 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.550
 Forges and let it install it and we can 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.350
 create posters this way is so 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.540
 great are very cool and we can do 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.150
 a lot of things like for example this 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.580
 for example this or good this is what 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.199
 same then he is handsome he is very handsome 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.790
 It's great because we can do 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.650
 any kind of thing we can write 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.930
 what we want in everything big that 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.220
 we want and with those that we want them with 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.290
 the effect that we want we can put 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.360
 also icons on a poster and the thing 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.400
 which is great but sometimes you see 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.010
 especially the more mods we put 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.409
 more chances there is that there is some 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 incompatibility and that the posters 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.500
 even the chests that previously state 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.239
 looking in other ways he had 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
 avoid them all and left only this 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.019
 because it happened like this was staying 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.159
 transparent that is exactly what 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.780
 It's happening is now left is 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.890
 transparent but is that to be 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.540
 transparent already put in 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 transparent all the posters plus the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.880
 chests and good thing is that you could not see 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.890
 nothing good then good as how 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.690
 decoration is pretty cool but that 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.980
 yes to warn that for now the mod 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.450
 has enough books has enough 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.680
 incompatibilities that in the future 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.350
 I suppose they will be solved 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880
 but for now this happens or this happens 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.500
 that also this letter that you are seeing 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.730
 it also looks semi transparent that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.870
 we can also leave it like this we can 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.580
 make it ourselves to make it look 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.890
 well but this looks like this right now 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.810
 because it's a book then how good 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.580
 this works in principle let's go to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.470
 krafft eo what would this voucher be with 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.300
 four posters plus a frame and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.100
 we would get three the art sing and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.600
 then we do not go to any wall the wall 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 that we want we have already done it or 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 directly go against some 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.140
 site and we put the poster for example 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.610
 here between us this menu comes out we have the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.890
 menu of icons that would be this would be very 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.300
 I facilitate simply choose the icon and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.979
 we get the poster with the icon that 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.960
 we have put for example a 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.610
 diamond as you can see the icon with the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.229
 diamond if for example we put with a 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 block will look in three dimensions as 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.550
 for example this one of giving to done and as 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.229
 You see the block between dimensions 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.820
 that is also pretty cool but 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.040
 apart we have the one of the letters that 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.660
 we can in principle write what 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 we want the more we write 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.160
 as you are seeing then smaller 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.560
 will see but this has a solution in 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.450
 principle the solution is to increase 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.489
 the size of the letter in general is worth 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.470
 when we give skeleton like 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.800
 You see going to increase the size and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.870
 power 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.190
 and even leave the poster thing that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.680
 It's also pretty cool but 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.390
 it's pretty weird then then 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.770
 we will also have the other solution for 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.050
 that aesthetically looks a little 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.390
 better but for now we can do this 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.310
 ok we write this we give it to you 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.930
 see bigger and bigger and then 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.070
 apart from this we can also choose the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.450
 site where we want to see the 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.130
 for example letters that look a bit 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.050
 more to the side or to look a little 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.760
 more down or more up as 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.020
 we also love then the truth 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.270
 that is also pretty cool because 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.040
 we can decide a little where we want 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.530
 Let the letters be seen even by 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.610
 example I want to see the poster or 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 it wants to know the letters but not 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.900
 wants to be the poster / I do if I go 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.240
 makes this hole here the poster 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.710
 I put what I want I put a 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.940
 biggest little so good I 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.020
 I want it to occupy all the work for 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.000
 example but we will not do it so 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.380
 great because this would be a while giving it 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.660
 click here for this to be done 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.690
 bigger and when we have it to a 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.430
 considerable size we do well we are going to 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.690
 go up everything we want and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.100
 even if it disappears from the screen or 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.890
 we are going to keep doing that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.260
 keep going up then worth more or less 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.959
 here it would be a block a couple of them 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.700
 more or less I think that here I could 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.770
 be like that because I do not know 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.349
 at what point it will be fine but it was 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.930
 here and has done and how are you watching it 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.050
 see here the letters and here not on the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.130
 poster a bug 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.850
 bug host fixed that looks for his uncle good 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.600
 because the 14-m exists even if you see 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.340
 locked 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.630
 the poster looks but of course it also 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.580
 can do in different other ways 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.320
 that maybe with a crystal if you 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.360
 we put a good crystal I would see the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.940
 poster but it would follow well that the lyrics 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.680
 and the poster was half-buried 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.880
 then it's pretty cool stallone 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.890
 remove from here I will put it back 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.330
 sand this part and now we are going to 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.470
 put back a poster well let's be 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.880
 also the effects that we can put 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.370
 for example about him a little bit more 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.650
 great to see it again but to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.810
 see to see a little more I think more 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.970
 or less well you can see the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.920
 effects I think that's how we're going to leave is 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.750
 after putting shadow here as you see 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.040
 be a shadow and if we give it back 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.040
 Well we removed it to be able to also 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.960
 in bold you need to be here but 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.790
 you have to put the bold before the girl 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.520
 in bold we put this as you see the 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.870
 letters in bold if we give it here 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.030
 you will see carving although we will have to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.040
 put it also before this we go here 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.720
 As you can see it is shown in bold and 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.420
 we give it here because it will follow the bold or 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.760
 even seeing here and giving 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.460
 to see why I do not have to pass it whole 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.280
 give it here and come back 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.539
 As you can see in bold, I can put it in 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.520
 underlined 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.370
 in this way or I can also put it 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.900
 in italics giving you here then as 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.509
 you see we have enough effect that also 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.280
 they can meet with each other and apart 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.199
 Well, we have, as I said, 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.120
 adjust the precision in x adjusts it to the 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.250
 position that neither adjust the scale that 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.780
 it would be the size of the letters and 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.520
 apart we can also avoid the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.810
 colors to mention a color of 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.259
 predefined like the ones we have here 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.110
 for example or we can edit the level of 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:26.199
 red the green level or the level of 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.270
 blue of the letter and look for a color that 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.530
 we like it, we can and we can 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.570
 do what you see a little more 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.160
 transparent or a little less as you are 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.570
 seeing if I'm taking it away 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 Transparency or the life of transparency 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.349
 Well, you're going to see the lyrics a bit 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.270
 more transparent and it has been done as 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.039
 You see what the letter looks like, it's like a 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.380
 neon letter quite strange but 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.849
 pretty cool too then guys 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.259
 we have nothing else with this mode 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.849
 we only have this remember that 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.250
 he still has some books so 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.389
 sorry but if they come out and has not 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.729
 liked you can click here because 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.719
 we have the following video 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.719
 up to comfort
