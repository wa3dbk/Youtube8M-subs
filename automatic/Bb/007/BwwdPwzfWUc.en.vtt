00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.179
 pity the paths are in the first place 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.980
 to create beautiful objects 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.840
 further can be but with the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.719
 bike still very exact and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 complicated selection or even 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.820
 create beautiful vibrations around you 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.390
 path to create we choose in 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 tool box the fade tool off and on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 now set individual points which differ from 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.969
 alone an object connect to the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.719
 last with the first point too 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.820
 connect 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.680
 Let's keep the control button pressed 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 and drive over the first point over it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.219
 by we are now the cornerstones apart 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 We can draw the object depending on 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.140
 change and consume as you please 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.550
 right in the squad but we can see 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 that our path was taken here 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 and these curved lines so 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.750
 to create these vibrations 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.590
 Let's keep the control button pressed 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 and pull at the corner points 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.130
 assume it as desired by 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.130
 this vibration 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:36.790
 to fill in the picture later 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:39.280
 we suppress it by suppressing it 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.730
 But now we have to execute it in the plane 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.920
 but a new level to concern we go 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.780
 here in the level dog and press left 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 Create a new one below 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.450
 We can now with control 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.180
 and then we fill that 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.479
 can see the whole object better 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.350
 We reject the selection with control 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.090
 shift and a 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.400
 and now here we see that of us 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:16.650
 created object remains in the vehicle 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 However, the path received 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.300
 Now I want you the second way 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.300
 show to create a path 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.230
 So this we draw a one selection 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.230
 object depending on your liking 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:56.720
 and choose in the squad but down ride 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.720
 selection 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:07.080
 Now a path was created as we did 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:10.110
 Here we see the path now 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.489
 with a double click and see that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.640
 now a few hangs has been created 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:24.260
 Now we can with the tatwerkzeug like 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:29.010
 before that change the image and curves and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:33.080
 create more corners and the picture 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.080
 change as you wish 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:57.250
 to fill it out now 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:04.510
 we suppress it as before 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:09.210
 to go to select in the levels 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.210
 levels create a new level again 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:22.680
 and we can now fill in the level 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.680
 comma with control 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:36.900
 discard that is now 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:39.599
 created object and we can too 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.729
 one more path to follow us 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:51.599
 to recognize the better I choose one 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:53.250
 other color out are purple and it 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:05:00.740
 Let's go back to that 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.740
 Tatwerkzeug go here in the vehicle 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:13.849
 and choose to follow suit 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.719
 Here we can make the lines wide 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.030
 choose 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:23.900
 I 'll do nice pixel and lines 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:30.069
 We can define style under forte 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:33.199
 stroke and select a line pattern 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:38.469
 I take the dot now 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:48.259
 dot and then press 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:53.770
 follow this is now the finished 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.770
 object with drawn lines
